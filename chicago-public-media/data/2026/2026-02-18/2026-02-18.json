Grand Ave., will bring \"the IKEA experience closer to where people live, work, socialize and shop — just in a smaller footprint,\" a company spokesperson said, who added that the store is expected to open in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s part of the company’s larger goal of opening 10 stores during the 2026 fiscal year, including in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Fort Collins, Colorado, and Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known for its massive stores, the smaller-format site in Gurnee will be about 66,000 square feet, according to a news release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers will have the chance to shop from a curated selection of 3,000 items, including home furnishings, accessories and small furniture items.&amp;nbsp;There will also be a centralized \"planning area,\" where customers can meet with IKEA's design consultants. And like it's larger warehouse locations, it'll serve its famous Swedish meatballs, as well as hot dogs and cinnamon buns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gurnee store joins IKEA's other locations in Bolingbrook and Schaumburg. IKEA's nearly 310,000-square-foot Bolingbrook store opened in 2005. Schaumburg's location, at over 400,000 square feet, opened in 1998, and at the time, was the company's largest store in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, IKEA opened 14 retail locations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[2025] was a year of meaningful connection and growth despite a challenging external environment,” Rob Olson, interim CEO of IKEA U.S., said in a news release. “Looking ahead to [fiscal year 2026], we will build on this momentum, focusing on continued investment in the U.S. to make IKEA more affordable, accessible and sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;",

There isn’t any point in spending time reading and listening about how good everyone thinks the Redwings are this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are just trying to stay within ourselves and not put pressure on ourselves and have fun,” Wright said. “We are trying our best to tune it out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is going to get a lot harder for Wright and his teammates over the next week. The &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/02/15/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;top-ranked &lt;/a&gt;Redwings are playing the best basketball the area has seen since Glenbard West in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benet knocked off No. 11 Marist 77-68 on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/17/chicago-high-school-basketball-scores-illinois\"   &gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago to win the East Suburban Catholic Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are better than I even thought,” RedHawks coach Brian Hynes said. “They have so many weapons. Our kids played hard. They are the best in the state and hopefully we can see them again in Champaign.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright scored 17 points and 7-1 senior Colin Stack led with 23 points and seven rebounds. Ed Stasys, a 6-8 junior, added 16 points and 12 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High school guards often have trouble feeding big men in the post. That’s not a problem for Benet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every single year our chemistry has gotten better,” Wright said. “Especially now. I feel like I know right where [Stack] is going to be, and I can throw it up for him to dunk it. We have grown a really great connection over these three years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stack’s dunk at the second quarter buzzer gave Benet a 35-33 lead at halftime. The Redwings (29-1, 8-0) opened the second half with a 13-1 burst to take control of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marist senior Charles Barnes Jr. scored 22 points in the second half and finished with 33. Barnes made three three-pointers in the final two minutes to keep the RedHawks (25-5, 5-2) within striking distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s a great player,” Benet coach Gene Heidkamp said. “He is everything we thought he was. And he never quits. He keeps going. Luckily, we made enough plays on the offensive end to have a buffer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright, an Eastern Illinois recruit, has a unique combination of stability and creativity as a point guard. He’s a handful for defenses to worry about all on his own and this season he has two skilled big men to utilize and several talented guards around him, including 6-5 junior Perry Tchiegne (seven points) and 6-3 Ethan Mac Dermot (14 points).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Stasys] changes the game in a lot of ways people don’t realize,” Stack said. “He has such a great motor, and he defends at a high level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-640000\" name=\"image-640000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91cb648/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a1f30c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91f6c2f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Benet&amp;#x27;s Jayden Wright (3) feels good about the Redwings victory over Marist.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91f6c2f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e94548b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91f6c2f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benet’s Jayden Wright (3) feels good about the Redwings victory over Marist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior Kendall Meyers finished with 17 points and seven rebounds for Marist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is nice to have a kid like Barnes that can hit it from the volleyball line three times late in the game when you are down,” Hynes said. “The problem for us is our best games are more balanced scoring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benet is the top seed in the Class 4A Bolingbrook Sectional and the overwhelming favorite to repeat as state champions. But Heidkamp has seen the big favorite lose many times. It happened to him before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know how hard it is to win a state title,” Heidkamp said. “Last year we had five losses and we were the three seed in the sectinal and we won the state championship. You have to be ready for every game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the last year of the ESCC, which is merging with the Catholic League next season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is pretty emotional,” Heidkamp said. “I coached in this league for 33 years. I played in this league. It is the only league I have ever known. I was disappointed when the decision was made [to merge].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I’m really proud of our kids. This was a good way to end it if it had to end. We had to beat St. Pat’s at St. Pat’s and Marist at Marist. Our kids showed a lot of heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-200000\" name=\"html-embed-module-200000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"No Shot Clock, Ep. 202: Breaking down the 3A and 4A state championship contenders\" allowtransparency=\"true\" height=\"150\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);height:150px;\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=2i5vy-1a4a779-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=auto&amp;logo_link=episode_page&amp;btn-skin=c73a3a\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Jesse Louis Jackson was missed by those of us who wanted or needed someone to lead us through these troubled times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a third of the 20th century and more than a decade of this 21st one, the civil rights activist, politician and ordained Baptist minister was camera ready, omnipresent and immanently quotable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was cherished by most Black Americans and vilified by many white Americans. Over the half century I have known  Jackson, I’ve not fallen into either camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a professional journalist who has written a signed op-ed page column for the Chicago Tribune and later for the Chicago Sun-Times; hosted the TV show “Common Ground”; and worked as the editor of a Black Chicago newspaper, there have been times when we got along just fine, and at other times, not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-880000\" name=\"module-880000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were times when my reporting was not to the good reverend’s liking, and he let me know. There were times when what I wrote he thought was right on the mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 1973, I was an assistant editor at Ebony magazine. I was assigned to interview Jackson about “Save the Children,” a movie about the PUSH exposition, featuring the Jackson 5, Marvin Gaye and Bill Withers. The reverend kept me waiting for 45 minutes, then answered my questions in words that rhymed and quipped but were not particularly detailed. I called him out on it. He stood up, then left the room. Fifteen minutes later, I realized I had all I was getting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight years later, as a Tribune reporter, every week I covered his Saturday morning meeting at Operation PUSH. Each week, when he wasn’t in some other city or town, fighting for a racial injustice that he was eager to take on, he’d have some prominent figure as his guest, following it up by the sermon of the week on something white people were doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could bet your bottom dollar that the meetings would feature Jackson’s “I Am Somebody” chorus chant and his well-staged contributions method with two or three businessmen in the audience volunteering to contribute $500 to the cause, followed by lesser pledges immediately before the ushers circulated the collection plates from one row to the next being filled with dollar bills featuring various dead presidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson was a master of the media. He could be called on to confront an editor or news operation where a Black journalist had been fired just because or when that newsroom was obviously a place for whites only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Jackson and Black journalists was often a two-way street. There was the time that Jackson was on a radio show with Derek Hill and one of the callers suggested Black Chicagoans should boycott ChicagoFest because Mayor Jane Byrne appointed whites to the Chicago Housing Authority board, ignoring Black representation. The civil rights leader took up the cause right then and there. The next day I ran into him with Gary Mayor Richard Hatcher while the two were heading into a meeting for Black mayors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked about the instant boycott. Jackson said he was kicking it off because Chicago’s Black voters were being disrespected. I pointed out to Jackson that Stevie Wonder was the marquee attraction at the event on one given day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Have you talked to Stevie?” I asked. “You could have 5,000 protesters out front, and there will be 10,000 Blacks trying to get in to see him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson had a stunned look on his face. It was obvious that was something he hadn’t considered. He told me he didn’t want to reveal all his plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later it was announced that Stevie would not be appearing at ChicagoFest for safety’s sake. The boycott was a huge success, and it was a crucial step in leading to Chicago electing its first Black mayor, Harold Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later, Jackson would take another step. He’d mount a serious attempt at America having a Black president. His first effort didn’t work. Nor did his second one in 1988. But it turned out to be a powerful demonstration that a Black man could get to the White House.  When Barack Obama followed Jackson’s lead 20 years later, becoming America’s first Black president, the civil rights leader witnessed hope not only being kept, but that it had come alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-de0000\" name=\"module-de0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Asked about that strong finish — which included five home runs in the last four games of the regular season and another to open the postseason — he was far more interested in discussing ways he could improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wasn’t satisfied with the season last year,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He zeroed in on his contact rate, which he wants to keep higher, even when he’s hitting for slug. His batting average dropped to .245 as he launched 32 home runs, surpassing his previous career high by 11. At times, he said, there was a disconnect between how his swing felt and what it looked like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I spent some time in the offseason trying to get better at those things,” he said. “Looking back, it’s probably one of the best offseasons I’ve had.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the final year of the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2022/3/16/22980856/cubs-seiya-suzuki-japanese-outfielder\"   &gt;five-year, $85 million contract Suzuki signed in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, when he transitioned to MLB and the Cubs from Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball. As of Monday, the Cubs had not initiated extension talks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Signing with the team, people expect something from me,” he said. “I felt like I haven’t really reached those [expectations] yet. So I think I just need to continue to work on myself and make sure I can repay the team and the fans, and just go out and have a good season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Suzuki first signed, the Cubs talked about him as a player they could grow with, and vice versa. That’s essentially how his first four years in the U.S. have played out. Last year, for the first time, teammates and fans got to see him in the postseason, where he was one of the Cubs’ best offensive performers, along with Michael Busch and Nico Hoerner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s such a talented hitter,” left fielder Ian Happ said. “His swing is beautiful, but his ability to just impact the baseball is really special. That’s in there, and it’s in there all the time. . . . He’s a huge force for us in the lineup.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2023/2/28/23619152/cubs-seiya-suzuki-diagnosed-with-moderate-oblique-strain-opening-day-wbc-team-japan\"   &gt;After missing the 2023 WBC&lt;/a&gt; with an oblique injury, he’s now set to enter the regular season riding the momentum of a WBC run for the first time. Team Japan, the reigning champion, is expected to go far. That’s not guaranteed to kick-start Suzuki’s season with the Cubs, but he showed in the playoffs last year that he has a knack for rising to the occasion in these sorts of settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just fun being in that mode,” manager Craig Counsell said. “That’s why WBC is so attractive. October is like, ‘Just give me more’ — that’s what everybody feels when you go through it. So that’s why the guys love the WBC, because it gives them that if you can get to the right games.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Suzuki’s usual position is right field, he confirmed he’ll slide over to center for Team Japan. In preparation, he’s set to play center for the Cubs on Friday and Sunday as they open Cactus League play. He leaves Monday to join his national team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No worries there,” Suzuki said. “I feel like I’ve been moving well. That’s something I worked on in the offseason. And getting those reps in, I think that’s going to be beneficial for me in the season, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grinning, he added: “If Pete wants an off day or something, that’s my chance to play center field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, items=[{type=Image, category=[{items=[MLB]}], _styledTemplate=null, description=[{items=[Clark stepped down after an internal investigation into an “inappropriate” relationship with his sister-in-law, who had been hired by the union in 2023, according to an ESPN report.]}], imageAlignment=null, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb, isFeatured=false, wordCount=173, authors=[{bio=[{items=[USA Today is a multi-platform news and information media company that prints across the United States and internationally.
