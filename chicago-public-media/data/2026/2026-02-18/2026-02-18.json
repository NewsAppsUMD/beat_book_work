Grand Ave., will bring \"the IKEA experience closer to where people live, work, socialize and shop — just in a smaller footprint,\" a company spokesperson said, who added that the store is expected to open in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s part of the company’s larger goal of opening 10 stores during the 2026 fiscal year, including in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Fort Collins, Colorado, and Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known for its massive stores, the smaller-format site in Gurnee will be about 66,000 square feet, according to a news release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers will have the chance to shop from a curated selection of 3,000 items, including home furnishings, accessories and small furniture items.&amp;nbsp;There will also be a centralized \"planning area,\" where customers can meet with IKEA's design consultants. And like it's larger warehouse locations, it'll serve its famous Swedish meatballs, as well as hot dogs and cinnamon buns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gurnee store joins IKEA's other locations in Bolingbrook and Schaumburg. IKEA's nearly 310,000-square-foot Bolingbrook store opened in 2005. Schaumburg's location, at over 400,000 square feet, opened in 1998, and at the time, was the company's largest store in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, IKEA opened 14 retail locations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[2025] was a year of meaningful connection and growth despite a challenging external environment,” Rob Olson, interim CEO of IKEA U.S., said in a news release. “Looking ahead to [fiscal year 2026], we will build on this momentum, focusing on continued investment in the U.S. to make IKEA more affordable, accessible and sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;",

There isn’t any point in spending time reading and listening about how good everyone thinks the Redwings are this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are just trying to stay within ourselves and not put pressure on ourselves and have fun,” Wright said. “We are trying our best to tune it out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is going to get a lot harder for Wright and his teammates over the next week. The &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/02/15/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;top-ranked &lt;/a&gt;Redwings are playing the best basketball the area has seen since Glenbard West in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benet knocked off No. 11 Marist 77-68 on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/17/chicago-high-school-basketball-scores-illinois\"   &gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago to win the East Suburban Catholic Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are better than I even thought,” RedHawks coach Brian Hynes said. “They have so many weapons. Our kids played hard. They are the best in the state and hopefully we can see them again in Champaign.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright scored 17 points and 7-1 senior Colin Stack led with 23 points and seven rebounds. Ed Stasys, a 6-8 junior, added 16 points and 12 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High school guards often have trouble feeding big men in the post. That’s not a problem for Benet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every single year our chemistry has gotten better,” Wright said. “Especially now. I feel like I know right where [Stack] is going to be, and I can throw it up for him to dunk it. We have grown a really great connection over these three years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stack’s dunk at the second quarter buzzer gave Benet a 35-33 lead at halftime. The Redwings (29-1, 8-0) opened the second half with a 13-1 burst to take control of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marist senior Charles Barnes Jr. scored 22 points in the second half and finished with 33. Barnes made three three-pointers in the final two minutes to keep the RedHawks (25-5, 5-2) within striking distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s a great player,” Benet coach Gene Heidkamp said. “He is everything we thought he was. And he never quits. He keeps going. Luckily, we made enough plays on the offensive end to have a buffer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright, an Eastern Illinois recruit, has a unique combination of stability and creativity as a point guard. He’s a handful for defenses to worry about all on his own and this season he has two skilled big men to utilize and several talented guards around him, including 6-5 junior Perry Tchiegne (seven points) and 6-3 Ethan Mac Dermot (14 points).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Stasys] changes the game in a lot of ways people don’t realize,” Stack said. “He has such a great motor, and he defends at a high level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-640000\" name=\"image-640000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91cb648/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a1f30c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91f6c2f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Benet&amp;#x27;s Jayden Wright (3) feels good about the Redwings victory over Marist.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91f6c2f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e94548b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91f6c2f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benet’s Jayden Wright (3) feels good about the Redwings victory over Marist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior Kendall Meyers finished with 17 points and seven rebounds for Marist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is nice to have a kid like Barnes that can hit it from the volleyball line three times late in the game when you are down,” Hynes said. “The problem for us is our best games are more balanced scoring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benet is the top seed in the Class 4A Bolingbrook Sectional and the overwhelming favorite to repeat as state champions. But Heidkamp has seen the big favorite lose many times. It happened to him before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know how hard it is to win a state title,” Heidkamp said. “Last year we had five losses and we were the three seed in the sectinal and we won the state championship. You have to be ready for every game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the last year of the ESCC, which is merging with the Catholic League next season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is pretty emotional,” Heidkamp said. “I coached in this league for 33 years. I played in this league. It is the only league I have ever known. I was disappointed when the decision was made [to merge].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I’m really proud of our kids. This was a good way to end it if it had to end. We had to beat St. Pat’s at St. Pat’s and Marist at Marist. Our kids showed a lot of heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-200000\" name=\"html-embed-module-200000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"No Shot Clock, Ep. 202: Breaking down the 3A and 4A state championship contenders\" allowtransparency=\"true\" height=\"150\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);height:150px;\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=2i5vy-1a4a779-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=auto&amp;logo_link=episode_page&amp;btn-skin=c73a3a\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Jesse Louis Jackson was missed by those of us who wanted or needed someone to lead us through these troubled times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a third of the 20th century and more than a decade of this 21st one, the civil rights activist, politician and ordained Baptist minister was camera ready, omnipresent and immanently quotable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was cherished by most Black Americans and vilified by many white Americans. Over the half century I have known  Jackson, I’ve not fallen into either camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a professional journalist who has written a signed op-ed page column for the Chicago Tribune and later for the Chicago Sun-Times; hosted the TV show “Common Ground”; and worked as the editor of a Black Chicago newspaper, there have been times when we got along just fine, and at other times, not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-880000\" name=\"module-880000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were times when my reporting was not to the good reverend’s liking, and he let me know. There were times when what I wrote he thought was right on the mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 1973, I was an assistant editor at Ebony magazine. I was assigned to interview Jackson about “Save the Children,” a movie about the PUSH exposition, featuring the Jackson 5, Marvin Gaye and Bill Withers. The reverend kept me waiting for 45 minutes, then answered my questions in words that rhymed and quipped but were not particularly detailed. I called him out on it. He stood up, then left the room. Fifteen minutes later, I realized I had all I was getting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight years later, as a Tribune reporter, every week I covered his Saturday morning meeting at Operation PUSH. Each week, when he wasn’t in some other city or town, fighting for a racial injustice that he was eager to take on, he’d have some prominent figure as his guest, following it up by the sermon of the week on something white people were doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could bet your bottom dollar that the meetings would feature Jackson’s “I Am Somebody” chorus chant and his well-staged contributions method with two or three businessmen in the audience volunteering to contribute $500 to the cause, followed by lesser pledges immediately before the ushers circulated the collection plates from one row to the next being filled with dollar bills featuring various dead presidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson was a master of the media. He could be called on to confront an editor or news operation where a Black journalist had been fired just because or when that newsroom was obviously a place for whites only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Jackson and Black journalists was often a two-way street. There was the time that Jackson was on a radio show with Derek Hill and one of the callers suggested Black Chicagoans should boycott ChicagoFest because Mayor Jane Byrne appointed whites to the Chicago Housing Authority board, ignoring Black representation. The civil rights leader took up the cause right then and there. The next day I ran into him with Gary Mayor Richard Hatcher while the two were heading into a meeting for Black mayors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked about the instant boycott. Jackson said he was kicking it off because Chicago’s Black voters were being disrespected. I pointed out to Jackson that Stevie Wonder was the marquee attraction at the event on one given day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Have you talked to Stevie?” I asked. “You could have 5,000 protesters out front, and there will be 10,000 Blacks trying to get in to see him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson had a stunned look on his face. It was obvious that was something he hadn’t considered. He told me he didn’t want to reveal all his plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later it was announced that Stevie would not be appearing at ChicagoFest for safety’s sake. The boycott was a huge success, and it was a crucial step in leading to Chicago electing its first Black mayor, Harold Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later, Jackson would take another step. He’d mount a serious attempt at America having a Black president. His first effort didn’t work. Nor did his second one in 1988. But it turned out to be a powerful demonstration that a Black man could get to the White House.  When Barack Obama followed Jackson’s lead 20 years later, becoming America’s first Black president, the civil rights leader witnessed hope not only being kept, but that it had come alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-de0000\" name=\"module-de0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Asked about that strong finish — which included five home runs in the last four games of the regular season and another to open the postseason — he was far more interested in discussing ways he could improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wasn’t satisfied with the season last year,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He zeroed in on his contact rate, which he wants to keep higher, even when he’s hitting for slug. His batting average dropped to .245 as he launched 32 home runs, surpassing his previous career high by 11. At times, he said, there was a disconnect between how his swing felt and what it looked like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I spent some time in the offseason trying to get better at those things,” he said. “Looking back, it’s probably one of the best offseasons I’ve had.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the final year of the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2022/3/16/22980856/cubs-seiya-suzuki-japanese-outfielder\"   &gt;five-year, $85 million contract Suzuki signed in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, when he transitioned to MLB and the Cubs from Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball. As of Monday, the Cubs had not initiated extension talks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Signing with the team, people expect something from me,” he said. “I felt like I haven’t really reached those [expectations] yet. So I think I just need to continue to work on myself and make sure I can repay the team and the fans, and just go out and have a good season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Suzuki first signed, the Cubs talked about him as a player they could grow with, and vice versa. That’s essentially how his first four years in the U.S. have played out. Last year, for the first time, teammates and fans got to see him in the postseason, where he was one of the Cubs’ best offensive performers, along with Michael Busch and Nico Hoerner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s such a talented hitter,” left fielder Ian Happ said. “His swing is beautiful, but his ability to just impact the baseball is really special. That’s in there, and it’s in there all the time. . . . He’s a huge force for us in the lineup.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2023/2/28/23619152/cubs-seiya-suzuki-diagnosed-with-moderate-oblique-strain-opening-day-wbc-team-japan\"   &gt;After missing the 2023 WBC&lt;/a&gt; with an oblique injury, he’s now set to enter the regular season riding the momentum of a WBC run for the first time. Team Japan, the reigning champion, is expected to go far. That’s not guaranteed to kick-start Suzuki’s season with the Cubs, but he showed in the playoffs last year that he has a knack for rising to the occasion in these sorts of settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just fun being in that mode,” manager Craig Counsell said. “That’s why WBC is so attractive. October is like, ‘Just give me more’ — that’s what everybody feels when you go through it. So that’s why the guys love the WBC, because it gives them that if you can get to the right games.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Suzuki’s usual position is right field, he confirmed he’ll slide over to center for Team Japan. In preparation, he’s set to play center for the Cubs on Friday and Sunday as they open Cactus League play. He leaves Monday to join his national team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No worries there,” Suzuki said. “I feel like I’ve been moving well. That’s something I worked on in the offseason. And getting those reps in, I think that’s going to be beneficial for me in the season, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grinning, he added: “If Pete wants an off day or something, that’s my chance to play center field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, items=[{type=Image, category=[{items=[MLB]}], _styledTemplate=null, description=[{items=[Clark stepped down after an internal investigation into an “inappropriate” relationship with his sister-in-law, who had been hired by the union in 2023, according to an ESPN report.]}], imageAlignment=null, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb, isFeatured=false, wordCount=173, authors=[{bio=[{items=[USA Today is a multi-platform news and information media company that prints across the United States and internationally.

I have had many relationships (some good, some bad). Although in the past I experienced heartbreaks, I am now open to meeting someone new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently ended a relationship with \"Bill,\" a man I met at a resort casino three years ago. I was happy in the beginning, until things started to take a turn. Because we go to the same places all the time, it was hard to break it off. I tried, but Bill would run back to me, and I always took him back, mostly because I felt guilty for hurting him. I finally ended things for good four months ago, after he did something very rude. A neighbor later told me that Bill was stalking me. Bill denies this, even though I have proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby, I am writing because, for some reason, I'm still drawn to him. He's the only man in my life who ever told me he loves me. I'm afraid no one will ever love me the way he does. I know the stalking is a sign that he is mentally unwell, yet we keep bumping into each other, which has caused this pull to want to be with him. I can't afford therapy right now, so any advice you can give me to move beyond this \"pull\" I have for him would be appreciated. — &lt;i&gt;HEART RULING THE HEAD&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR HEART:&lt;/b&gt; Honey, if you no longer frequent the places you used to frequent together and keep running into him anyway, has it occurred to you that it's happening BECAUSE HE'S STILL STALKING YOU? If you're still going to the same places, it's time to change your routine. This troubled individual may be the only person who has said \"I love you,\" but he won't be the last if you open yourself to other relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You say you can't afford therapy, but please be aware that free or low-cost counseling is available from your county's department of mental health services or a local college or university with a psychology department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; I've been talking to a famous pro wrestler who is having marriage problems. He has been hitting on me through Google Chat. I just want to be a supportive friend whom he can vent to. He says his wife \"is getting too old for him,\" if you know what I mean. They have a joint bank account, but he says it's frozen. He has asked me for an Apple card. I told him no and to ask his extended family instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby, I need my money to help out my brothers and sister. I'd prefer he be like a friend or big brother to me. I need major advice, please, because it feels like my life is going out of control. — &lt;i&gt;UNCERTAIN IN IDAHO&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR UNCERTAIN:&lt;/b&gt; People must exercise caution when communicating with strangers online. \"Famous pro wrestlers\" usually have enough money that they aren't reduced to hitting up women they meet on the internet for Apple cards. Your life will not \"go out of control\" unless you allow it to. Regain control by ghosting and blocking this person. He's a scammer, and he, not you, should figure out his own financial problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

The administration’s decision equates to deliberately harming Americans by intentionally exposing people to known toxins. I am outraged at the wanton disregard for the scientific and medical knowledge that enables the advancement of society and allows people to live longer and better lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our hospitals and clinics, we see the consequences of poor air quality, extreme heat and severe weather events every day. There is a mental toll that we all suffer when dealing with loss from a flood or caring for a child who develops asthma. And these are just a few examples of the known consequences of ignoring decades of science and medical evidence showing that greenhouse gas pollution is a danger to our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Illinois alone, this decision could amount to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://library.edf.org/AssetLink/8185q63d8o5k72s2665rx4jtd1nfxb37.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;$29 billion dollars&lt;/a&gt; in health harms in the next 30 years, according to an analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund. Illinoisans stand to suffer some of the greatest health harms being one of the five of the most impacted states. This will mean premature deaths, asthma attacks, emergency room and hospital admissions and lost days of school and work. For the United States, the human toll could reach up to $500 billion. This is not the kind of legacy that leads to greatness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decision prioritizes industry profits over the health of the American people. Our patients, families, and communities are paying the cost while polluters are shielded from accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a doctor, it is my job to let patients know when something is harmful to their health. The repeal of the endangerment finding is a great harm to our health. Our leaders, this administration, and polluters should be held accountable.

This is a common misperception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal program does not take money away from public schools, but is in addition to Title I and other federal programs. While many public school advocates oppose this type of federal legislation, the plain fact of the matter is that it exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Gov. JB Pritzker does not endorse the federal tax-credit scholarship program, it only means that Illinois children and parents will lose millions of dollars in educational aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a fundamental misunderstanding of the economic impact and the tax burden of parents sending children to private schools that should be understood. The existence of private schools actually permits higher levels of public school funding on a per-student basis than would be sustainable without them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every parent of a private school child is, in effect, subsidizing the public school system and the taxpayers of Illinois, not the reverse. Each parent of a private school child provides the same funding to the public school system as does a parent of a child in the public school system but, in addition, pays tuition on top of that for the private school system, thus not burdening public schools with the expense of educating their child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chicago Public Schools, the operating expense per student per year is over $20,000 and the total expense is almost $30,000. Consequently, private school parents save taxpayers millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the private school system in Chicago were to shut down, it would cause about a billion dollars additional cost to the taxpayers of Chicago to absorb the private school population, without any additional revenue from real estate taxes and would almost certainly necessitate a significant increase in tax rates. Given the already tenuous financial position and the ongoing closure of private schools, public policy should encourage Illinois government to make the most of every opportunity to bring in new federal dollars to keep private schools open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker’s responsibility is to all citizens of Illinois, both those who favor public schools and those who enroll their children in private schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charles W.

I learned this as a Chicago police officer, and I teach it now as a criminal justice professor: Trust takes decades to build and moments to destroy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents stand where local police departments stood decades ago. They can learn from our mistakes or repeat them on a national scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning signs are flashing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Halloween festivities last fall, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/26/northwest-side-ice-arrests-tear-gas\"   &gt;federal agents deployed tear gas&lt;/a&gt; before a party in Chicago's Old Irving Park neighborhood, forcing the cancellation of a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/28/after-halloween-parade-ruined-by-federal-agents-old-irving-park-neighbors-furious/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;children’s Halloween parade&lt;/a&gt;.

American citizens felt they needed protected zones for their children because they feared federal law enforcement operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-990000\" name=\"module-990000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Commentary bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commentary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When 33rd Ward Ald. Rossana Rodriguez Sanchez checked on her constituents, witnesses reported &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://abc7chicago.com/post/ice-chicago-news-federal-agents-detain-people-irving-park-albany-push-ald-rossana-rodriguez-sanchez-halloween-2025/18096451/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;agents pushing her&lt;/a&gt;. In Evanston, federal agents allegedly caused &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://abc7chicago.com/post/ice-evanston-today-news-cook-county-officials-speak-federal-immigration-agents-reportedly-area-halloween/18095995/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;a crash near an elementary school&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this brings to mind rogue tactics of the past deployed by police departments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In New York City, stop-and-frisk policies saw police stopping nearly &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/fact-sheet-stop-and-frisks-effect-crime-new-york-city\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;700,000 people in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/data/stop-and-frisk-data\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;88% resulting in no arrest&lt;/a&gt;.  The policy was eventually ruled &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://eji.org/news/new-york-crime-falls-as-police-end-stop-and-frisk/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;, but a generation of young men grew up viewing every police interaction with suspicion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, former Police Commander &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicagotorturejustice.org/history\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Jon Burge&lt;/a&gt; and officers under his command tortured more than 100 suspects between 1972 and 1991. Children who watched their fathers handcuffed grew into adults who won't call 911 when they hear gunshots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those heinous acts cast a shadow over legitimate police work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once arrested a domestic batterer who became verbally aggressive. His young son watched as I handcuffed his father. That little boy looked at me and said, \"When I grow up, I'm going to kill you for locking up my father.\" This was a necessary arrest, but that child only understood that a man with a badge took his father away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a legitimate arrest can create that resentment, imagine the impact when families are separated during a children's holiday. These children will remember the Halloween when federal agents made their parents too afraid to let them trick-or-treat. That's how generational distrust is built; one traumatic memory at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My students from Chicago neighborhoods describe what this looks like. One reports hearing constant helicopter surveillance. Another student, born in Syria, shared something troubling: the atmosphere reminds him of the fear he experienced back home — helicopters, uncertainty, the sense that violence could erupt at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a young man who fled a war zone says federal operations in Chicago feel similar to what he escaped, every federal law enforcement professional should pause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Enforce laws professionally&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICE and Border Patrol have legitimate mandates to enforce immigration law. The question isn't whether they should enforce the law; they absolutely should. The question is whether they'll learn from local law enforcement's mistakes about how enforcement is conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can arrest someone without traumatizing their children. You can execute a warrant without turning a neighborhood into a war zone. Professional law enforcement transcends politics because the principles of proportional force, constitutional rights and community trust aren't partisan issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When federal agents deployed tear gas during Halloween weekend and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem rejected Gov. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/29/gov-pritzker-letter-kristi-noem-ice-enforcement-pause-chicago-halloween\"   &gt;JB Pritzker’s request &lt;/a&gt;to pause enforcement operations around schools during the holiday, they sent a clear message about priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal immigration enforcement agencies don't have to repeat police departments' mistakes. Police departments that rebuilt trust did so by fundamentally changing their approach, training officers in de-escalation, emphasizing procedural justice and holding officers accountable when they crossed lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child who watches a harsh immigration enforcement operation today will be a voting adult in a few years and a parent in a decade. The lessons children learn now about whether law enforcement treats people with dignity will shape their attitudes toward all authority figures for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It goes back to communities having long memories. Local police learned this lesson the hard way, spending decades trying to rebuild trust. Federal immigration enforcement doesn't have to make the same mistakes, but they have to be willing to listen to those of us who've lived through the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Louis Martinez is a professor of law enforcement at Oakton College's Des Plaines campus and a former Chicago police officer. He has written about law enforcement issues for nearly two decades.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-820000\" name=\"module-820000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

There’s these Chinese red lanterns hanging in there with a bunch of my grandparents’ furniture that I revamped to fit the space. It has a Shanghai kind of vibe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diners might remember it as The Ladies’ Room, formerly owned by the Fat Rice team of which Lo was a part.

Its footprint is tiny and diners will be seated at tables of two and four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re offering a tasting menu that represents prosperity, wealth, good fortune and long life as we head into the new lunar cycle,” said Lo. “We’ll have dumplings, which are associated with wealth due to their shape as a money bag. Spring rolls symbolize gold bars. Long noodles signify long life, so that’s where the stir-fried noodles come in. These are dishes you traditionally see on Lunar New Year menus. &lt;i&gt;Yusheng, &lt;/i&gt;also known as the ‘prosperity’ salad, will also be served.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dish is made of shaved vegetables, sometimes slivers of seafood are included (not for the dinner at Third Bird) and topped with slices of citrus fruits like oranges. The bright, seasonal fruit is a sign of good luck and is synonymous with the holiday. Guests dining at Lo’s restaurant will be asked to dress the plated salad and toss the ingredients together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The belief is, the higher you toss it, the more prosperous a year it will be,” Lo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialty menu, in celebration of the Year of the Horse, is available for two nights only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lo points out how she has done specialty Lunar New Year events throughout the years but after exploring who she is and growing into her career, this dinner might be one of the most meaningful yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being Chinese American, as a younger kid, [my culture] wasn’t something I was really into. As I've gotten older, that’s changed. It's been really exciting. I love who I am, where I came from, who my grandparents are and what we're about.

Montgomery, the city of Chicago’s first Black corporation counsel, was presented Tuesday with his ancestral roots by Henry Louis Gates Jr., host of PBS’ “Finding Your Roots.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a 94th birthday present, Gates gifted Montgomery his “Book of Life,” a detailed account of Montgomery’s lineage on both sides of his family back to his third great-grandparents. The work was prepared by American Ancestors, a family history nonprofit based in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was more than I knew,” Montgomery said. “You know, I’ve learned that these people were industrious and landowners. And that gives me a sense of self-esteem and pride.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reveal was hosted Tuesday by Trinity United Church of Christ, where Montgomery is a charter member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery was born in Louise, Mississippi, and thought that was as far as his roots went. But he learned that his ancestors have origins on plantations in Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an 1844 probate record document, it was determined Montgomery’s paternal third great-grandmother, Rosetta Guster, who was born in1807, his paternal second great-grandmother, Luvinia Guster, who was born in 1825, and three other relatives were recorded as property of George Fisher in Yazoo County, Mississippi. The record detailed what was to happen to his property after his death, which in this case, Montgomery's ancestors were guaranteed to Burwell Boykin, a prosperous slave owner with plantations across the South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates surmised that the agreement between Fisher and Boykin could stem from a few possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fisher may have owed Boykin a debt, and they were property, and your ancestors were used to repay that debt,” Gates said. “It’s also possible that Boykin had loaned or leased your ancestors to Fisher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates went on to ask Montgomery how it felt to know that his flesh and blood were \"passed around between two white slave owners, like farm animals, or farm equipment?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without hesitation, Montgomery responded: “Angry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Finding Your Roots” host took Montgomery through the same process he’s done with celebrities on television. Asking them questions about their skills and talents to possibly trace those same skills and talents back to their ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After coming to Chicago in 1937, Montgomery enrolled in Fuller Elementary and then went on to Phillips High School. Montgomery said his white guidance counselor attempted to dissuade him from going to college, suggesting that it would be too difficult. He went on to earn his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Highlights of his law career include: becoming the first African American to serve as the city’s top lawyer, under Mayor Harold Washington; filing a class-action lawsuit against the Chicago Board Education, in 1961, claiming that the board deliberately created segregated schools; and serving as the attorney of record for Fred Hampton, the activist and leader of the Illinois chapter of the national Black Panther Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates said that Montgomery could trace the origins of his successful career to the entrepreneurial spirit of his ancestors. In Montgomery’s “Book of Life,” Gates included loan agreements between his ancestors and the Lintonia Building and Loan Association, where his maternal second great-grandparents, Alex and Patsy Oliver, took out a $600 loan and $200 worth of supplies, and put up 50 acres of their land as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That Alex and Patsy, by 1899, already owned land, let me tell you this: This would have been, that was huge,” Gates said. “That was very rare for Black people to own land, particularly in Mississippi.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery said his family still owns that land of 200 acres, and that once a year, he and his family members get between $10 and $50 for leasing the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was only a partial ancestral reveal due to time constraints. Montgomery will have to take a DNA test to determine his genealogy that will detail the percentage of his sub-Saharan African Black, European, white and Native American ancestry. Tuesday’s presentation will not be part of the PBS “Finding Your Roots” show, but can be seen on Trinity’s Facebook page and YouTube channel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

of regional Sistema orchestras around Venezuela. Guerrero, then in his 20s, was appointed to lead one of those orchestras, in the western state of Táchira — his first professional conducting job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I owe basically my career to El Sistema and Venezuela,” Guerrero, 56, told WBEZ in a recent phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-960000\" name=\"image-960000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f59eafc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+378/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5f%2F8d%2F00b690e7433484ca2eec11d0b26f%2Fconcierto-de-otono-featuring-venezuelan-trumpet-virtuoso-pacho-flores-photo-credit-grant-park-music-festival-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c4d300/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+378/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5f%2F8d%2F00b690e7433484ca2eec11d0b26f%2Fconcierto-de-otono-featuring-venezuelan-trumpet-virtuoso-pacho-flores-photo-credit-grant-park-music-festival-1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d2b9d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+378/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5f%2F8d%2F00b690e7433484ca2eec11d0b26f%2Fconcierto-de-otono-featuring-venezuelan-trumpet-virtuoso-pacho-flores-photo-credit-grant-park-music-festival-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Concierto de Otoño featuring Venezuelan trumpet virtuoso Pacho Flores\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d2b9d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+378/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5f%2F8d%2F00b690e7433484ca2eec11d0b26f%2Fconcierto-de-otono-featuring-venezuelan-trumpet-virtuoso-pacho-flores-photo-credit-grant-park-music-festival-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a1aa59/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+378/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5f%2F8d%2F00b690e7433484ca2eec11d0b26f%2Fconcierto-de-otono-featuring-venezuelan-trumpet-virtuoso-pacho-flores-photo-credit-grant-park-music-festival-1.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d2b9d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+378/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5f%2F8d%2F00b690e7433484ca2eec11d0b26f%2Fconcierto-de-otono-featuring-venezuelan-trumpet-virtuoso-pacho-flores-photo-credit-grant-park-music-festival-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Pacho Flores (left) became an international soloist, and Giancarlo Guerrero (right) famous enough to score a cameo appearance in Bad Bunny’s halftime show, both men passed through the same organization: El Sistema Nacional de Orquestas y Coros Juveniles e Infantiles de Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Grant Park Music Festival&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Sistema was founded in 1975 by economist&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and conductor José Antonio Abreu, a former cultural minister who used his political clout to turn El Sistema into a state-run program. The country’s oil boom fueled El Sistema’s rapid growth, organized into so-called &lt;i&gt;núcleos &lt;/i&gt;— like the one Guerrero led, in Táchira —&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;across all 23&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;states in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its top orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra, first became a global sensation after &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8wS-1Eqonk\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a high-octane performance at the 2007 BBC Proms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, donning windbreakers emblazoned with the Venezuelan flag. More recently, the orchestra opened for Coldplay during its 10 sold-out concerts at Wembley Stadium last summer, with frontman Chris Martin &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW29-Tgwcz4&amp;amp;list=RDGW29-Tgwcz4&amp;amp;start_radio=1\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;hailing it onstage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as “maybe the best orchestra in the whole world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, El Sistema alums are conspicuously well-represented in classical music institutions and conservatories everywhere. This fall, Venezuela-born conductor Gustavo Dudamel, 45, will take the reins of America’s most visible classical music post, the New York Philharmonic, while still acting as music director of the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra. Fellow conductor Rafael Payare, who participated in El Sistema at the same time as Dudamel, leads the San Diego and Montréal symphonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Venezuelan musicians are members of some of the world’s best orchestras, from the Berlin Philharmonic to our own Chicago Symphony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People talk about oil, especially nowadays in Venezuela,”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Guerrero said. “Honestly, it is professional classical music which may be the biggest export for that country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-4d0000\" name=\"image-4d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7ef5e72/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bcc5b41/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6e19f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Giancarlo Guerrero, artistic director and principal conductor of Chicago&amp;#x27;s Grant Park Music Festival.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6e19f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c5ac3a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6e19f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I owe basically my career to El Sistema and Venezuela,” Giancarlo Guerrero, artistic director and principal conductor of Chicago’s Grant Park Music Festival, told WBEZ in a recent phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victor Hilitski for the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid a flashpoint in U.S.-Venezuela relations and ramped up domestic immigration enforcement, the future of that export has never been more in question.

Those exceptions were narrowed further &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/suspension-of-visa-issuance-to-foreign-nationals-to-protect-the-security-of-the-united-states.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;in January&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That spells uncertainty for Venezuelan musicians who might have otherwise moved to Chicago to pursue their career, whether at the city’s many top-tier conservatories or through early-career opportunities at the Chicago Symphony, Civic Orchestra of Chicago or Grant Park Music Festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have two [Venezuelan] students who want to come, who are really good, and I'd like them to come,”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;said Almita Vamos, a Chicago-based violin pedagogue whose prestigious studio attracts students from around the globe. “I don't know if they can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Play, sing and fight&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Sistema is a massive organization that defies easy definition. Its core operations pertain to its nationwide network of community music schools that offer extracurricular instruction to children free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it also encompasses several professional ensembles, all at the apex of their respective regional &lt;i&gt;núcleos.&lt;/i&gt; Accomplished students, no matter how young, can progress and join the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nicaraguan-born, Costa Rica–raised Guerrero says that kids as young as 12 and 13 years old played alongside veteran musicians in his professional orchestra in Táchira. Sometimes, members from various levels of the &lt;i&gt;núcleo&lt;/i&gt; play together for special events — a spectacle of orchestral performance that doubled as a learning experience for the younger musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’d be doing Beethoven symphonies with 400 players,” Guerrero recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in its earliest years, El Sistema’s focus on ensemble education — at first orchestral education, with choirs added later — set it apart from other free music programs. Founder José Antonio Abreu codified El Sistema’s mission as one of social uplift, drawing parallels between the collaborative nature of a musical ensemble and civic participation. More idealistically, El Sistema positions itself as a way for Venezuela to conquer growing poverty and gang violence — echoed in its mantra to “play, sing and fight” (“tocar, cantar y luchar”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The project was always seen as national development as opposed to cultural or artistic development,” says Norma Núñez-Ruch, operations manager of both the Loop venue &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/music/2024/10/17/guarneri-hall-performances-chicago-classical-music-venue\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Guarneri Hall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Segundo Ruiz Belvis Cultural Center in Hermosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Núñez-Ruch, 39, trained on the viola through El Sistema and held administrative jobs in the program for six years before working at some spinoff programs in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Simón Bolívar Orchestra, and by extension El Sistema, dazzled the world 20 years ago, copycat programs sprung up in under-resourced communities across the globe. Some of the most prominent examples in the United States include the Los Angeles Philharmonic’s Youth Orchestra Los Angeles (YOLA) and the Baltimore Symphony’s OrchKids program, a brainchild of Ravinia chief conductor Marin Alsop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locally, Ravinia’s Reach Teach Play programming also includes a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicagophilharmonic.org/national-seminario-ravinia-recap/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Sistema-inspired pillar for orchestral students&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as does &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://peoplesmusicschool.org/50years/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;the People’s Music School&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Uptown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-910000\" name=\"image-910000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff90fc4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5c%2F3f%2F2b8082114ac38a42ddec513f88e2%2Fraviniareno-080925-9.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2fb02e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5c%2F3f%2F2b8082114ac38a42ddec513f88e2%2Fraviniareno-080925-9.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24d53a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5c%2F3f%2F2b8082114ac38a42ddec513f88e2%2Fraviniareno-080925-9.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The Sandra K.

Musicians of any age can advance to its paid, professional-level orchestras, and, in many cases, children are paid enough to become the primary breadwinners for their family. That incentivizes students’ participation and progression in El Sistema, but also sometimes lends it a brutal competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have a very good friend who told me he was making more money at 20 than his father, who was an engineer,”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;says Ricardo Lorenz, a Venezuelan-born composer who now teaches at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenz and Núñez-Ruch both remember a time when those salaries were enough to keep musicians inside Venezuela. But when its economy collapsed in the 2010s&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; even well-heeled El Sistema no longer had the funds to retain musicians. A surge in musicians choosing to study and work abroad followed — and Venezuela’s loss became the world’s gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where music and politics collide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Sistema and Abreu himself have been the subjects of widespread criticism both within and outside Venezuela for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program was founded more than 20 years before the presidency of Hugo Chávez, whose populist ideology laid the groundwork for the more tight-fisted authoritarianism of his successor, Nicolás Maduro. But the degree to which El Sistema has been used as a propaganda tool by both regimes has led to accusations of political opportunism and “artwashing” — in other words, using culture to distract from a bleaker political reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan pianist Gabriela Montero, who regularly performs with world-class orchestras like the Chicago Symphony, is one such critic. She told The Times of London last year that “it is no longer morally acceptable to host orchestras owned and operated by rogue states as mechanisms of soft power and influence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many have petitioned Dudamel to take a similarly firm stance. Though the conductor &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2017/05/04/526897569/gustavo-dudamel-addresses-venezuelas-leaders-enough-is-enough\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;has criticized the Maduro regime in the past&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — most notably in 2017, when an El Sistema student was killed by soldiers during a protest — he remains music director of the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra, El Sistema’s most prestigious ensemble, and a champion for the organization at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f80000\" name=\"image-f80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b789b29/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a0dd07/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e460fea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The Chicago Symphony Orchestra rehearses Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 1 in G minor, Winter Daydreams (or Winter Dreams) Op. 13 in the Loop, Wednesday, April 17, 2024\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e460fea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7c34cce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e460fea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan musicians are members of some of the world’s best orchestras, from the Berlin Philharmonic to our own Chicago Symphony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she worked for El Sistema during the Chávez years, Núñez-Ruch notes that many within the organization were clear-eyed about Venezuela’s political realities. At the same time, El Sistema receives some 80% of its funding from the Venezuelan government, leaving the organization essentially stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my perception, [the attitude of El Sistema] was, ‘Say whatever you want to say as long as we can sustain the work.’ That's part of the political strategy of the organization and its leadership,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Venezuelan government’s dysfunction and strong-arming tendencies sometimes snowball into El Sistema itself. While living in Chicago in the early 2000s, Lorenz was helping spearhead a community program with the Chicago Symphony in Pilsen. Abreu pushed Lorenz to forge a connection between the CSO and El Sistema, which never materialized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Abreu, who was always “supportive” of Lorenz’s career, later reached out asking if Lorenz would be interested in returning to Venezuela. While Lorenz mulled the offer, Chávez named the composer to replace the current president of the Instituto Universitario De Estudios Musicales in Caracas via his weekly television program, “Aló Presidente.” Lorenz was shocked. He’d only been in early talks for the position, which he quickly declined. The episode effectively ended his relationship with Abreu. “He was very disappointed after that,” Lorenz recalls. (Abreu died in 2018.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, British scholar Geoffrey Baker has cast doubt on the idea that the program prioritizes social uplift at all. In the absence of demographic data, which El Sistema keeps private, his 2014 book “El Sistema: Orchestrating Venezuela's Youth”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;leaned on hundreds of interviews and a year observing El Sistema’s &lt;i&gt;núcleos&lt;/i&gt;. Baker’s findings indicated that the program served a core demographic of middle-to-upper-class children, with impoverished students in the minority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Baker observed that El Sistema’s “revolutionary” educational philosophy was, if anything, retrograde. &lt;i&gt;Núcleos&lt;/i&gt; more often resembled old-school European conservatoires where endless hours of practice were the norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I naively thought that when Abreu died and more musicians left the country, some would start speaking out about the problems,” Baker wrote to WBEZ via e-mail. “But I hadn't counted on the fact that El Sistema's good name was essential to their job prospects overseas — it was their meal ticket.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-af0000\" name=\"image-af0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04d6664/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9d80562/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bad3ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Protesters gather in Water Tower Park downtown to denounce the arrest of Venezuela’s President Maduro and the ICE-involved killings of Renee Nicole Good and Silverio Villegas González as part of a national day of action, Saturday, Jan. 10, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bad3ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e0fe5f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bad3ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters gather in Water Tower Park in Downtown Chicago in January 2026 to denounce the arrest of Venezuela’s President Maduro.

But she does feel as though El Sistema was operating with more political deftness than it is often given credit for. She points to El Sistema’s use of broadly Venezuelan symbolism on its tours rather than the United Socialist Party’s logo, at a time when that imagery was ubiquitous inside Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Managing that is not a small feat,” Núñez-Ruch said of the organization’s ability to detach itself from Chávez-related iconography. “It’s something that is very herculean, and only in hindsight, and outside of the country, can I see how masterful it was not to cross that line.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenz likewise “owes a debt of gratitude” to El Sistema, he wrote via e-mail, despite his own mixed feelings. Next month, Dudamel will conduct a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.laphil.com/musicdb/pieces/7415/humboldts-nature\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;new work&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Lorenz’s to commemorate his final season with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which he has led since 2009. The piece is inspired by Venezuela’s landscape: the rugged eastern coast, birds twittering in the six-mile-long Guácharo Cave, and drumbeats ringing over Lake Tacarigua, to the north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sad part of all these things that have happened in the past month is that it’s trying to bring us back 100 years, where the only thing that Venezuela has is oil,” Lorenz says. “I thought we were beyond that.”&lt;/p&gt;",

They were looking for a few good Catholic girls — to work at the FBI. One of the students at the school that day, Patricia DePasquale, talked years later about these FBI recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Working for the FBI, getting this job after high school, it gave her the independence and freedom that I think she wanted,” said DePasquale’s daughter Carmie Callobre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callobre, who lives in Skokie, said that back in the 1940s, her mother jumped at the opportunity to work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. For the next several years, DePasquale was a switchboard operator for the FBI’s Chicago office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d10000\" name=\"image-d10000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff32c2f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1912x1073+0+819/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2F02%2F466387df48c492f05a66c2bb0f11%2Funnamed-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a793549/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1912x1073+0+819/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2F02%2F466387df48c492f05a66c2bb0f11%2Funnamed-2.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72e7942/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1912x1073+0+819/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2F02%2F466387df48c492f05a66c2bb0f11%2Funnamed-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Patricia DePasquale\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72e7942/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1912x1073+0+819/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2F02%2F466387df48c492f05a66c2bb0f11%2Funnamed-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4dcdacf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1912x1073+0+819/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2F02%2F466387df48c492f05a66c2bb0f11%2Funnamed-2.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72e7942/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1912x1073+0+819/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2F02%2F466387df48c492f05a66c2bb0f11%2Funnamed-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patricia DePasquale was a student at Notre Dame High School for Girls when the FBI hired her to work as a switchboard operator in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Carmie Callobre&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She even dated some FBI agents. “Mom was gorgeous when she was young, and she dated a lot of people,” Callobre said. “And she definitely did date FBI agents. They would just take her anywhere downtown. She would go to, probably, the Berghoff. Definitely Italian Village.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePasquale eventually left the FBI and started working at a law firm. The man she eventually fell in love with and married — Callobre’s father, Edmund Daugird — was the manager of a bar in Rosemont. DePasquale, who died in 2024, later worked at restaurants, catering businesses and a corporate cafeteria. Years later, Callobre wondered how common it was for the FBI to recruit girls from Catholic schools in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was flabbergasted the first time … she told us about that,” Callobre said. “I thought, ‘Well, that’s odd.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In more recent decades, the FBI has become known for its competitive hiring process. But there is an extensive history of the agency recruiting high school girls to work office jobs in an earlier era. How much of that initiative focused on Chicago and Catholic schools? The FBI did not answer requests for information for this story, but historians and former high school recruits cast light on those hiring practices, which eventually set the stage for women to become FBI special agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt; ‘Catholic girls would fit in’ at the FBI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as Pat DePasquale’s life diverged from the FBI, she kept in touch with her former co-workers at the bureau, maintaining those ties by joining the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://thefbialumni.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Society of FBI Alumni&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It started as a group of ladies who went to lunch and just wanted to keep their FBI connection and their friendships together,” said Western Springs resident Jane McCarty, who was the Society of FBI Alumni’s president until November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formally organized in 1973, the alumni group began inviting men to join in 1979, but most of the members are still women. “We have agents in our group, but predominantly we’re support staff — intelligence analysts, IT people, typists, the clerical staff,” McCarty said. The national organization has a chapter in Chicago with 120 members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a80000\" name=\"image-a80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/763f7b7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5599x3142+0+667/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2c%2F0f%2F135917634cb6892af148429a0c3d%2F1948studentsfrontdoors.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f9a67da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5599x3142+0+667/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2c%2F0f%2F135917634cb6892af148429a0c3d%2F1948studentsfrontdoors.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7ebd23e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5599x3142+0+667/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2c%2F0f%2F135917634cb6892af148429a0c3d%2F1948studentsfrontdoors.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"1948StudentsFrontDoors.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7ebd23e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5599x3142+0+667/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2c%2F0f%2F135917634cb6892af148429a0c3d%2F1948studentsfrontdoors.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4cfc751/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5599x3142+0+667/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2c%2F0f%2F135917634cb6892af148429a0c3d%2F1948studentsfrontdoors.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7ebd23e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5599x3142+0+667/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2c%2F0f%2F135917634cb6892af148429a0c3d%2F1948studentsfrontdoors.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students stand at the door of Notre Dame High School for Girls in Chicago, Illinois in 1948.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;SNDdeN Virtual Archives&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCarty said the FBI regularly sent recruiters to high schools all over the country, and not just Catholic schools. Even now, the FBI has &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/outreach\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Teen Academy and Youth Academy programs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which “allow high school and middle school students an opportunity to get a comprehensive look into today’s FBI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When McCarty was a student at a public high school in California in 1968, FBI recruiters showed up there. A month after McCarty graduated, she started working for the FBI as a stenographer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today, I probably could not get my job, because you need a college degree,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This recruiting tactic was not targeted at Catholic school girls exclusively. But when McCarty transferred to the FBI’s Chicago office in 1979, she did notice a number of the local employees were from Notre Dame High School for Girls. (Located at 3000 N. Mango Ave. in the Belmont Central neighborhood, the school closed in 2016.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those Catholic girls would fit in because, you know, you had to have a certain-length skirt,” McCarty said. “The rules were the rules. I mean, we couldn’t wear pants until ’72. There were so many rules like that, it would be like a Catholic school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones, author of the 2007 book &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300142846/the-fbi/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;The FBI: A History&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, said a strategy of hiring Catholic girls would line up perfectly with longtime FBI Director J.

He went out of his way to praise the Catholic schools in America. He explicitly said that these schools have amongst their teaching staff not a single example of an atheist. And of course, communism, amongst other things, stands for atheism. That was his outlook.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoover did send FBI agents to recruit young women from Catholic schools on the East Coast; Jeffreys-Jones said he’d be surprised if Hoover didn’t do the same thing in Chicago, a city still heavily influenced by its Catholic culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During World War II, the FBI had vastly expanded the number of women on its payroll. In addition to working as secretaries, stenographers and switchboard operators, women began to take on more skilled activities, such as statistical analysis and code-breaking. “However, they still weren’t permitted to become the elite special agents,” Jeffreys-Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoover’s sexism was a major obstacle to that sort of reform, although as Jeffreys-Jones noted, women faced similar prejudice throughout the world of law enforcement. “I think it is frustrating for women to serve only in the lower ranks of an agency like the FBI, and we do have proof definitive that women can make very good detectives,” he said. (As evidence, Jeffreys-Jones pointed to 19th-century Chicago sleuth Kate Warne, whom he wrote about in his 2025 book&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://press.georgetown.edu/Book/Allan-Pinkerton\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Allan Pinkerton: America’s Legendary Detective and the Birth of Private Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moving up the ranks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1971, 16-year-old Nancy McRae wrote a letter to Hoover saying she hoped to become a special agent. Hoover wrote back: “Because of the nature of the duties our Special Agents are called upon to perform, we do not employ women in that position. We must have Agents who are qualified to cope with any situation they may face.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoover died in 1972, ending his 48-year reign as the director of the FBI and its precursor agency, the Bureau of Investigation. Just two months after his death, the FBI finally allowed women to become special agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I know, what all of you know, and what Hoover either did not know or did not acknowledge, is that women are absolutely essential to effective law enforcement,” then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches-and-testimony/director-wrays-remarks-at-the-women-in-federal-law-enforcement-annual-leadership-training\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;2024 speech&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the group Women in Federal Law Enforcement. At the time he spoke, 24% of FBI special agents — and 37% of agent trainees — were women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a20000\" name=\"image-a20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/21c03f8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F65%2F8e06fa3c4f2d90b3230262ff6383%2Ffbi-111319.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a7ef6b5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F65%2F8e06fa3c4f2d90b3230262ff6383%2Ffbi-111319.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/daefcd8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F65%2F8e06fa3c4f2d90b3230262ff6383%2Ffbi-111319.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"FBI-111319\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/daefcd8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F65%2F8e06fa3c4f2d90b3230262ff6383%2Ffbi-111319.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d13c39c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F65%2F8e06fa3c4f2d90b3230262ff6383%2Ffbi-111319.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/daefcd8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F65%2F8e06fa3c4f2d90b3230262ff6383%2Ffbi-111319.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Seal of the FBI at the Chicago office of the FBI in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Foster/Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wray resigned in January 2025 as Donald Trump returned to the presidency, setting the stage for Trump to appoint Kash Patel as FBI director.

George Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Jane McCarty began working for the FBI during Hoover’s reign, she said she didn’t experience much discrimination. She eventually worked her way up through the ranks to become an asset forfeiture investigator. “Somebody took a chance on me,” she said. “Somebody said, ‘I think she could do the job.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callobre said her mom spoke nostalgically of her time as an FBI employee — and McCarty said that attitude is common among the Society of FBI Alumni’s members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still have the FBI in our heart,” McCarty said. “We all have very fond memories of our work there, and are very proud.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Robert Loerzel is a journalist based in Chicago.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-bf0000\" name=\"module-bf0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More about our question-asker&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-8b0000\" name=\"image-8b0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1f5e737/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1740x977+0+672/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F47%2Feea3ebc64445a8f266ec5c0cd224%2F1000001138.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/be3263e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1740x977+0+672/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F47%2Feea3ebc64445a8f266ec5c0cd224%2F1000001138.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2b06ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1740x977+0+672/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F47%2Feea3ebc64445a8f266ec5c0cd224%2F1000001138.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Carmie Callobre\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2b06ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1740x977+0+672/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F47%2Feea3ebc64445a8f266ec5c0cd224%2F1000001138.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3d6b55f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1740x977+0+672/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F47%2Feea3ebc64445a8f266ec5c0cd224%2F1000001138.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2b06ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1740x977+0+672/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F47%2Feea3ebc64445a8f266ec5c0cd224%2F1000001138.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Carmie Callobre&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;After growing up on Chicago’s Northwest Side and in Niles, Carmie Callobre studied theology at Loyola University. Now a longtime Skokie resident, she worked as an administrative assistant at various businesses before retiring in 2013.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the next dozen years, she often visited her mother, whose married name at the end of her life was Pat Daugird-Ehlen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“She had short-term memory loss, but she was doing OK,” Carmie said, noting that her mom was known for her sense of humor. She recalled a doctor visiting her mom in early 2024: “He said, ‘Do you know what day it is?’ And she said, ‘It’s my birthday.’ He said, ‘Do you know how old you are?’ And she said, ‘I was born in 1929. You do the math.’”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although Carmie had countless conversations with her mom, she said her mom never did tell her very much about what it was like working for the FBI. That was one topic about which she was “very tight-lipped.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-750000\" name=\"html-embed-module-750000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=\"https://modules.wearehearken.com/wbez/embed/4190.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Jesse Jackson appears with a large group of young children, representing virtually every color and ethnic group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his Afro in full bloom, Jackson takes his youthful rainbow coalition through a call-and-response recitation of the Rev. William Borders poem that Jackson made internationally known: \"I Am Somebody.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zuZV7ES4VE8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Jesse Jackson &amp;#39;I Am Somebody&amp;#39; on Sesame Street\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBS, which broadcast \"Sesame Street,\" was still in its infancy. The landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 was as recent then as, say, the COVID-19 crisis is now. And 30-year-old Jackson was at the start of a quarter-century run as a cultural presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson's decades civil rights efforts and running for president in 1984 and 1988 are his most important and lasting work. But that he did this while also forging a position in the nation's pop cultural firmament is nonetheless remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could be inspirational, as he was on \"Sesame Street\" and during a 1989 appearance on the sitcom &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://youtu.be/KUDQhdKxjH8?si=xCHW2WvVfPZTz8b0\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“A Different World,”&lt;/a&gt; talking about the role of young people in elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jackson could also be quite funny, as evidenced by the straight-faced delivery of Dr. Suess' \"Green Eggs and Ham\" on Saturday Night Live in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He understood media,\" Charles Whitaker, dean of Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. said. \"He understood the relevance of being able to engage with audiences. The combination of politician and preacher just made him a magnetic force.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A1mqg4C0awA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Green Eggs and Ham narrated by the Reverend Jesse Jackson\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Behind the camera&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linking Black entertainers to the civil/political/economics rights movement was also important to Jackson. He was a producer of Wattstax, the 1972 benefit concert by Stax Records to mark the seventh anniversary of the Watts riots in Los Angeles. The event became a double album and a concert film in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isaac Hayes, the Staple Singers, the Emotions, the Bar-Kays and comedian Richard Pryor were among the performers who got-down at Wattstax. But so did Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is a beautiful day,\" Jackson told the LA Memorial Coliseum audience in his opening speech. \"It is a new day. It is a day of Black awareness. It is a day of Black people taking care of Black people’s business. We are together, we are unified and all in accord. Because when we are together we got power. And we can make decisions.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in 1972 at the International Amphitheatre at 42nd and Halsted streets, Jackson pulled off a similar effort: Save the Children, a benefit concert for his Operation PUSH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line up included Marvin Gaye, the Jackson Five, the Temptations, Roberta Flack, Curtis Mayfield, Bill Withers and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-4b0000\" name=\"image-4b0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0367f7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+2/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F3f%2Ff0a1bd474f98a2f0ac825b340ab0%2Fjackson5-1-1-47.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7b35a2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+2/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F3f%2Ff0a1bd474f98a2f0ac825b340ab0%2Fjackson5-1-1-47.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/353d38e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+2/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F3f%2Ff0a1bd474f98a2f0ac825b340ab0%2Fjackson5-1-1-47.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The Jackson 5 perform during the 1972 Black Expo in Chicago.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/353d38e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+2/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F3f%2Ff0a1bd474f98a2f0ac825b340ab0%2Fjackson5-1-1-47.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/27020ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+2/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F3f%2Ff0a1bd474f98a2f0ac825b340ab0%2Fjackson5-1-1-47.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/353d38e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+2/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F3f%2Ff0a1bd474f98a2f0ac825b340ab0%2Fjackson5-1-1-47.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jackson 5 perform during the 1972 Black Expo in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Save the Children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The homegrown Chi-Lites performed, too.

He had been friends with Jackson since the 1960s. \"I mean, it was like magic.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson said Jackson encouraged the group to write their 1971 message song, \"(For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People.\" The lyrics almost read like an excerpt of Jackson's speeches:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't have enough to eat&lt;br&gt;How can you think of love?&lt;br&gt;You don't have the time to care&lt;br&gt;So it's crime you're guilty of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Save the Children benefit was turned into a concert film that had a short theatrical run then went unseen for 50 years. Directed by Stan Lathan — a director of \"Sesame Street\" episodes during Jackson's 1971 appearance — the film was digitally restored and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2024/10/18/save-the-children-chicago-jesse-jackson-stan-lathan-1972-black-expo-sammy-davis-jr\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;put back in circulation&lt;/a&gt; in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who’s got next?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his time in the cultural spotlight, Jackson was also parodied by Eddie Murphy on SNL and Keenan Ivory Wayans on the '90s FOX sketch show \"In Living Color.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He hosted SNL in 1984. He made political points in his opening monologue — and snuck some wisecracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I took [Fidel] Castro to church for the first time in 30 years,\" he said. \"If I coulda stayed [in Cuba] longer, I coulda actually got him a shave.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Being able to make fun of himself, I think made him more human,\" Jazz Institute of Chicago Executive Director Heather Ireland Robinson, who knows the Jackson family, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1990, Kris Kristofferson wrote a song called \"Jesse Jackson\" and sang it with Willie Nelson. The pair sang: \"Hold on brother, Jesse Jackson. There's a better world a'coming. Where a man can hope a man will show some heart. You just keep right on believing. In the better side of human. They ain't ready for it yet, but it's a start. And you move'em when you hit'em in the heart.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's cultural and media landscape is as fragmented as it is ever-present. Can a civil rights leader today have the same impact as did Jackson? Likely not, Whitaker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We don't see anyone breaking through quite like in the way that Jesse Jackson did,\" he said. \"Even a Barack Obama, who's a phenomenon and a wonder in his own right, has not used that platform in the same way as Jesse Jackson.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/obituaries/2026/02/17/rev-jesse-jackson-civil-rights-leader-rainbow-push-obituary\"   &gt;Rev.

They allow a food-minded public to restaurant-shop — and for&amp;nbsp;restaurateurs, they're a lower-risk entry point to test if a concept has legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pandemic impact&lt;/b&gt;: Many in the food industry point to COVID-19. When Time Out Market in Fulton Market closed last month, owners cited the pandemic's impact on office occupancy due to more people working from home. Time Out's vendors reportedly also noted its lack of investment in drawing customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benefits remain&lt;/b&gt;: Downtown foot traffic and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrlkly-l-d/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;office tenancy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are reportedly creeping back up, and workers want compelling, wallet-friendly lunch options. Such spaces also remain incubators for promising concepts. And they are getting more savvy about marketing themselves to tourists, who appreciate local options close to the sights without the hassle of booking tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Still serving&lt;/b&gt;: If you're looking to indulge in the concept, among the city's food halls still going strong are Sterling Food Hall, 125 S Clark St.; From Here On Food Hall in Market, 433 W Van Buren St.; and 88 Marketplace,&amp;nbsp;2105 S.

Jesse Jackson, 84. Flowers, a white balloon and a note to the Jackson family rested Tuesday morning on the pavement near the headquarters of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the nonprofit Jackson formed in 1970 that has spent decades working toward racial equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;His legacy&lt;/b&gt;: The Sun-Times and WBEZ spoke with community members, former colleagues, supporters, activists and Jackson's neighbors, who all reflected on their memories of the civil rights leader and the&amp;nbsp;impact he made. Regarded as Martin Luther King Jr.'s protege, Jackson worked throughout the Civil Rights movement and after to champion rights for Black people. In the 1980s, Jackson ran the first viable presidential campaign by a Black candidate in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key quote&lt;/b&gt;: \"He was courageous, and he had enough heart to challenge wrong,\" Gregory Sain, a community supporter, said of Jackson’s impact. \"We have to continue to motivate, inspire and raise up other individuals. Rev. Jackson will be a hero to many people.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More on Rev.

Jesse Jackson?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s some of what you said…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"As a Northwestern University undergraduate, I marched with Jesse Jackson in the streets of Chicago for civil rights. In 1968, we were tear-gassed by Richard J. Daley's cops — illegally. I also marched with him in anti-Vietnam War marches.\" —&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Harvey J. Graff&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"My husband and his friends frequented the Division Street Baths in the '70s thru the '90s. It was always a special occasion when 'The Reverend' and his entourage came into the steam room. Mr Jackson, like any good politician, would shake hands and introduce himself to everyone sitting on the tiled tiers. His charisma was contagious.\" —&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Sandy Doyle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"My special memory of Jesse Jackson happened Super Tuesday — Feb. 5, 2008. I was an Obama volunteer attending the party and broadcast of Barack Obama's speech at the Hyatt. Jesse Jackson was in the bleachers behind me doing live shots with reporters. After the cameras were locked on Barack, I noticed Jesse alone and holding an Obama sign. His mind and heart were elsewhere — perhaps pondering what 'could have been' for himself or one of his children. It was the tenderest moment of a politician, activist, human that I've seen up close and personal.\" —&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Doreen Rice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I had the honor to know and do some work with him, appearing on his radio show, receiving the Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon Johnson award from him, and assisting his organizations where I could. I have spent most of my life defending people facing the death penalty, work which Rev. Jackson supported. My memory is not just [his] amazing work ... It's of him sitting quietly with me at a table at the Illinois Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers dinner honoring his son, former Congressman Jackson. It's of him taking the time to speak with my then-teenage son, of his kind inquiries regarding my late husband's health, and his concern for humanity in general.\" —&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Andrea Lyon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have your own memories of Rev. Jackson?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrlkly-l-tu/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Share them here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading the Sun-Times&amp;nbsp;Morning Edition!&lt;br&gt;Got a story you think we missed?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:newsletters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Email us here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written and curated by&lt;/b&gt;: Matt Moore&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor&lt;/b&gt;: Eydie Cubarrubia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Chicago Sun-Times is a nonprofit supported by&amp;nbsp;readers like you.

JB Pritzker wants to implement a new tax on major social media companies like Facebook, X and TikTok to help balance a $56 billion state budget, as part of a state spending plan that also counts on additional tax revenue from casinos and large corporations, according to details released Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor’s latest budget proposal, the eighth of his tenure, doesn’t rock the boat much otherwise as Pritzker and Democrats who control the Illinois General Assembly emphasize cost-of-living concerns in a midterm election year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declaring it “a moment to stand up for Illinois and be loud for America,” Pritzker delivered his proposal with his annual State of the State address at the Capitol, a speech that officials said would outline an “affordability agenda” to help bring down costs for residents in terms of health care, housing, education and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the governor mulls a 2028 presidential run, he’s expected to highlight how Trump administration policies are raising such prices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his address, Pritzker was expected to outline his spring legislative agenda, which will include a push to cut red tape on local zoning laws to allow for more duplexes, granny flats and other housing. He was also set to advocate for a ban on cellphones for students in schools, along with a crackdown on junk fees on many online purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker’s budget team pointed to persistent threats of funding cuts under President Donald Trump’s administration as the impetus for what largely amounts to a maintenance budget at about $56 billion in spending, up about $878 million from the current budget year and landing at a projected surplus of $24 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Unlike the federal government, every year Illinois must balance its budget,\" Pritzker was set to say in prepared remarks. \"When Donald Trump is taking resources away that are rightfully ours, none of us — Democrats or Republicans — should be OK with that. So as we embark on this journey of maintaining our state’s now re-established record of fiscal responsibility, I want to say to anyone on either side of the aisle: if you want to talk about our FY2027 budget, you must first demand the return of the money and resources this president has taken from the people of Illinois.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor’s office had projected a $2.2 billion budget shortfall in October, now estimating $399 million in lost revenue next year due to congressional Republicans’ funding cuts for many social services and other federal programs, and the state assuming about $100 million in new administrative costs for food assistance and Medicaid programs. Meanwhile, the state is fighting in court to retain about $1 billion in various federal grants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker’s office is counting on about $4.1 billion in federal funds in the upcoming year as credit analysts predict a rocky year for the Illinois economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help make ends meet, some $200 million would be banked from big social media companies that Pritzker wants to tax, based on the number of users they have in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s similar to the tax Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson proposed in his city budget proposal last fall, a controversial measure that was retained in the alternate spending plan ultimately approved City Council members. Tech companies have vowed &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/10/21/brandon-johnson-social-media-tax-chicago-budget\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;to challenge such a measure in court&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chiding tech companies that “profit off of surveilling youth, creating addictive algorithms, and abandoning their responsibility to keep kids and consumers safe,” Pritzker’s plan would charge social media companies a monthly fee based on the number of users in Illinois they have beyond 100,000. That would be at rates of $0.10 per user up to 500,000 users; $40,000 plus $0.25 per user up to a million; and $165,000 plus $0.50 per user over a million. It would prohibit companies from passing those costs onto users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor’s proposal also counts on $269 million in additional corporate income tax revenue by adjusting how much big companies can deduct as losses over several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker’s plan also would generate about $120 million by taxing table games at casinos at the same rate as slot machines, which are currently at a higher bracket. That’s the governor’s only proposed change to gambling taxation in the state after two years of major additional levies on the state’s massive sports betting industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t include any of the progressive revenue ideas that had been pushed by the General Assembly’s left flank, including taxing digital ads and gains on billionaires’ assets, hiking taxes on offshore earnings and closing corporate tax loopholes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor did Pritzker’s budget team mention &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/springfield/2026/01/20/bears-stadium-northwest-indiana-arlington-heights-ballys-chicago-casino-general-assembly-spring-agenda\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a possible surcharge tax on millionaires&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an idea that has been floated by Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch that would require a state constitutional amendment. A similar Pritzker-backed initiative failed in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor’s spending plan includes $305 million for schools under the state’s evidence-based funding formula, a figure short of the usual $350 million because the remainder was used as part of a property tax relief program last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also makes the state’s required $10.7 billion payment toward pension systems that are collectively facing more than $140 billion in unfunded liabilities. Pritzker is expected to renew his push to extend the state’s goal of 100% funding by 2048, instead of the current state law with a goal of reaching 90% funded by 2045.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Pritzker’s spending proposal sets aside a flat $721.4 million for Monetary Award Program grants in financial aid for college students, while increasing public university and community college funding by 1%. The Department of Children and Family Services would see a $74 million budget increase to $1.7 billion. It also includes about $250 million for housing programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker’s budget proposal sets the stage for three months of negotiations in Springfield. Lawmakers have to approve a spending plan by the end of May, for the fiscal year that starts July 1.&lt;/p&gt;",

Según los fiscales, supuestamente siguió a una mujer por Lawndale Avenue el 12 de enero y le preguntó si necesitaba su ayuda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuando ella rechazó su oferta, White caminó delante de la mujer, luego se metió en un viaducto. Cuando ella pasó el viaducto, según la policía, la agarró y la empujó hacia un callejón en la cuadra 1400 al norte de Lawndale Avenue.

La arrastró por su suéter y le bajó los pantalones. Luego se bajó sus pantalones y la violó.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La mujer gritó, pero White le cubrió la boca mientras ella luchaba por respirar, dijeron los fiscales. White abandonó la escena después de la supuesta agresión.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La mujer llamó al 911 y fue llevada al Hospital Mount Sinai, donde recibió atención y el personal del hospital recolectó evidencia para un kit de violación. La policía habló con dueños de negocios cercanos a la escena y obtuvo un video de vigilancia que corroboró el relato de la mujer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Una semana después de la supuesta agresión, los fiscales dicen que White se acercó a una mujer en un restaurante Subway cercano y la acosó. Cuando ella no respondió, él le tocó los glúteos y ella sacó una navaja y le dijo que no la volviera a tocar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White fue arrestado, y la mujer en el caso de agresión sexual lo identificó como el hombre que la violó, dijeron los fiscales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White es un delincuente sexual registrado que violó a su hermana de 5 años cuando tenía 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En una audiencia judicial esta semana, se ordenó la detención de White hasta su próxima fecha en corte el 24 de febrero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Le recomiendo a nuestros residentes de Illinois que se aseguren de que ellos y sus familiares estén al día con la vacuna MMR y todas las demás inmunizaciones apropiadas para su edad”, agregó.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los síntomas pueden tardar de una a tres semanas en aparecer después de la exposición a alguien con sarampión, según los funcionarios de salud, lo que hace que sea aún más probable que se propague, ya que el sarampión también es una enfermedad altamente contagiosa, según la agencia de salud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Una persona puede infectar hasta 18 individuos. En contraste, la tasa de infección de la gripe es de aproximadamente una a dos personas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debido a esto, cualquier persona que no esté vacunada pero que esté expuesta debe monitorearse para detectar síntomas como erupción, fiebre alta, tos, secreción nasal y ojos rojos y llorosos durante 21 días, dijo la agencia de salud del estado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El primer caso de sarampión de este año llega mucho antes que &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/health/2025/04/24/idph-reports-first-measles-case-this-year-in-southern-illinois\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;el primer caso del año pasado&lt;/a&gt;, que no se detectó hasta mediados de abril.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois registró 14 casos en 2025 &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/health/2025/07/11/illinois-measles-outbreak-over-state-health-department-officials\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;durante su pico&lt;/a&gt; —cuando casi 1,300 casos surgieron a nivel nacional en un corto periodo, el peor brote en más de 30 años— una fuerte caída comparado al &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/health/2024/05/30/chicago-measles-outbreak-declared-over-health-department\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;brote de sarampión que duró tres meses en Chicago&lt;/a&gt; de 2024, donde se confirmaron 64 casos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Para obtener más información sobre el sarampión, comunícate con tu proveedor de atención médica o visita la &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/measles.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;página web del Departamento de Salud Pública de Illinois sobre el sarampión&lt;/a&gt; o el &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;sitio del Centros para el Control y Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) sobre el sarampión&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Louis Cameli called for congregates to embrace repentance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"These ashes represent an embrace of repentance, conversion, a change of heart, re-calibrating our lives so that they can be more in conformity with what God wants,\" Cameli preached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ash Wednesday marks the beginning of Lent, the 40-day period of reflection, praying, fasting and donating to the needy, according to the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catholics between 18 and 59 years old are typically required to fast. When fasting, a person can eat one full meal as well as two smaller meals that don’t make up a full meal. It is also tradition to abstain from eating meat on Fridays during Lent — and on Ash Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bridget O'Brien, director of ministry at Old St. Patrick's Catholic Church, noted the fasting is to \"make us conscious of our hunger for God.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It helps me to reflect on the fact that one day I will die and reflect on the life I want to lead,\" O'Brien said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Dowling, a 59-year-old River North resident who has gone to Holy Name Cathedral for about four years, is hoping to become \"more steadfast in prayer.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I want to give up some of the things in my life I'm attached to [and make sure] that I'm attached to God,\" Dowling said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ash Wednesday observers pick something enjoyable — typically a favorite food or pleasurable vice — to sacrifice for the 40-day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janett Diaz, hopes to use Lent as an opportunity to give up earthly things. Diaz, who is visiting Chicago from Panama, made it a priority to attend Ash Wednesday Mass while abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"For me, it's less shopping and maybe a little less screen time and a little less pride,\" Diaz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Diaz, Albany Park resident Ana Pizzaro wants to be closer to God and plans to use Lent as a motivational tool to establish better religious discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I came from ash, and one day when I die I will become ash again. So we need to remember that God is who made us and we will once we live our lives, we will return to Him,\" Pizzaro, 49, said. \"I like to come to Mass everyday but I need to find a way to come on time. And of course I will pray more.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observers urged anyone interested in learning more about Ash Wednesday to visit their local church in-person and be part of the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Even if you start by sitting in the last row and at least listen to what's going on in the church [and] in Mass, that helps you start,\" Pizzaro said. \"That would be a good step in starting to look for God.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Brien was \"very moved\" by the levels of diversity she has seen in congregants at the church. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"You've got guys with mud on their boots and hard hats who are coming together right off of a construction site, you've got nurses in scrubs, people in very fancy suits ... just a reminder of the brotherhood and sisterhood and everyone coming together because this is a meaningful start to them,\" O'Brien said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        &lt;bsp-carousel class=\"Carousel Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"gallery-920001\" name=\"gallery-920001\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slides\"&gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slide\"&gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-media\"&gt;\n        \n            \n                \n                    &lt;picture data-crop=\"large\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0ff7ee0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6883x4548+0+22/resize/840x555!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2F77%2F130ecfbc4afabbdd408e32501c61%2Fashwednesday-260219-04.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c03993/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6883x4548+0+22/resize/1680x1110!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2F77%2F130ecfbc4afabbdd408e32501c61%2Fashwednesday-260219-04.jpg 2x\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/411433a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6883x4548+0+22/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2F77%2F130ecfbc4afabbdd408e32501c61%2Fashwednesday-260219-04.jpg\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"ASHWEDNESDAY_260219-04.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/411433a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6883x4548+0+22/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2F77%2F130ecfbc4afabbdd408e32501c61%2Fashwednesday-260219-04.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fb02eb1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6883x4548+0+22/resize/1680x1110!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2F77%2F130ecfbc4afabbdd408e32501c61%2Fashwednesday-260219-04.jpg 2x\" width=\"840\" height=\"555\"\n        src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/411433a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6883x4548+0+22/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2F77%2F130ecfbc4afabbdd408e32501c61%2Fashwednesday-260219-04.jpg\"&gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n                \n            \n        \n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-info\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-infoTitle\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-infoDescription\"&gt;A congregant prays after receiving the imposition of ashes at Holy Name Cathedral on Ash Wednesday.&lt;/span&gt;\n            \n            \n                &lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-pipe\"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-infoAttribution\"&gt;Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-pagination\"&gt;\n            &lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-currentSlide\"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

Jesse Jackson, a Chicago icon known for his work as a civil rights leader, who &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/obituaries/2026/02/17/rev-jesse-jackson-civil-rights-leader-rainbow-push-obituary\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“died peacefully” at age 84&lt;/a&gt;, his family said during a morning press conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarded as Martin Luther King Jr.'s protege, Jackson worked tirelessly throughout the Civil Rights movement and after to champion rights for Black people. He started the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the famed Chicago-based multiracial nonprofit, in 1970, and it continues to fight for social change, economic equality and civil rights. In the 1980s, Jackson ran the first viable presidential campaign by a Black candidate in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of his death, leaders around the world and Chicago residents have shared messages of support for the family, remembering Jackson for his years of activism while mourning his loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How did he die?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the family has not officially given a cause of death, or said where he died, Jackson had been declining in health for a decade before his passing. In 2015,&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2017/11/17/18375473/rev-jesse-jackson-announces-parkinson-s-diagnosis\"   &gt; Jackson was initially diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, but he revealed last April that it was actually progressive supranuclear palsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What services have been scheduled?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details on the services — part of which will be held at Rainbow PUSH headquarters — are expected by late Wednesday. Relatives of Jackson added that \"all are welcome\" regardless of political party,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family is still deciding on a church, which will have to be large enough to accommodate everyone, relatives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How is the political world reacting to his death?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political figures from across the country have weighed in to share their respects and honor his legacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement, former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama wrote, \"Michelle and I will always be grateful for Jesse's lifetime of service, and the friendship our families share. We stood on his shoulders. We send our deepest condolences to the Jackson family and everyone in Chicago and beyond who knew and loved him.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump also extended his sympathies to Jackson's family in a statement posted to Truth Social on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I knew him well, long before becoming President,\" he said... \"He was very gregarious - Some who truly loved people! Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago leaders including Mayor Brandon Johnson and Governor J.B. Pritzker also shared their condolences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"In honor of Rev. Jackson's service, and as our city mourns, the Chicago flag will lower to half-staff,\" Mayor Johnson wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker also ordered all flags across the state to fly at half-mast to honor him in a statement posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He broke down barriers, inspired generations, and kept hope alive. Our state, nation, and world are better due to his years of service,\" Pritzker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How are Chicago residents reacting to his death?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the city, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2026/02/17/jesse-jackson-chicago-remembers\"   &gt;Chicago residents mourned Jackson’s passing&lt;/a&gt; and urge for his legacy to live on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Travis, a congregant at Apostolic Church of God in Woodlawn, said in his youth, his parents brought him to demonstrations organized by Operation Breadbasket, a group Jackson led. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, 64, Travis remembers Jackson as \"instrumental in fighting for justice and freedom for all people.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chloe Gould, 41, a Bronzeville resident, said that his death still hit \"like you lost a family member.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of his death, she said she worries for the future of civil rights activism, as activists and leaders have not stepped in to fill his shoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Who is gonna be the civil rights activist now?\" she said. &lt;/p&gt;",

He and Johnson played together at North Carolina, Lawing at receiver and Johnson at quarterback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isaiah Ford was named the team’s quality control coach. He played receiver for the Dolphins from 2018-21, which overlapped with Johnson's tenure, and was briefly a member of the Bears in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the additions but Ford were previously reported by the Sun-Times, though Lawing’s specific role was unclear before Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson and general manager Ryan Poles are expected to address coaching staff changes, and other topics, when they speak to the media Tuesday at the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis.&lt;/p&gt;",

On Friday, Qi completed his quarantine period and was placed in his permanent habitat at the zoo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since his arrival, Qi has made himself right at home, Cassy Kutilek, curator of large mammals and carnivores at Lincoln Park Zoo, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Everybody loves a red panda, right?\" Kutilek said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi was brought to Lincoln Park Zoo because of a breeding recommendation, Kutilek said. Qi will be a new mate for Nisha, who is 8, a female red panda who has been at the zoo for several years. Kutilek said his arrival is perfectly timed, as red pandas typically breed between January and March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the pair met for the first time, and Kutilek said they seem to be compatible based on their genetics and behaviors. Qi, who is more assertive in nature, meshes well with Nisha's personality, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"So far, it's been a love connection,\" Kutilek said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Friday, Kutilek said she has seen an influx of visitors at the zoo due to unseasonably warm temperatures. On Tuesday, she said she saw a young boy dressed up like a red panda to celebrate Qi's arrival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"These guys tend to be nocturnal, so if you come in the middle of the day, it can be a little bit difficult to see them,\" she said. \"But, honestly, these guys have been really interested in staying outside and utilizing all of their perching.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The red pandas, native to high mountain forests in East Asia and the Himalayas, are an endangered species, with only 87 currently living across North America, Kutilek said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The zoo was recommended to breed the two because of a species survival plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We're really hopeful that these behaviors that we're seeing, the positive interactions that we're seeing between the two pandas will eventually lead us to having cubs later this year,\" Kutilek said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"But if not, then we will continue to house them together and watch their interactions and see what the next breeding season holds for us.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

If anything, the hope should be for a continual sinking with the team currently outside of the play-in tournament and carrying the fourth-toughest remaining schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Bulls play their cards right in pursuit of better draft lottery odds, within the next week they could drop below Milwaukee and start chasing down Memphis for the eighth-worst record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goals, people, goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s worth watching, however, is the personnel rolled out the remaining 27 games of the regular season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Josh Giddey (hamstring) a full participant in practice and Tre Jones (hamstring) getting close, the Bulls guard room is once again standing room only.

Wes Unseld Jr. will coach in Donovan’s place Thursday, while Donovan is attending his father’s funeral, and it will be Donovan back in his seat for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the All-Star Break, Donovan made his priorities very clear. It comes down to survival of the fittest, or in this case survival of who is playing the best. If the team’s medical staff wants to hold guys back, that’s on them. It won’t be on the coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think guys are going to have to earn minutes,” Donovan said. “Because of all the guards we have we’re not going to be able to play all of them because we’ll have size issues too, so you may get playing Jalen (Smith) and Nick Richards together, and if you have Matas (Buzelis) out there or Patrick (Williams) out there, there’s only two guard spots, so you’re going to have four guards sitting on the bench. That could happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What complicates all of this is the contract situation of the players involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giddey and Jones are locked in —  Giddey through the 2028-29 season and Jones through 2027-28. Dillingham is on his rookie deal, so has time to continue to develop. Ivey will be a restricted free agent this summer, so the Bulls will have the final say on his future no matter what the market dictates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simons and Sexton, however, are unrestricted free agents, and executive vice president of basketball operations Arturas Karnisovas did not show his hand on what their futures might be after they were acquired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexton and Simons are somewhat redundant players in that they each shoot around 38% from three-point range and can play either guard spot in a pinch, but Sexton is better at getting to the free-throw line and plays with a bit more intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They likely won’t keep both, and there is a very real scenario in which neither stays with the Bulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The draft is guard heavy in the top 10, starting with Kansas standout Darryn Peterson who could go No. 1 overall. But even if the Bulls miss out on lady luck smiling down on them there’s still Houston’s Kingston Flemings, Louisville’s Mikel Brown Jr., Keaton Wagler from Illinois, Darius Acuff from Arkansas and Alabama’s Labaron Philon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throw any of those soon-to-be rookies into the mix and it would seem Giddey, Jones, Dillingham and Ivey would be more than enough to start the 2026-27 season with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What also shouldn’t be ruled out? If the Bulls go big in the draft, there are whispers in the organization that they could simply look to bring Ayo Dosunmu back into the mix. He was traded to Minnesota in the Dillingham deal but will be an unrestricted free agent for a Timberwolves roster that is pushing toward the second apron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First things first, though. There are 27 games left and it will be interesting to see how Donovan and his staff play them. More importantly, who they play them with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module data-hide-authors=\"true\"

It calls for up to 3,737 residences,  20% of them designated as affordable to comply with the city’s setaside rules. The new design includes low- to mid-rise buildings, some for offices, grouped near open space and riverfront access. Buildings would get ground-floor retail, and one is slated as a boutique hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toned-down approach and reduced density has drawn praise from local residents, Plan Commission members and local Ald. Scott Waguespack (32nd), who inherited the stalled project from Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) when ward boundaries were redrawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because it is less congested, less costly and ambitious and, therefore, more likely to be delivered than the $6 billion &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/06/27/lincoln-yards-sterling-bay-jdl-development-jim-letchinger-rahm-emanuel\"   &gt;Lincoln Yards plan that collapsed last year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-830000\" name=\"image-830000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/81421a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F77%2Fe8e5312e4c2589e8f0503dd360fe%2Fwatchdogs-062225-21.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2f431f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F77%2Fe8e5312e4c2589e8f0503dd360fe%2Fwatchdogs-062225-21.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de1ef5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F77%2Fe8e5312e4c2589e8f0503dd360fe%2Fwatchdogs-062225-21.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A sun bleached rendering of what the Lincoln Yards project promised sits in the overgrown lot that is the site today, Tuesday, June 17, 2025, in Chicago.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de1ef5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F77%2Fe8e5312e4c2589e8f0503dd360fe%2Fwatchdogs-062225-21.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fa6981/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F77%2Fe8e5312e4c2589e8f0503dd360fe%2Fwatchdogs-062225-21.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de1ef5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F77%2Fe8e5312e4c2589e8f0503dd360fe%2Fwatchdogs-062225-21.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sun bleached rendering of what the Lincoln Yards project promised sits in the overgrown lot that is now the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Letchinger has assured the Chicago Plan Commission and the City Council’s Zoning Committee that he and partner Kayne Anderson Real Estate have the financing lined up begin the first construction phase, costing about $800 million, late in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His goal is to build a neighborhood  that invites people to visit and shop, connecting Foundry Park to adjacent residential areas. The tallest building in his plan is around 40 stories. The project  also includes some single-family homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not only are we not gating the community, we are inviting the community,” Letchinger told the Chicago Plan Commission last month. “We’re optimistic that we can have this entire site built in seven years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foundry Park name refers to the property’s former use by Finkl Steel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JDL’s design with Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture sketches out a site plan with about a quarter of the acreage reserved for open space, including new riverfront paths. Parking for about 300 cars would be below grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only parking access would be from Kingsbury Street, amounting to the only curb cuts in the development. Letchinger said the design would help traffic flow, a concern that lingers despite qualified support for the project from local groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly before leaving office, then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel convinced the City Council to approve a combined $2.4 billion in city subsidies for a pair of megaprojects he believed had potential to dramatically increase Chicago’s shrinking tax base. Lincoln Yards was one of them. The other was “The 78,” the long-dormant parcel at Roosevelt and Clark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 78 remains vacant, having been eyed by the White Sox most recently for a proposed taxpayer-funded baseball stadium — an idea that so far has yet to gain any traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Lincoln Yards, it took its developer, Sterling Bay, until 2021 to break ground on a $200 million life sciences building that remains vacant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still to be decided is how much support from tax increment financing the project gets.  The  Lincoln Yards project was in line for up to $1.3 billion in TIF help for infrastructure work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foundry Park would be eligible for less money, but many still hope to extend Chicago’s Bloomingdale Trail, called The 606, into the development. It would have to be built across a highway, Metra tracks and the river — all expensive propositions. TIF discussions are in “early-ish” stages, according to Boatright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c10000\" name=\"image-c10000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5cc5057/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1239x695+0+18/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa1%2F04%2F115b67b945529a0b84833186aa9c%2Ffoundry-park-riverwalk.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8b12eb6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1239x695+0+18/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa1%2F04%2F115b67b945529a0b84833186aa9c%2Ffoundry-park-riverwalk.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7421be1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1239x695+0+18/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa1%2F04%2F115b67b945529a0b84833186aa9c%2Ffoundry-park-riverwalk.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Foundry Park riverwalk.png\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7421be1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1239x695+0+18/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa1%2F04%2F115b67b945529a0b84833186aa9c%2Ffoundry-park-riverwalk.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ecbe156/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1239x695+0+18/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa1%2F04%2F115b67b945529a0b84833186aa9c%2Ffoundry-park-riverwalk.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7421be1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1239x695+0+18/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa1%2F04%2F115b67b945529a0b84833186aa9c%2Ffoundry-park-riverwalk.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rendering of Foundry Park&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of JDL Development and the Chicago Plan Commission&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopkins cast the lone no vote on the project, unwilling to “walk away” from the $800 million worth of roads, bridges, utilities, and mass transit improvements that he said were “mandated” as part of the Lincoln Yards plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’ll be thousands of new housing units. Thousands of new families. Tens of thousands of square feet of new mixed-use development and no infrastructure to support it as of today.

All of those things that were promised to the neighborhood as a contingent for their support of Lincoln Yards.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waguespack acknowledged that significant transportation challenges remain for the “vastly different” plan for Foundry Park.&lt;br&gt;But he said those problems will require a “more holistic approach,” adding that he’s confident residents will “see results as the project moves forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/06/27/lincoln-yards-sterling-bay-jdl-development-jim-letchinger-rahm-emanuel\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;The failed dream of Lincoln Yards&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Jesse Jackson \"with action,\" and urged the City Council and all Chicagoans to do just that to honor “one of the most consequential civil rights leaders of our time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can best honor Reverend Jackson by `keeping hope alive,’“ the mayor said before leading the Council in a moment of silence for Jackson and his grieving family. “We do that by organizing with our neighbors, advocating on their behalf and investing in the people of Chicago. In the loving memory of Reverend Jackson, let us go forth in building a just, equitable and thriving city and nation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson has said he would not have risen from single-digit obscurity to the mayor’s office without standing on Jackson’s shoulders. On Wednesday, the mayor talked about the poignant personal advice that Jackson, his mentor and role model, gave him when Johnson was \"&lt;br&gt;experiencing one of the more difficult times in my time as an organizer\" for the Chicago Teachers Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Rev. Jackson reminded me that, before people were on that Edmund Pettus Bridge, it took an awful lot to organize city to city to get to Selma,” Johnson said. “That day everybody and their mother was on that bridge. But in reality that wasn’t the case. That in most instances, transformation and change takes place by just the work of a few.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor said Jackson’s wisdom and guidance had a “profound impact on me and I’m grateful to him forever.” But the city owes Jackson, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/obituaries/2026/02/17/rev-jesse-jackson-civil-rights-leader-rainbow-push-obituary\"   &gt;who died Tuesday &lt;/a&gt;at the age of 84, “a debt of gratitude for his life’s work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together, Dr. King and Rev. Jackson made Chicago a battleground for fair housing, equality and economic justice. They spread a message of empowerment, equality and justice worldwide,” the mayor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No matter what the issue or challenge, he stood on the side of working people and… affirmed their humanity by fighting for equal access to education, housing, employment and health care. In doing so, he cultivated a rainbow of power that could weather any storm.”&lt;/p&gt;",

Dr. Martin Luther King than Rev. Jesse Lewis Jackson,” said Santita Jackson, Jesse Jackson’s eldest daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Jackson died peacefully early Tuesday morning surrounded by his family, who said they will honor his life by carrying forward his commitment to justice and equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reverend had been in declining health for more than a decade. In 2017, he announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease two years earlier, but last April he revealed the diagnosis was actually progressive supranuclear palsy, a condition that also affects bodily movement. He was also hospitalized just months before he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in his final moments, Jackson’s children said their father never spoke about his pain and continued to “bounce back,” driven by his lifelong devotion to helping others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yusef Jackson said what kept his father going “was not his desire for more life, but his desire for more service.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His family said they reassured Jesse Jackson before he died that they would “continue his work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each of my siblings and my mother, we wanted to give him comfort that it was going to be all right, that he has taught us enough to continue his work,” said Yusef Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yusef Jackson said he would be taking the reins of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the famed Chicago-based multiracial nonprofit Jesse Jackson started in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Jackson never held public office, but in the 1980s, he ran the first viable presidential campaign by a Black candidate. His son, U.S. Rep. Jonathan Jackson, said he would use his congressional seat to continue to fight for equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That's our calling, that's our mission, and that's what we're going to fight for,” said Jonathan Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funeral services for Jesse Jackson are expected to begin next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reverend’s eldest son, Jesse Jackson Jr., said the services will welcome all, regardless of political party, but urged attendees to “not bring your politics out of respect” to his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His life is broad enough to cover the full spectrum of what it means to be an American,” said Jesse Jackson Jr. “We only ask people to come and be respectful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details about the services were not known, but relatives said Jesse Jackson will be lying in state at Rainbow PUSH headquarters, and services would follow at a church large enough to accommodate a large crowd.&lt;/p&gt;",

On Wednesday, the Circuit Court of Cook County granted plaintiff Steven Rogers’ request to file his complaint under seal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogers, a former Northwestern professor and entrepreneur, is &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2026/02/01/sky-principal-owner-michael-alter-sued-by-early-minority-investor-over-ownership-stake\"   &gt;suing principal owner Michael Alter for breach of contract and fiduciary duty&lt;/a&gt;. In his motion to seal, Rogers argued that the team’s operating agreement and a nondisclosure agreement prohibit public disclosure of confidential information. Alter’s counsel did not object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves the public with a heavily redacted complaint in which the mechanics of how Alter allegedly “seized a major stake of the team, with no lawful basis and at an unfair price and at the expense of the other investors,” remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading between the lines, Rogers’ two broad claims emerge: that Alter, as sole manager of the investment trust, ignored record-keeping and approval procedures required by the operating agreement, and that he engaged in opportunistic self-dealing that diluted minority investors as the franchise’s value surged. Alter, through his lawyer,  has called those allegations “meritless.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple investors who spoke to the Sun-Times believe Rogers’ allegations center on a debt-to-equity conversion Alter conducted around the time of the team’s 2023 capital raise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, the Sky raised $8.5 million from a small group of investors including Laura Ricketts, Mary Dillon and Dwyane Wade, at an $85 million valuation. At the time, the team said the funds would be used to improve player experience and help finance &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2026/02/06/skys-new-practice-facility-will-be-ready-by-late-spring-ceo-adam-fox-says\"   &gt;a dedicated practice facility&lt;/a&gt;, which they needed to keep pace in a growing league. Since then, the league has boomed; expansion franchises are now paying $250 million fees to join.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its face, there is nothing nefarious about swapping debt for equity. Investors estimate Alter loaned between $20 million and $30 million to the Sky over its 20-year history to keep the team afloat. In a debt-for-equity swap, instead of the team repaying that money in cash, the lender converts the debt into additional ownership. The consequence is dilution: existing minority owners’ percentage stakes shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key questions are whether the conversion was authorized under the operating agreement and whether the process was fair. Because Alter owes fiduciary duties to minority investors, courts typically examine whether there was proper disclosure, approval and independent oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the operating agreement now sealed, what remains are competing accounts from Sky investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linda Friedman, a member of the original investor group and one of the largest investors behind Alter, strongly disagrees with Rogers’ claims and believes Alter has always operated the business with integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The idea that he cheated anybody is so unfair,” Friedman told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said investors received “complete disclosure” of the transaction and that Alter converted at the same valuation as the outside group, providing documentation that illustrated the dilutive impact on her ownership stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her view, the debt conversion was essential to the $8.5 million capital raise. She said Alter initially sought to raise a much larger amount, but outside investors balked at the franchise’s history of losses and significant debt load. Converting the debt, she said, made the limited capital raise possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another early investor, speaking on the condition of anonymity, offered a different view. He said the capital raise fell short because of a scattered approach to fundraising. He echoed Rogers’ concerns about governance and transparency, saying he did not realize Alter’s loans were convertible and did not understand how the conversion was valued. Past suggestions to strengthen oversight, he added, were dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he acknowledged that for much of the Sky’s history, minority investors paid little attention to governance because the franchise didn’t have much economic value. As the asset has grown more substantial, he expects oversight to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this time, no other minority investors have joined Rogers’ suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alter has been served, and the court set a status date for April 20.

ESPN reported Hammock would join the Seahawks as running backs coach and senior offensive assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hammock was 35-47 at Northern Illinois, with his 2021 team going 9-5 with a win over Kent State in the MAC title game. The Huskies won back-to-back bowls in 2023 and '24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hammock's biggest win was in 2024 when the Huskies scored the go-ahead field goal with 31 seconds left and blocked a 62-yard try as time expired to beat fifth-ranked Notre Dame 16-14. The Huskies slipped to 3-9 last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northern Illinois will become a football-only member of the Mountain West Conference this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Under Coach Hammock's leadership, the Huskie football program has achieved historic milestones on the field as well as academically over the last seven seasons,\" Frazier said. \"His passion for NIU and commitment to developing young men — on and off the playing field — will be his legacy.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Each needed extra hockey to get through the quarterfinals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinn Hughes scored in overtime to put the U.S. past Sweden 2-1 after giving up the tying goal to Mika Zibanejad with 91 seconds left in the third period. Dylan Larkin deflected Jack Hughes' shot in for the only U.S. goal in regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier Wednesday, Nick Suzuki tied it for Canada late in regulation against Czechia, and Mitch Marner won it 4-3 in overtime to avoid what would have been a stunning early exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It was just all relief,\" Canada's Macklin Celebrini said after scoring three minutes in and then assisting on Marner's goal. \"A weight lifted off our shoulders, for sure. Just seeing that puck go in, knowing that we won the game. ... It was a good feeling for all of us.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finland also escaped an upset bid by rallying to beat Switzerland 3-2 in OT. Sweden is going home early from a tournament that did not go as planned for a team with a full roster of 25 NHL players, while upstart Slovakia is making another improbable run at the Games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Canada did its part, albeit with a roller coaster of drama and emotion, the U.S. kept alive the possibility of the North American rivals meeting in the gold medal game Sunday by riding goaltender Connor Hellebuyck's solid play past Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. will face Slovakia in one semifinal on Friday night. Just before that, also unbeaten Canada plays Finland in the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Canada survives an upset scare from Czechia&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After losing captain Sidney Crosby to injury, Canada was staring down what would have been a stunning quarterfinal exit until Nick Suzuki tied it on a deflection goal with 3:27 left. Then Mitch Marner scored a little more than a minute into overtime to beat Czechia 4-3 and send the tournament favorite into the semifinals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Everybody had complete faith in whoever was going over the boards,\" coach Jon Cooper said. \"It just felt it was like a matter of time. It was going to happen.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nerves were palpable when Canada fell behind with 7:42 remaining on Ondrej Palat's goal on an odd-man rush off a pass from Martin Necas. Replays showed Czechia had six skaters on the ice, which Nathan MacKinnon said he and his teammates were aware of, even if on-ice officials didn't notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suzuki just about did it all on the tying goal, sending the puck out to the point to Devon Toews and then redirecting the defenseman's shot that was going well wide past Lukas Dostal and into the net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Toewser gave me a perfect opportunity to tip it,\" Suzuki said. \"Just trying to put something on net there.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan Binnington denied David Pastrnak on a breakaway with 70 seconds left to send the game past regulation. It was the biggest of Binnington's 21 saves in an excellent performance from Canada's starter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Marner summoned some more heroics playing for Canada, scoring his second OT goal in an international tournament in as many chances. Marner also scored in a similar fashion a year ago at the 4 Nations Face-Off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's the 'it' factor, man: Mitch Marner's got it,\" Cooper said. \"He doesn't disappoint. Sometimes your hair falls out at times, but in the end, he never disappoints.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Finland also ties it late and wins in OT&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like Canada, Finland was trailing late in its game against Switzerland. The Finns also got a late goal to avoid an upset defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miro Heiskanen tied it with 72 seconds left, Artturi Lehkonen scored in overtime and Finland escaped with a 3-2 victory. Heiskanen's shot banked in off Switzerland defenseman Jonas Siegenthaler's stick and past goaltender Leonardo Genoni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We are a relentless team,\" Heiskanen said. \"We never give up. We know we had a tough start. It was a slow start, but we kept playing, kept working and it paid off.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finland was actually down two goals after Switzerland's Damien Riat and Nino Niederreiter scored 1 minute, 12 seconds apart in the first period. It took until there was 6:06 left before Sebastian Aho got Finland on the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Slovakia reaches the semis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dalibor Dvorsky turned in another brilliant performance with a goal and an assist, fellow NHL forward Pavol Regenda scored twice as part of his three-point game and Slovakia dominated Germany 6-2 on to reach the semifinals and guarantee playing for a medal in Milan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Amazing,\" said alternate captain Erik Cernak, a two-time Stanley Cup champion with the Tampa Bay Lightning. \"Before the tournament, if we would say we're going to make semifinals, probably people would laugh at you. But we did it, and it's not done yet.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slovakia got an injury scare in the second period when 21-year-old emerging Montreal Canadiens star Juraj Slafkovsky, the reigning Olympic MVP, went head-first into the boards and was slow to get up. A trainer applied an ice pack to the back of Slafkovsky's neck, and he held it on himself when he got up to celebrate a goal scored while he was getting medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I'm OK,\" Slafkovsky said. \"I was a little shaken up, but after a couple minutes I felt OK again. I went out there, and head wasn't spinning. I was seeing normal.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Marty Quinn (13th)&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/02/13/mayor-brandon-johnson-hemp-ban-veto-marty-quinn\"   &gt; told the Chicago Sun-Times &lt;/a&gt;last week that he had no intention of attempting an override because, “I don’t have the votes.” But that didn’t stop 9th Ward Ald. Anthony Beale, Johnson’s most outspoken Council critic, from trying for an  override.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That effort  failed — as Quinn predicted that it would — by eight votes shy of the 34 votes needed. The Council's decision means hemp-derived products can continue to be sold in Chicago — at least until a federal ban takes effect later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate that preceded Wednesday’s vote was an emotional repeat of the arguments on both sides that have been made for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public Safety Committee Chair Brian Hopkins (2nd) said it is “unconscionable and inexcusable” that City Hall is allowing adults and children alike to put their health at risk by buying “an untested, unregulated product from an unlicensed facility that has something in it that gets you high, and you don’t know what it is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t care if people make money selling it [on the] black market. You know what else is illegal and is sold every day? Cocaine, fentanyl, heroin. It’s sold all over the city, but we don’t say, 'Well, we better let it be sold in gas stations too, because they’re gonna sell it anyway,'” Hopkins said.  \"These are dangerous, harmful products. Children are getting sick. They need to be banned. And all the rest of this is just an excuse, and it’s nonsense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson has said he shares concerns about children’s safety. But he warned that a “Prohibition-style ban” could harm  small businesses  and minority-owned businesses in particular, that were “shut out of he expensive cannabis licensing process and turned to federally legal hemp as a pathway into the marketplace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Side Ald. Maria Hadden (49th) agreed that the Council needs to find a way to devise “something sensible that does not shut out a market of people who have created businesses because they were shut out of the cannabis industry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council also rejected &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/12/03/daniel-laspata-parking-violations-citizen-reporting-ordinance-business-community\"   &gt;a two-year-plan&lt;/a&gt; that would have allowed Chicagoans to use their cellphones to provide recorded evidence of bus, bike lane and crosswalk parking violations. The crackdown was championed by Pedestrian and Traffic Safety Committee Chair Daniel La Spata (1st), who has also tried and failed to persuade his colleagues to reduce the default speed limit on Chicago streets to 25 miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Spata’s proposal to unleash what could have been an avalanche of citizen-generated parking tickets raised concerns from business groups that feared it could stifle local commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hopkins  shared those concerns, particularly when it comes to the stretch of Wells Street between North Avenue and Division Street with a thriving night life that includes restaurants, bars and night clubs. The area has no alley or loading docks. Delivery trucks can only pull up on Wells, where there are bikes lanes on either side of the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I start getting angry phone calls from Budweiser beer trucks and lobster companies — they’re going to really start getting angry when they get orange tickets piling up under their windshield wipers — I have to have something to tell them other than, ‘Get out your checkbook,’ “ Hopkins said on the day La Spata pushed the ordinance through his committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Council also signed off on $29.1 million in settlements linked to allegations of police misconduct committed by now retired&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/11/07/reynaldo-guevara-jose-maysonet-wrongful-murder-conviction-17-million-settlement\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Chicago Police detective Reynaldo Guevara. &lt;/a&gt;All four proposed recipients were framed for murders they did not commit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Johnson appointed LaKenya White as chief administrator of the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, which has been placed in charge of investigating any allegations against Chicago police officers accused of assisting federal immigration enforcement in violations of Chicago’s Welcoming City ordinance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White has served as interim chief administrator since former chief Andrea Kersten was forced out amid allegations that she was presiding over investigations biased against police officers.&lt;/p&gt;",

I feel more accomplished, I know better because of the experiences I’ve had before and that’s something I’m going to be able to translate to this year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pereira has emerged as a strong candidate for regular playing time in a Sox outfield that has seen the departure of starting center fielder &lt;b&gt;Luis Robert Jr.&lt;/b&gt; and likely limited time in the field for &lt;b&gt;Andrew Benintendi&lt;/b&gt;, who lost some weight in the offseason to ease an Achilles tendon that landed him on the injured list at the end of last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seeing him run around in the outfield a little bit, certainly like how he goes about it from his pre-pitch setup and first step stuff,” Sox manager &lt;b&gt;Will Venable&lt;/b&gt; said. “He’s a guy who is really thoughtful about the way he moves out there. Just at the plate, a really sound approach. Not a lot going on with his moves, really simple and he’s getting the barrel to the ball a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two spots in the outfield are likely claimed with Pereira’s fellow Venezuelan countryman, &lt;b&gt;Luisangel Acuña&lt;/b&gt; assuming center field duties and free-agent signee &lt;b&gt;Austin Hays&lt;/b&gt; taking the corners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves Pereira, &lt;b&gt;Brooks Baldwin&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Derek Hill&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Jarred Kelenic&lt;/b&gt; fighting for the fourth outfielder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Murakami in starting lineup Friday vs. Cubs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venable said Wednesday that new corner infielder &lt;b&gt;Munetaka Murakami&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Kyle Teel&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Sam Antonacci&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Curtis Mead&lt;/b&gt; will all be in the Sox’ starting lineup Friday in the Cactus League opener against the Cubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because they’re all leaving Camelback Ranch later this month to compete in the World Baseball Classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expect to see those guys, along with closer &lt;b&gt;Seranthony Dominguez&lt;/b&gt;, who isn’t scheduled to pitch Friday, get more playing time before they depart camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teel and Antonacci are playing for Team Italy, while Murakami is playing with Team Japan, Mead for Team Australia and Dominguez for Team Dominican Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roch watch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The projected No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 MLB Draft, &lt;b&gt;Roch Cholowsky&lt;/b&gt;, has so far lived up to that hype with a hot start to his season at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shortstop homered twice in the Bruins’ win Tuesday, finishing 3-for-4, also with a double, walk and three RBIs and four runs scored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In four games this season, Cholowsky is 7-for-16 at the plate with three home runs, three doubles, three walks, five RBIs and nine runs scored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListL\" data-module  data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-4a0005\" name=\"list-4a0005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, pagination=[{body=[Next Page], href=?p=2, _template=/link/Link.hbs, contentId=null, pianoSectionSlug=null, target=null}], inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, pageCount=2426, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, items=[{type=Image, category=[{items=[White Sox]}], wordCount=646, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2026/02/18/jonathan-cannon-feeling-more-confident-in-2026-with-new-sinker-grip, _styledTemplate=null, title=White Sox pitcher Jonathan Cannon feeling more confident in 2026 with new sinker grip, imageAlignment=null, authors=[{ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, media=[{alt=image-0.png, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/68/33/ea81445ff48e4ff3c92389c7a469/image-0.png, width=512, height=512}, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/68/33/ea81445ff48e4ff3c92389c7a469/image-0.png, width=512, height=512}}], name=[{items=[Kade Heather]}], _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[], authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/kade-heather, jobTitle=[{items=[News reporter]}]}], categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox, description=[{items=[The 6-foot-6 right-hander will start for the spring training opener Friday against the Cubs.]}], isFeatured=false, anchorId=promo-550000, target=null, media=[{narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/de/4c/f4c762504791b8e44379357a4707/cannon.jpg, width=1024, height=683}, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/de/4c/f4c762504791b8e44379357a4707/cannon.jpg, width=1024, height=683}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=cannon.jpg}], primaryMediaType=null, ampLink=null, audio=[], timestamp=1771453372000, audioDuration=null, publishDate=February 18, 2026 04:22 PM, _template=/page/promo/PagePromo.hbs}, {type=Image, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb, isFeatured=false, wordCount=173, anchorId=promo-550001, timestamp=1771369279000, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb/2026/02/17/mlbpa-boss-tony-clark-resigns, target=null, primaryMediaType=null, title=MLBPA boss Tony Clark resigns after &amp;#x27;inappropriate&amp;#x27;

Instead, 'boneless wings' is a common term that has existed for over two decades,” Tharp wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tharp added that while Halim had standing to bring the claim, having presented enough evidence to suggest he suffered a financial loss, he failed to show that a reasonable consumer would be misled by Buffalo Wild Wings' use of the term “boneless wings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tharp said Halim has until March 20 to amend his complaint but said that it would be difficult to overturn the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;",

The latter grip is what worked well for him at the University of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the day, the [analytics] can tell you what you want and everything, but the final say is the hitter,” said Cannon, 25, who will start for the White Sox in their spring training opener Friday against the Cubs in Mesa. He’s slated to pitch two innings in that game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After struggling to a 5.34 ERA last season, Cannon was sent down to Triple-A in August. He was recalled about a month later, did not pitch well in one start and was sent down again. Cannon finished the 2025 season with a 5.82 ERA over 103⅔ innings pitched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannon chalks up the underperformance to trying to do too many things at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just kind of hit the fire drill too soon and it just kind of led to other things,” Cannon said. “... It was just kind of a snowball effect. Once that snowball kind of got going, it was tough to turn around, but I thought it was a great learning experience for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was tough. Just very mentally challenging,” Cannon said of being demoted to the minors. “I was probably a year and a half removed from being in the minor leagues and so to get sent back down there in my second year, [when] I was hoping to take a step forward was definitely mentally tough, definitely wore on me a little bit, so I feel like looking back on it now — it’s obviously hard to see it when you’re in it — but looking back on it now, it was just mentally what I needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sox catcher Korey Lee, also sent to Triple-A last season, said he sees a lot of maturity in Cannon this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think people grow as pitchers every single offseason. I think people learn from their mistakes, what they did,” Lee said. “During the season, then they continue to grow with what they’re really, really good at, so just making adjustments throughout the offseason is really, really important for all the pitchers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannon has simplified things in the offseason and has come back into spring training with more confidence in his sinker, which he often relies on, along with an arsenal that includes a cutter, changeup, four-seam fastball and sweeper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The version of his sinker that didn’t produce positive results broke sooner after his release than he’d hoped, giving hitters a better look at the pitch as it approached the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[I’m] trying to get it to seam shift a little bit more,” Cannon said. “I really wasn’t doing that. … It [breaks] a little bit later, a little bit sharper. The feedback I’ve gotten back from the catchers and hitters has been great so far, so I think that’ll be a great pitch for me this year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sox manager Will Venable said Cannon has to find creative ways to get left-handed hitters out. Lefties hit .295 against Cannon last year, while righties batted .261.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whether it’s the changeup, fastball location. There’s a lot of different ways that he’s able to get guys out.

He turned to his college sweetheart and said: “Baby, I think we’re going to be OK. What we’re going to do is get to work, and we’re going to be just fine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the decades that followed, the Rev. Jesse Jackson left a profound mark on the city where he organized and founded what would become the influential civil rights organization Rainbow PUSH Coalition. But in interviews with WBEZ, his friends and family also paint a portrait of how the generous and loyal community he found in Chicago sustained the civil rights icon throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singer and political commentator Santita Jackson talked not about the political power her father amassed in Chicago, but about the warm welcome and mutual aid he and his family received — particularly in those early years — from a veritable who’s-who of storied Black Chicagoans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were never alone, never alone, and that’s the great thing about this city,” the 63-year-old said. “It is a city that will embrace you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santita and her family found themselves in need of that tight hug on Tuesday morning, just hours after their father passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-4e0000\" name=\"image-4e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/90ca3fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Ffd%2Fc7e971c445d68cb67f85adde2f21%2Fjacksonfamily-260219-049.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c84a74a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Ffd%2Fc7e971c445d68cb67f85adde2f21%2Fjacksonfamily-260219-049.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b3a8e6a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Ffd%2Fc7e971c445d68cb67f85adde2f21%2Fjacksonfamily-260219-049.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"JACKSONFAMILY_260219-049.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b3a8e6a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Ffd%2Fc7e971c445d68cb67f85adde2f21%2Fjacksonfamily-260219-049.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1db85b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Ffd%2Fc7e971c445d68cb67f85adde2f21%2Fjacksonfamily-260219-049.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b3a8e6a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Ffd%2Fc7e971c445d68cb67f85adde2f21%2Fjacksonfamily-260219-049.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flanked by her siblings, Santita Jackson speaks about her late father, Rev.

He said Jacqueline Jackson, now 81, held him and said, “Boy, you better squeeze me tight because if it wasn’t for your grandfather, we don’t know where we would be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Leak’s grandfather, A.R. Leak, an established businessman and owner of what is now Leak &amp;amp; Sons Funeral Homes, who provided an apartment for the young Jacksons to live in as they got their footing in their new town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[The Leaks] said, ‘We've got a nice building, and we live in it,’ ” Santita Jackson said. “They helped [my parents] to establish a line of credit so they could buy furniture, and they carpeted the apartment so the children could roll around and play all we wanted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The families would stay close friends and neighbors in South Shore for years to come, with their children becoming like brothers and sisters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spencer Leak Jr., now 56, recalled playing basketball with the Jackson boys in the driveway and having dinner with the family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No politics [were] brought up; it was just all laughing and joking like a family,” Leak said. “The public knows Reverend Jackson as this civil rights leader.

Clay Evans, founder of Fellowship church, pulled her father over and said “I’m not gonna let you stand in this line.” After that day, Evans and the church made sure the family had groceries each week, and that the young parents had the best babysitters the congregation could offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another pastor, Rev. James Bevel, vouched for Jesse Jackson to lead Martin Luther King Jr.’s Operation Breadbasket — which would quickly elevate Jackson in the civil rights movement and lay the foundation for what later became Rainbow PUSH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev. Martin Deppe, a United Methodist Church pastor who worked on Operation Breadbasket, would also remain a close friend of Jackson’s. He recounted to WBEZ about the first time he saw the captivating leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He came in, and like wildfire, within two or three weeks, he was running the meeting,” Deppe said. “His charisma [and] strengths were so, so evident that the leading Black pastors yielded the gavel to him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deppe said Chicago’s pastors embraced the magnetic Jackson, mentoring him and connecting him to other powerful businessmen and city leaders — especially as Operation Breadbasket began attracting thousands of members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Jackson] didn’t start out in politics, he started out in the church,” said Deppe, author of “Operation Breadbasket: An Untold Story of Civil Rights in Chicago, 1966-1971.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Jackson’s star rose in the 1970s and 80s, Chicago’s pastoral community provided spiritual guidance. Evans, who had pulled Jackson out of the bread line decades earlier, would remain a mentor and close confidante, according to Rev. James Meeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reverend Clay Evans was the pastor of this family until his death” in 2019, Meeks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-aa0000\" name=\"image-aa0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/efdd0d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7699x4321+0+407/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F70%2F76%2Fd68d941243558f2e81d2acb67719%2Fimg-9339.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/432af8b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7699x4321+0+407/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F70%2F76%2Fd68d941243558f2e81d2acb67719%2Fimg-9339.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/13426cb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7699x4321+0+407/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F70%2F76%2Fd68d941243558f2e81d2acb67719%2Fimg-9339.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Martin L.

That’s how important the community is to us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santita Jackson said she “couldn’t ask for more” from her hometown. “It sent two of my brothers [Jesse Jr. and Jonathan] to Congress, it’s given me a wonderful career in radio,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked whether her father ever considered moving to another city, she scoffed, adding that Chicago was the only place her father could do the work he did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is a town that is full of strivers, of people who really came here to grow: Blacks who had been chased out of the South, refugees and immigrants looking for opportunities,” she continued, remembering the young couple that drove through downtown Chicago on that day in 1964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: “Go elsewhere for what? There is no place like Chicago, and it is our home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contributing: Somer Van Benton&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

It torments opponents with its high-pressure approach and leads the NHL with an 85.7% kill rate. And that's with just four men on the ice, so why not do the same with five during even-strength play?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I’ve said it lots of times: we have really good killers. But those same guys are on the ice five-on-five,\" Blashill said Wednesday. \"If you can dictate where the puck’s going, you have a better chance of [dialing up] pressure. If you can’t dictate where the puck’s going, you can’t pressure it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"On our penalty kill, we’ve done a good job of dictating and reading those pressure points. We’ve [also] done a good job on the penalty kill of knowing when to reset and protect the middle. Those two things are going to be important for us in the 'D'-zone [system], as well.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This season, the Hawks are using a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2025/09/27/blackhawks-jeff-blashill-defensive-systems-penalty-kill-nhl-hockey-strategy\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;hybrid defensive-zone system&lt;/a&gt;: zone defense down low, man-on-man defense elsewhere. The past couple years, they played entirely zone defense. That man-on-man element means, for example, their defensemen sometimes have to follow opposing forwards all the way up toward the blue line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest change Wednesday is that their strong-side wingers will now be more aggressive pressuring the puck along the boards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the Hawks' strong-side defenseman would pressure the puck, and the winger would hang back and read off of the defenseman. Now, the strong-side winger will pressure the puck-carrier no matter what, and if the defenseman reads that the winger has him properly covered, he can drop back to guard or box out around the crease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"[The winger] doesn't need to make a read anymore: 'Does this guy have space? Is my 'D'-man going downhill, or is he going to the inside?'\" forward Jason Dickinson said. \"[Those were] different reads he had to make in those situations. Now it's just pressure. You create the pressure; then everybody else will react off of that. That's the biggest change.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This adjustment will force Hawks' centers to make more reads and think harder when they come out of the corners, and it also necessitates more coverage handoffs that could momentarily leave opposing players open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it should generally reduce the workload placed upon the Hawks' defensive corps — an extremely young unit that sagged under that heavy weight in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Our 'D'-men won't have to climb high as often,\" Dickinson added. \"It'll still happen where we'll be like, 'Hey, you &lt;i&gt;have&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;to go with this guy.' But more often than not, they should be able to retreat back to the net because our winger will be striking that guy, and then our center will be able to come out from underneath.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;I’m back in Chicago for the Blackhawks’ first official practice back in action: &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/YI4hDj6z64\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YI4hDj6z64&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ben Pope (@BenPopeCST) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenPopeCST/status/2024167029985456324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 18, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks had their AHL affiliate in Rockford test out this altered system during back-to-back games last weekend, producing video clips for the Hawks to review and analyze this week. Blashill has tried to keep his and Rockford coach Jared Nightingale's systems in sync as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the Hawks called up Sam Rinzel and Kevin Korchinski from Rockford, giving them seven healthy defensemen even with Wyatt Kaiser expected to miss time due to a lower-body injury suffered in the final game before the Olympic break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enigmatic rookie Artyom Levshunov's individual development program continues, and he skated as the seventh defenseman in practice Wednesday. But Blashill said the lineup for next Thursday at the Predators won't be determined for a while yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The Hawks will have only 41 home games again next season — despite the regular season extending to 84 games — because they've been selected for an undisclosed NHL \"special event.\" That suggests a Europe trip, which would be the Hawks' first since they visited Berlin and Prague in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 41 home games, season-ticket prices will rise by a modest average of 2%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Connor Bedard has resumed taking his own faceoffs, allowing Frank Nazar to move back to his own line. On Wednesday, Bedard centered Ryan Greene and Andre Burakovsky, and Nazar centered Oliver Moore and Tyler Bertuzzi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Kaiser and Teuvo Teravainen, who advanced to the Olympic semifinals with Finland, were the only players absent from practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Prospect goalie Stan Berezhnoy, who has made 15 appearances for Rockford this season, has been suspended for 20 games by the AHL for testing positive for a prohibited substance (Rockford has 23 games left in their season). General manager Kyle Davidson said in a statement the Hawks were informed last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"While Stanislav did not knowingly take a prohibited substance, we believe his positive test is a result of a supplement he was consuming at the time,\" Davidson said. \"Stanislav has taken full responsibility for the situation, and the organization praises him for the maturity and accountability he has shown.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-890005\" name=\"list-890005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, pagination=[{body=[Next Page], href=?p=2, _template=/link/Link.hbs, contentId=null, pianoSectionSlug=null, target=null}], bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, anchorId=list-890005, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, _styledTemplate=/page/list/PageListH.hbs, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, carouselSpeed=null, buttonHoverBgColor=#a91d23, rteHeadingFont=font-1, secondaryColor=#656565, hideCategories=true, _template=/page/list/includes/PageList-header.hbs, font3=Arial, font4=Source-serif-4, ctaUrl=null, hideImage=false, suppressPagination=true, footerLinkHoverColor=#d3242c, hideAudioPlayback=false, description=[], showSecondItemMedia=false, listColumns234=null, footerTextColor=#ffffff, headerSecondaryBgColor=#000000, primaryTextColorInverse=#ffffff, titleColor=null, title=Latest on the Blackhawks, ampLink=null, listHeaderPosition=null, hideDescriptions=false, showActionBar=true, linkHoverColor=#d3242c, buttonBgColor=#d3242c, ctaTarget=null, count=8137, promoButtonText=null, pullQuoteIcon=[{image=null, narrowImage=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=null}], backgroundColor=null, headerSecondaryTextColor=#ffffff, listTitleFont=font-2, headlineFont=font-1, promoDescriptionFont=font-3, primaryColor=#d3242c, items=[{type=Image, category=[{items=[Blackhawks]}], categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks, _styledTemplate=null, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/02/17/blackhawks-storylines-nhl-trade-deadline-artyom-levshunov-anton-frondell, imageAlignment=null, publishDate=February 17, 2026 06:30 AM, target=null, primaryMediaType=null, isFeatured=true, title=Five storylines to follow during the final third of the Blackhawks&amp;#x27;

Louis Cameli instaba a los congregantes a abrazar el arrepentimiento.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estas cenizas representan un abrazo al arrepentimiento, a la conversión, un cambio de corazón, recalibrar nuestras vidas para que puedan estar más en conformidad con lo que Dios quiere”, predicó Cameli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-ae0000\" name=\"module-ae0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Miércoles de Ceniza marca el inicio de la Cuaresma, un periodo de 40 días de reflexión, oración, ayuno y donación a los necesitados, según la Conferencia de Obispos Católicos de los Estados Unidos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generalmente, se requiere que los católicos de entre 18 y 59 años ayunen. Durante el ayuno, una persona puede comer una comida completa, así como dos comidas más pequeñas. También es tradición abstenerse de comer carne los viernes durante la Cuaresma —y en el Miércoles de Ceniza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bridget O'Brien, directora de ministerio en la Iglesia Católica de Old St. Patrick, destacó que el ayuno es para “hacernos conscientes de nuestra hambre de Dios”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Me ayuda a reflexionar sobre el hecho de que un día moriré y reflexionar sobre la vida que quiero llevar”, dijo O'Brien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Dowling, un residente de River North de 59 años que ha asistido a la Catedral del Santo Nombre durante aproximadamente cuatro años, espera hacerse “más firme en la oración”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Quiero renunciar a algunas cosas de mi vida a las que estoy apegado [y asegurarme] de que estoy aferrado a Dios”, dijo Dowling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los observadores del Miércoles de Ceniza eligen algo placentero —generalmente una comida favorita o algún vicio placentero— para sacrificar durante el periodo de 40 días.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janett Diaz espera utilizar la Cuaresma como una oportunidad para renunciar a cosas terrenales. Diaz, quien está de visita en Chicago desde Panamá, hizo de su prioridad asistir a la Misa del Miércoles de Ceniza mientras estaba en el extranjero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Para mí, se trata de hacer menos compras y quizás un poco menos de tiempo frente a la pantalla y un poco menos de orgullo”, dijo Diaz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al igual que Diaz, la residente de Albany Park, Ana Pizzaro, desea acercarse más a Dios y planea usar la Cuaresma como una herramienta motivacional para establecer una mejor disciplina religiosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vine del polvo, y un día cuando muera, volveré a ser polvo. Así que necesitamos recordar que Dios es quien nos creó y que una vez que vivamos nuestras vidas, regresaremos a Él”, dijo Pizzaro, de 49 años. “Me gusta venir a misa todos los días, pero necesito encontrar una manera de llegar a tiempo. Y, por supuesto, rezaré más”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los observadores instaron a cualquiera interesado en aprender más sobre el Miércoles de Ceniza a visitar su iglesia local en persona y ser parte de la comunidad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Incluso si comienzas sentándote en la última fila y al menos escuchas lo que está sucediendo en la iglesia [y] en la misa, eso te ayuda a empezar”, dijo Pizzaro. “Ese sería un buen paso para empezar a buscar a Dios”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Brien se sintió “muy conmovida” por los niveles de diversidad que ha visto en los congregantes de la iglesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tienes hombres con lodo en sus botas y cascos que vienen de un sitio de construcción, tienes enfermeras en uniforme, personas en trajes muy elegantes... solo un recordatorio de la hermandad y la fraternidad y de que todos se unen porque este es un inicio significativo para ellos”, dijo O'Brien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        &lt;bsp-carousel class=\"Carousel Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"gallery-920001\" name=\"gallery-920001\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slides\"&gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slide\"&gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-media\"&gt;\n        \n            \n                \n                    &lt;picture data-crop=\"large\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0ff7ee0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6883x4548+0+22/resize/840x555!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2F77%2F130ecfbc4afabbdd408e32501c61%2Fashwednesday-260219-04.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c03993/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6883x4548+0+22/resize/1680x1110!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2F77%2F130ecfbc4afabbdd408e32501c61%2Fashwednesday-260219-04.jpg 2x\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/411433a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6883x4548+0+22/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2F77%2F130ecfbc4afabbdd408e32501c61%2Fashwednesday-260219-04.jpg\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"ASHWEDNESDAY_260219-04.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/411433a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6883x4548+0+22/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2F77%2F130ecfbc4afabbdd408e32501c61%2Fashwednesday-260219-04.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fb02eb1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6883x4548+0+22/resize/1680x1110!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2F77%2F130ecfbc4afabbdd408e32501c61%2Fashwednesday-260219-04.jpg 2x\" width=\"840\" height=\"555\"\n        src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/411433a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6883x4548+0+22/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2F77%2F130ecfbc4afabbdd408e32501c61%2Fashwednesday-260219-04.jpg\"&gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n                \n            \n        \n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-info\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-infoTitle\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-infoDescription\"&gt;A congregant prays after receiving the imposition of ashes at Holy Name Cathedral on Ash Wednesday.&lt;/span&gt;\n            \n            \n                &lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-pipe\"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-infoAttribution\"&gt;Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-pagination\"&gt;\n            &lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-currentSlide\"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

Las condiciones climáticas, que incluyen baja humedad en el aire y una reciente falta de lluvia y nieve, también pueden llevar a un mayor riesgo de propagación rápida de incendios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La vigilancia del clima de incendios estará vigente hasta la noche del miércoles en gran parte del norte de Illinois, incluyendo los condados de Cook, Lake, DeKalb y DuPage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-c70000\" name=\"module-c70000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;https://x.com/NWSChicago/status/2023866207443513784&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El NWS recomienda no quemar desechos de jardín debido a la posibilidad de que los incendios se propaguen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Está calentándose, estoy seguro de que muchas personas se sentirán tentadas a quemar desechos de jardín”, dijo el meteorólogo del NWS, Kevin Doom. “Quizás deberían evitarlo, pero si lo hacen, sólo mantengan un ojo... puede ser muy fácil que una chispa se suelte y encienda algo más”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los peligros climáticos de incendios son más comunes en otoño y primavera, aunque pueden ocurrir en cualquier época del año, advirtió Doom. También instó a las personas a tener cuidado al desechar materiales en combustión como colillas de cigarrillos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago estableció un récord de &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/weather/2026/02/16/chicago-forecast-warm-weather-record-high-temperature-monday\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;temperatura&lt;/a&gt; máxima el lunes, ya que la ciudad registró un día de 65 grados.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
