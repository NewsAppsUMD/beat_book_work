Grand Ave., will bring \"the IKEA experience closer to where people live, work, socialize and shop — just in a smaller footprint,\" a company spokesperson said, who added that the store is expected to open in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s part of the company’s larger goal of opening 10 stores during the 2026 fiscal year, including in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Fort Collins, Colorado, and Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known for its massive stores, the smaller-format site in Gurnee will be about 66,000 square feet, according to a news release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers will have the chance to shop from a curated selection of 3,000 items, including home furnishings, accessories and small furniture items.&amp;nbsp;There will also be a centralized \"planning area,\" where customers can meet with IKEA's design consultants. And like it's larger warehouse locations, it'll serve its famous Swedish meatballs, as well as hot dogs and cinnamon buns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gurnee store joins IKEA's other locations in Bolingbrook and Schaumburg. IKEA's nearly 310,000-square-foot Bolingbrook store opened in 2005. Schaumburg's location, at over 400,000 square feet, opened in 1998, and at the time, was the company's largest store in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, IKEA opened 14 retail locations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[2025] was a year of meaningful connection and growth despite a challenging external environment,” Rob Olson, interim CEO of IKEA U.S., said in a news release. “Looking ahead to [fiscal year 2026], we will build on this momentum, focusing on continued investment in the U.S. to make IKEA more affordable, accessible and sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;",

There isn’t any point in spending time reading and listening about how good everyone thinks the Redwings are this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are just trying to stay within ourselves and not put pressure on ourselves and have fun,” Wright said. “We are trying our best to tune it out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is going to get a lot harder for Wright and his teammates over the next week. The &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/02/15/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;top-ranked &lt;/a&gt;Redwings are playing the best basketball the area has seen since Glenbard West in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benet knocked off No. 11 Marist 77-68 on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/17/chicago-high-school-basketball-scores-illinois\"   &gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago to win the East Suburban Catholic Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are better than I even thought,” RedHawks coach Brian Hynes said. “They have so many weapons. Our kids played hard. They are the best in the state and hopefully we can see them again in Champaign.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright scored 17 points and 7-1 senior Colin Stack led with 23 points and seven rebounds. Ed Stasys, a 6-8 junior, added 16 points and 12 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High school guards often have trouble feeding big men in the post. That’s not a problem for Benet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every single year our chemistry has gotten better,” Wright said. “Especially now. I feel like I know right where [Stack] is going to be, and I can throw it up for him to dunk it. We have grown a really great connection over these three years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stack’s dunk at the second quarter buzzer gave Benet a 35-33 lead at halftime. The Redwings (29-1, 8-0) opened the second half with a 13-1 burst to take control of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marist senior Charles Barnes Jr. scored 22 points in the second half and finished with 33. Barnes made three three-pointers in the final two minutes to keep the RedHawks (25-5, 5-2) within striking distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s a great player,” Benet coach Gene Heidkamp said. “He is everything we thought he was. And he never quits. He keeps going. Luckily, we made enough plays on the offensive end to have a buffer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright, an Eastern Illinois recruit, has a unique combination of stability and creativity as a point guard. He’s a handful for defenses to worry about all on his own and this season he has two skilled big men to utilize and several talented guards around him, including 6-5 junior Perry Tchiegne (seven points) and 6-3 Ethan Mac Dermot (14 points).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Stasys] changes the game in a lot of ways people don’t realize,” Stack said. “He has such a great motor, and he defends at a high level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-640000\" name=\"image-640000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91cb648/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a1f30c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91f6c2f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Benet&amp;#x27;s Jayden Wright (3) feels good about the Redwings victory over Marist.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91f6c2f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e94548b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91f6c2f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fea%2Ff6efeae7478490e26f22d73bbbcd%2Fob-cst-021826-7002.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benet’s Jayden Wright (3) feels good about the Redwings victory over Marist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior Kendall Meyers finished with 17 points and seven rebounds for Marist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is nice to have a kid like Barnes that can hit it from the volleyball line three times late in the game when you are down,” Hynes said. “The problem for us is our best games are more balanced scoring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benet is the top seed in the Class 4A Bolingbrook Sectional and the overwhelming favorite to repeat as state champions. But Heidkamp has seen the big favorite lose many times. It happened to him before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know how hard it is to win a state title,” Heidkamp said. “Last year we had five losses and we were the three seed in the sectinal and we won the state championship. You have to be ready for every game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the last year of the ESCC, which is merging with the Catholic League next season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is pretty emotional,” Heidkamp said. “I coached in this league for 33 years. I played in this league. It is the only league I have ever known. I was disappointed when the decision was made [to merge].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I’m really proud of our kids. This was a good way to end it if it had to end. We had to beat St. Pat’s at St. Pat’s and Marist at Marist. Our kids showed a lot of heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-200000\" name=\"html-embed-module-200000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"No Shot Clock, Ep. 202: Breaking down the 3A and 4A state championship contenders\" allowtransparency=\"true\" height=\"150\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);height:150px;\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=2i5vy-1a4a779-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=auto&amp;logo_link=episode_page&amp;btn-skin=c73a3a\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Jesse Louis Jackson was missed by those of us who wanted or needed someone to lead us through these troubled times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a third of the 20th century and more than a decade of this 21st one, the civil rights activist, politician and ordained Baptist minister was camera ready, omnipresent and immanently quotable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was cherished by most Black Americans and vilified by many white Americans. Over the half century I have known  Jackson, I’ve not fallen into either camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a professional journalist who has written a signed op-ed page column for the Chicago Tribune and later for the Chicago Sun-Times; hosted the TV show “Common Ground”; and worked as the editor of a Black Chicago newspaper, there have been times when we got along just fine, and at other times, not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-880000\" name=\"module-880000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were times when my reporting was not to the good reverend’s liking, and he let me know. There were times when what I wrote he thought was right on the mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 1973, I was an assistant editor at Ebony magazine. I was assigned to interview Jackson about “Save the Children,” a movie about the PUSH exposition, featuring the Jackson 5, Marvin Gaye and Bill Withers. The reverend kept me waiting for 45 minutes, then answered my questions in words that rhymed and quipped but were not particularly detailed. I called him out on it. He stood up, then left the room. Fifteen minutes later, I realized I had all I was getting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight years later, as a Tribune reporter, every week I covered his Saturday morning meeting at Operation PUSH. Each week, when he wasn’t in some other city or town, fighting for a racial injustice that he was eager to take on, he’d have some prominent figure as his guest, following it up by the sermon of the week on something white people were doing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could bet your bottom dollar that the meetings would feature Jackson’s “I Am Somebody” chorus chant and his well-staged contributions method with two or three businessmen in the audience volunteering to contribute $500 to the cause, followed by lesser pledges immediately before the ushers circulated the collection plates from one row to the next being filled with dollar bills featuring various dead presidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson was a master of the media. He could be called on to confront an editor or news operation where a Black journalist had been fired just because or when that newsroom was obviously a place for whites only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Jackson and Black journalists was often a two-way street. There was the time that Jackson was on a radio show with Derek Hill and one of the callers suggested Black Chicagoans should boycott ChicagoFest because Mayor Jane Byrne appointed whites to the Chicago Housing Authority board, ignoring Black representation. The civil rights leader took up the cause right then and there. The next day I ran into him with Gary Mayor Richard Hatcher while the two were heading into a meeting for Black mayors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked about the instant boycott. Jackson said he was kicking it off because Chicago’s Black voters were being disrespected. I pointed out to Jackson that Stevie Wonder was the marquee attraction at the event on one given day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Have you talked to Stevie?” I asked. “You could have 5,000 protesters out front, and there will be 10,000 Blacks trying to get in to see him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson had a stunned look on his face. It was obvious that was something he hadn’t considered. He told me he didn’t want to reveal all his plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later it was announced that Stevie would not be appearing at ChicagoFest for safety’s sake. The boycott was a huge success, and it was a crucial step in leading to Chicago electing its first Black mayor, Harold Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later, Jackson would take another step. He’d mount a serious attempt at America having a Black president. His first effort didn’t work. Nor did his second one in 1988. But it turned out to be a powerful demonstration that a Black man could get to the White House.  When Barack Obama followed Jackson’s lead 20 years later, becoming America’s first Black president, the civil rights leader witnessed hope not only being kept, but that it had come alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-de0000\" name=\"module-de0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Asked about that strong finish — which included five home runs in the last four games of the regular season and another to open the postseason — he was far more interested in discussing ways he could improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wasn’t satisfied with the season last year,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He zeroed in on his contact rate, which he wants to keep higher, even when he’s hitting for slug. His batting average dropped to .245 as he launched 32 home runs, surpassing his previous career high by 11. At times, he said, there was a disconnect between how his swing felt and what it looked like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I spent some time in the offseason trying to get better at those things,” he said. “Looking back, it’s probably one of the best offseasons I’ve had.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the final year of the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2022/3/16/22980856/cubs-seiya-suzuki-japanese-outfielder\"   &gt;five-year, $85 million contract Suzuki signed in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, when he transitioned to MLB and the Cubs from Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball. As of Monday, the Cubs had not initiated extension talks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Signing with the team, people expect something from me,” he said. “I felt like I haven’t really reached those [expectations] yet. So I think I just need to continue to work on myself and make sure I can repay the team and the fans, and just go out and have a good season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Suzuki first signed, the Cubs talked about him as a player they could grow with, and vice versa. That’s essentially how his first four years in the U.S. have played out. Last year, for the first time, teammates and fans got to see him in the postseason, where he was one of the Cubs’ best offensive performers, along with Michael Busch and Nico Hoerner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s such a talented hitter,” left fielder Ian Happ said. “His swing is beautiful, but his ability to just impact the baseball is really special. That’s in there, and it’s in there all the time. . . . He’s a huge force for us in the lineup.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2023/2/28/23619152/cubs-seiya-suzuki-diagnosed-with-moderate-oblique-strain-opening-day-wbc-team-japan\"   &gt;After missing the 2023 WBC&lt;/a&gt; with an oblique injury, he’s now set to enter the regular season riding the momentum of a WBC run for the first time. Team Japan, the reigning champion, is expected to go far. That’s not guaranteed to kick-start Suzuki’s season with the Cubs, but he showed in the playoffs last year that he has a knack for rising to the occasion in these sorts of settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just fun being in that mode,” manager Craig Counsell said. “That’s why WBC is so attractive. October is like, ‘Just give me more’ — that’s what everybody feels when you go through it. So that’s why the guys love the WBC, because it gives them that if you can get to the right games.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Suzuki’s usual position is right field, he confirmed he’ll slide over to center for Team Japan. In preparation, he’s set to play center for the Cubs on Friday and Sunday as they open Cactus League play. He leaves Monday to join his national team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No worries there,” Suzuki said. “I feel like I’ve been moving well. That’s something I worked on in the offseason. And getting those reps in, I think that’s going to be beneficial for me in the season, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grinning, he added: “If Pete wants an off day or something, that’s my chance to play center field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, items=[{type=Image, category=[{items=[MLB]}], _styledTemplate=null, description=[{items=[Clark stepped down after an internal investigation into an “inappropriate” relationship with his sister-in-law, who had been hired by the union in 2023, according to an ESPN report.]}], imageAlignment=null, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb, isFeatured=false, wordCount=173, authors=[{bio=[{items=[USA Today is a multi-platform news and information media company that prints across the United States and internationally.

I have had many relationships (some good, some bad). Although in the past I experienced heartbreaks, I am now open to meeting someone new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently ended a relationship with \"Bill,\" a man I met at a resort casino three years ago. I was happy in the beginning, until things started to take a turn. Because we go to the same places all the time, it was hard to break it off. I tried, but Bill would run back to me, and I always took him back, mostly because I felt guilty for hurting him. I finally ended things for good four months ago, after he did something very rude. A neighbor later told me that Bill was stalking me. Bill denies this, even though I have proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby, I am writing because, for some reason, I'm still drawn to him. He's the only man in my life who ever told me he loves me. I'm afraid no one will ever love me the way he does. I know the stalking is a sign that he is mentally unwell, yet we keep bumping into each other, which has caused this pull to want to be with him. I can't afford therapy right now, so any advice you can give me to move beyond this \"pull\" I have for him would be appreciated. — &lt;i&gt;HEART RULING THE HEAD&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR HEART:&lt;/b&gt; Honey, if you no longer frequent the places you used to frequent together and keep running into him anyway, has it occurred to you that it's happening BECAUSE HE'S STILL STALKING YOU? If you're still going to the same places, it's time to change your routine. This troubled individual may be the only person who has said \"I love you,\" but he won't be the last if you open yourself to other relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You say you can't afford therapy, but please be aware that free or low-cost counseling is available from your county's department of mental health services or a local college or university with a psychology department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; I've been talking to a famous pro wrestler who is having marriage problems. He has been hitting on me through Google Chat. I just want to be a supportive friend whom he can vent to. He says his wife \"is getting too old for him,\" if you know what I mean. They have a joint bank account, but he says it's frozen. He has asked me for an Apple card. I told him no and to ask his extended family instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abby, I need my money to help out my brothers and sister. I'd prefer he be like a friend or big brother to me. I need major advice, please, because it feels like my life is going out of control. — &lt;i&gt;UNCERTAIN IN IDAHO&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR UNCERTAIN:&lt;/b&gt; People must exercise caution when communicating with strangers online. \"Famous pro wrestlers\" usually have enough money that they aren't reduced to hitting up women they meet on the internet for Apple cards. Your life will not \"go out of control\" unless you allow it to. Regain control by ghosting and blocking this person. He's a scammer, and he, not you, should figure out his own financial problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

The administration’s decision equates to deliberately harming Americans by intentionally exposing people to known toxins. I am outraged at the wanton disregard for the scientific and medical knowledge that enables the advancement of society and allows people to live longer and better lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our hospitals and clinics, we see the consequences of poor air quality, extreme heat and severe weather events every day. There is a mental toll that we all suffer when dealing with loss from a flood or caring for a child who develops asthma. And these are just a few examples of the known consequences of ignoring decades of science and medical evidence showing that greenhouse gas pollution is a danger to our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Illinois alone, this decision could amount to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://library.edf.org/AssetLink/8185q63d8o5k72s2665rx4jtd1nfxb37.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;$29 billion dollars&lt;/a&gt; in health harms in the next 30 years, according to an analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund. Illinoisans stand to suffer some of the greatest health harms being one of the five of the most impacted states. This will mean premature deaths, asthma attacks, emergency room and hospital admissions and lost days of school and work. For the United States, the human toll could reach up to $500 billion. This is not the kind of legacy that leads to greatness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decision prioritizes industry profits over the health of the American people. Our patients, families, and communities are paying the cost while polluters are shielded from accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a doctor, it is my job to let patients know when something is harmful to their health. The repeal of the endangerment finding is a great harm to our health. Our leaders, this administration, and polluters should be held accountable.

This is a common misperception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal program does not take money away from public schools, but is in addition to Title I and other federal programs. While many public school advocates oppose this type of federal legislation, the plain fact of the matter is that it exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Gov. JB Pritzker does not endorse the federal tax-credit scholarship program, it only means that Illinois children and parents will lose millions of dollars in educational aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a fundamental misunderstanding of the economic impact and the tax burden of parents sending children to private schools that should be understood. The existence of private schools actually permits higher levels of public school funding on a per-student basis than would be sustainable without them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every parent of a private school child is, in effect, subsidizing the public school system and the taxpayers of Illinois, not the reverse. Each parent of a private school child provides the same funding to the public school system as does a parent of a child in the public school system but, in addition, pays tuition on top of that for the private school system, thus not burdening public schools with the expense of educating their child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chicago Public Schools, the operating expense per student per year is over $20,000 and the total expense is almost $30,000. Consequently, private school parents save taxpayers millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the private school system in Chicago were to shut down, it would cause about a billion dollars additional cost to the taxpayers of Chicago to absorb the private school population, without any additional revenue from real estate taxes and would almost certainly necessitate a significant increase in tax rates. Given the already tenuous financial position and the ongoing closure of private schools, public policy should encourage Illinois government to make the most of every opportunity to bring in new federal dollars to keep private schools open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker’s responsibility is to all citizens of Illinois, both those who favor public schools and those who enroll their children in private schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charles W.

I learned this as a Chicago police officer, and I teach it now as a criminal justice professor: Trust takes decades to build and moments to destroy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents stand where local police departments stood decades ago. They can learn from our mistakes or repeat them on a national scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning signs are flashing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Halloween festivities last fall, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/26/northwest-side-ice-arrests-tear-gas\"   &gt;federal agents deployed tear gas&lt;/a&gt; before a party in Chicago's Old Irving Park neighborhood, forcing the cancellation of a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://blockclubchicago.org/2025/10/28/after-halloween-parade-ruined-by-federal-agents-old-irving-park-neighbors-furious/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;children’s Halloween parade&lt;/a&gt;.

American citizens felt they needed protected zones for their children because they feared federal law enforcement operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-990000\" name=\"module-990000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Commentary bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commentary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When 33rd Ward Ald. Rossana Rodriguez Sanchez checked on her constituents, witnesses reported &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://abc7chicago.com/post/ice-chicago-news-federal-agents-detain-people-irving-park-albany-push-ald-rossana-rodriguez-sanchez-halloween-2025/18096451/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;agents pushing her&lt;/a&gt;. In Evanston, federal agents allegedly caused &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://abc7chicago.com/post/ice-evanston-today-news-cook-county-officials-speak-federal-immigration-agents-reportedly-area-halloween/18095995/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;a crash near an elementary school&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this brings to mind rogue tactics of the past deployed by police departments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In New York City, stop-and-frisk policies saw police stopping nearly &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/fact-sheet-stop-and-frisks-effect-crime-new-york-city\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;700,000 people in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nyclu.org/data/stop-and-frisk-data\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;88% resulting in no arrest&lt;/a&gt;.  The policy was eventually ruled &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://eji.org/news/new-york-crime-falls-as-police-end-stop-and-frisk/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;, but a generation of young men grew up viewing every police interaction with suspicion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, former Police Commander &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicagotorturejustice.org/history\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Jon Burge&lt;/a&gt; and officers under his command tortured more than 100 suspects between 1972 and 1991. Children who watched their fathers handcuffed grew into adults who won't call 911 when they hear gunshots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those heinous acts cast a shadow over legitimate police work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once arrested a domestic batterer who became verbally aggressive. His young son watched as I handcuffed his father. That little boy looked at me and said, \"When I grow up, I'm going to kill you for locking up my father.\" This was a necessary arrest, but that child only understood that a man with a badge took his father away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a legitimate arrest can create that resentment, imagine the impact when families are separated during a children's holiday. These children will remember the Halloween when federal agents made their parents too afraid to let them trick-or-treat. That's how generational distrust is built; one traumatic memory at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My students from Chicago neighborhoods describe what this looks like. One reports hearing constant helicopter surveillance. Another student, born in Syria, shared something troubling: the atmosphere reminds him of the fear he experienced back home — helicopters, uncertainty, the sense that violence could erupt at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a young man who fled a war zone says federal operations in Chicago feel similar to what he escaped, every federal law enforcement professional should pause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Enforce laws professionally&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;ICE and Border Patrol have legitimate mandates to enforce immigration law. The question isn't whether they should enforce the law; they absolutely should. The question is whether they'll learn from local law enforcement's mistakes about how enforcement is conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can arrest someone without traumatizing their children. You can execute a warrant without turning a neighborhood into a war zone. Professional law enforcement transcends politics because the principles of proportional force, constitutional rights and community trust aren't partisan issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When federal agents deployed tear gas during Halloween weekend and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem rejected Gov. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/29/gov-pritzker-letter-kristi-noem-ice-enforcement-pause-chicago-halloween\"   &gt;JB Pritzker’s request &lt;/a&gt;to pause enforcement operations around schools during the holiday, they sent a clear message about priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal immigration enforcement agencies don't have to repeat police departments' mistakes. Police departments that rebuilt trust did so by fundamentally changing their approach, training officers in de-escalation, emphasizing procedural justice and holding officers accountable when they crossed lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child who watches a harsh immigration enforcement operation today will be a voting adult in a few years and a parent in a decade. The lessons children learn now about whether law enforcement treats people with dignity will shape their attitudes toward all authority figures for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It goes back to communities having long memories. Local police learned this lesson the hard way, spending decades trying to rebuild trust. Federal immigration enforcement doesn't have to make the same mistakes, but they have to be willing to listen to those of us who've lived through the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Louis Martinez is a professor of law enforcement at Oakton College's Des Plaines campus and a former Chicago police officer. He has written about law enforcement issues for nearly two decades.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-820000\" name=\"module-820000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

There’s these Chinese red lanterns hanging in there with a bunch of my grandparents’ furniture that I revamped to fit the space. It has a Shanghai kind of vibe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diners might remember it as The Ladies’ Room, formerly owned by the Fat Rice team of which Lo was a part.

Its footprint is tiny and diners will be seated at tables of two and four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re offering a tasting menu that represents prosperity, wealth, good fortune and long life as we head into the new lunar cycle,” said Lo. “We’ll have dumplings, which are associated with wealth due to their shape as a money bag. Spring rolls symbolize gold bars. Long noodles signify long life, so that’s where the stir-fried noodles come in. These are dishes you traditionally see on Lunar New Year menus. &lt;i&gt;Yusheng, &lt;/i&gt;also known as the ‘prosperity’ salad, will also be served.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dish is made of shaved vegetables, sometimes slivers of seafood are included (not for the dinner at Third Bird) and topped with slices of citrus fruits like oranges. The bright, seasonal fruit is a sign of good luck and is synonymous with the holiday. Guests dining at Lo’s restaurant will be asked to dress the plated salad and toss the ingredients together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The belief is, the higher you toss it, the more prosperous a year it will be,” Lo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialty menu, in celebration of the Year of the Horse, is available for two nights only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lo points out how she has done specialty Lunar New Year events throughout the years but after exploring who she is and growing into her career, this dinner might be one of the most meaningful yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being Chinese American, as a younger kid, [my culture] wasn’t something I was really into. As I've gotten older, that’s changed. It's been really exciting. I love who I am, where I came from, who my grandparents are and what we're about.

Montgomery, the city of Chicago’s first Black corporation counsel, was presented Tuesday with his ancestral roots by Henry Louis Gates Jr., host of PBS’ “Finding Your Roots.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a 94th birthday present, Gates gifted Montgomery his “Book of Life,” a detailed account of Montgomery’s lineage on both sides of his family back to his third great-grandparents. The work was prepared by American Ancestors, a family history nonprofit based in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was more than I knew,” Montgomery said. “You know, I’ve learned that these people were industrious and landowners. And that gives me a sense of self-esteem and pride.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reveal was hosted Tuesday by Trinity United Church of Christ, where Montgomery is a charter member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery was born in Louise, Mississippi, and thought that was as far as his roots went. But he learned that his ancestors have origins on plantations in Maryland, Virginia, and South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using an 1844 probate record document, it was determined Montgomery’s paternal third great-grandmother, Rosetta Guster, who was born in1807, his paternal second great-grandmother, Luvinia Guster, who was born in 1825, and three other relatives were recorded as property of George Fisher in Yazoo County, Mississippi. The record detailed what was to happen to his property after his death, which in this case, Montgomery's ancestors were guaranteed to Burwell Boykin, a prosperous slave owner with plantations across the South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates surmised that the agreement between Fisher and Boykin could stem from a few possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fisher may have owed Boykin a debt, and they were property, and your ancestors were used to repay that debt,” Gates said. “It’s also possible that Boykin had loaned or leased your ancestors to Fisher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates went on to ask Montgomery how it felt to know that his flesh and blood were \"passed around between two white slave owners, like farm animals, or farm equipment?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without hesitation, Montgomery responded: “Angry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Finding Your Roots” host took Montgomery through the same process he’s done with celebrities on television. Asking them questions about their skills and talents to possibly trace those same skills and talents back to their ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After coming to Chicago in 1937, Montgomery enrolled in Fuller Elementary and then went on to Phillips High School. Montgomery said his white guidance counselor attempted to dissuade him from going to college, suggesting that it would be too difficult. He went on to earn his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Highlights of his law career include: becoming the first African American to serve as the city’s top lawyer, under Mayor Harold Washington; filing a class-action lawsuit against the Chicago Board Education, in 1961, claiming that the board deliberately created segregated schools; and serving as the attorney of record for Fred Hampton, the activist and leader of the Illinois chapter of the national Black Panther Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates said that Montgomery could trace the origins of his successful career to the entrepreneurial spirit of his ancestors. In Montgomery’s “Book of Life,” Gates included loan agreements between his ancestors and the Lintonia Building and Loan Association, where his maternal second great-grandparents, Alex and Patsy Oliver, took out a $600 loan and $200 worth of supplies, and put up 50 acres of their land as collateral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That Alex and Patsy, by 1899, already owned land, let me tell you this: This would have been, that was huge,” Gates said. “That was very rare for Black people to own land, particularly in Mississippi.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery said his family still owns that land of 200 acres, and that once a year, he and his family members get between $10 and $50 for leasing the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was only a partial ancestral reveal due to time constraints. Montgomery will have to take a DNA test to determine his genealogy that will detail the percentage of his sub-Saharan African Black, European, white and Native American ancestry. Tuesday’s presentation will not be part of the PBS “Finding Your Roots” show, but can be seen on Trinity’s Facebook page and YouTube channel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

of regional Sistema orchestras around Venezuela. Guerrero, then in his 20s, was appointed to lead one of those orchestras, in the western state of Táchira — his first professional conducting job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I owe basically my career to El Sistema and Venezuela,” Guerrero, 56, told WBEZ in a recent phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-960000\" name=\"image-960000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f59eafc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+378/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5f%2F8d%2F00b690e7433484ca2eec11d0b26f%2Fconcierto-de-otono-featuring-venezuelan-trumpet-virtuoso-pacho-flores-photo-credit-grant-park-music-festival-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c4d300/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+378/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5f%2F8d%2F00b690e7433484ca2eec11d0b26f%2Fconcierto-de-otono-featuring-venezuelan-trumpet-virtuoso-pacho-flores-photo-credit-grant-park-music-festival-1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d2b9d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+378/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5f%2F8d%2F00b690e7433484ca2eec11d0b26f%2Fconcierto-de-otono-featuring-venezuelan-trumpet-virtuoso-pacho-flores-photo-credit-grant-park-music-festival-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Concierto de Otoño featuring Venezuelan trumpet virtuoso Pacho Flores\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d2b9d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+378/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5f%2F8d%2F00b690e7433484ca2eec11d0b26f%2Fconcierto-de-otono-featuring-venezuelan-trumpet-virtuoso-pacho-flores-photo-credit-grant-park-music-festival-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a1aa59/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+378/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5f%2F8d%2F00b690e7433484ca2eec11d0b26f%2Fconcierto-de-otono-featuring-venezuelan-trumpet-virtuoso-pacho-flores-photo-credit-grant-park-music-festival-1.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d2b9d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+378/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5f%2F8d%2F00b690e7433484ca2eec11d0b26f%2Fconcierto-de-otono-featuring-venezuelan-trumpet-virtuoso-pacho-flores-photo-credit-grant-park-music-festival-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Pacho Flores (left) became an international soloist, and Giancarlo Guerrero (right) famous enough to score a cameo appearance in Bad Bunny’s halftime show, both men passed through the same organization: El Sistema Nacional de Orquestas y Coros Juveniles e Infantiles de Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Grant Park Music Festival&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Sistema was founded in 1975 by economist&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;and conductor José Antonio Abreu, a former cultural minister who used his political clout to turn El Sistema into a state-run program. The country’s oil boom fueled El Sistema’s rapid growth, organized into so-called &lt;i&gt;núcleos &lt;/i&gt;— like the one Guerrero led, in Táchira —&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;across all 23&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;states in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its top orchestra, the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra, first became a global sensation after &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8wS-1Eqonk\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a high-octane performance at the 2007 BBC Proms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, donning windbreakers emblazoned with the Venezuelan flag. More recently, the orchestra opened for Coldplay during its 10 sold-out concerts at Wembley Stadium last summer, with frontman Chris Martin &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW29-Tgwcz4&amp;amp;list=RDGW29-Tgwcz4&amp;amp;start_radio=1\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;hailing it onstage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as “maybe the best orchestra in the whole world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, El Sistema alums are conspicuously well-represented in classical music institutions and conservatories everywhere. This fall, Venezuela-born conductor Gustavo Dudamel, 45, will take the reins of America’s most visible classical music post, the New York Philharmonic, while still acting as music director of the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra. Fellow conductor Rafael Payare, who participated in El Sistema at the same time as Dudamel, leads the San Diego and Montréal symphonies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Venezuelan musicians are members of some of the world’s best orchestras, from the Berlin Philharmonic to our own Chicago Symphony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People talk about oil, especially nowadays in Venezuela,”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Guerrero said. “Honestly, it is professional classical music which may be the biggest export for that country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-4d0000\" name=\"image-4d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7ef5e72/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bcc5b41/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6e19f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Giancarlo Guerrero, artistic director and principal conductor of Chicago&amp;#x27;s Grant Park Music Festival.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6e19f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c5ac3a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6e19f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I owe basically my career to El Sistema and Venezuela,” Giancarlo Guerrero, artistic director and principal conductor of Chicago’s Grant Park Music Festival, told WBEZ in a recent phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victor Hilitski for the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid a flashpoint in U.S.-Venezuela relations and ramped up domestic immigration enforcement, the future of that export has never been more in question.

Those exceptions were narrowed further &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/suspension-of-visa-issuance-to-foreign-nationals-to-protect-the-security-of-the-united-states.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;in January&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That spells uncertainty for Venezuelan musicians who might have otherwise moved to Chicago to pursue their career, whether at the city’s many top-tier conservatories or through early-career opportunities at the Chicago Symphony, Civic Orchestra of Chicago or Grant Park Music Festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have two [Venezuelan] students who want to come, who are really good, and I'd like them to come,”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;said Almita Vamos, a Chicago-based violin pedagogue whose prestigious studio attracts students from around the globe. “I don't know if they can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Play, sing and fight&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Sistema is a massive organization that defies easy definition. Its core operations pertain to its nationwide network of community music schools that offer extracurricular instruction to children free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it also encompasses several professional ensembles, all at the apex of their respective regional &lt;i&gt;núcleos.&lt;/i&gt; Accomplished students, no matter how young, can progress and join the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nicaraguan-born, Costa Rica–raised Guerrero says that kids as young as 12 and 13 years old played alongside veteran musicians in his professional orchestra in Táchira. Sometimes, members from various levels of the &lt;i&gt;núcleo&lt;/i&gt; play together for special events — a spectacle of orchestral performance that doubled as a learning experience for the younger musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’d be doing Beethoven symphonies with 400 players,” Guerrero recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in its earliest years, El Sistema’s focus on ensemble education — at first orchestral education, with choirs added later — set it apart from other free music programs. Founder José Antonio Abreu codified El Sistema’s mission as one of social uplift, drawing parallels between the collaborative nature of a musical ensemble and civic participation. More idealistically, El Sistema positions itself as a way for Venezuela to conquer growing poverty and gang violence — echoed in its mantra to “play, sing and fight” (“tocar, cantar y luchar”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The project was always seen as national development as opposed to cultural or artistic development,” says Norma Núñez-Ruch, operations manager of both the Loop venue &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/music/2024/10/17/guarneri-hall-performances-chicago-classical-music-venue\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Guarneri Hall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Segundo Ruiz Belvis Cultural Center in Hermosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Núñez-Ruch, 39, trained on the viola through El Sistema and held administrative jobs in the program for six years before working at some spinoff programs in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Simón Bolívar Orchestra, and by extension El Sistema, dazzled the world 20 years ago, copycat programs sprung up in under-resourced communities across the globe. Some of the most prominent examples in the United States include the Los Angeles Philharmonic’s Youth Orchestra Los Angeles (YOLA) and the Baltimore Symphony’s OrchKids program, a brainchild of Ravinia chief conductor Marin Alsop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locally, Ravinia’s Reach Teach Play programming also includes a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicagophilharmonic.org/national-seminario-ravinia-recap/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Sistema-inspired pillar for orchestral students&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as does &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://peoplesmusicschool.org/50years/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;the People’s Music School&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Uptown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-910000\" name=\"image-910000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff90fc4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5c%2F3f%2F2b8082114ac38a42ddec513f88e2%2Fraviniareno-080925-9.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2fb02e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5c%2F3f%2F2b8082114ac38a42ddec513f88e2%2Fraviniareno-080925-9.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24d53a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5c%2F3f%2F2b8082114ac38a42ddec513f88e2%2Fraviniareno-080925-9.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The Sandra K.

Musicians of any age can advance to its paid, professional-level orchestras, and, in many cases, children are paid enough to become the primary breadwinners for their family. That incentivizes students’ participation and progression in El Sistema, but also sometimes lends it a brutal competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have a very good friend who told me he was making more money at 20 than his father, who was an engineer,”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;says Ricardo Lorenz, a Venezuelan-born composer who now teaches at Michigan State University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenz and Núñez-Ruch both remember a time when those salaries were enough to keep musicians inside Venezuela. But when its economy collapsed in the 2010s&lt;b&gt;,&lt;/b&gt; even well-heeled El Sistema no longer had the funds to retain musicians. A surge in musicians choosing to study and work abroad followed — and Venezuela’s loss became the world’s gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where music and politics collide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Sistema and Abreu himself have been the subjects of widespread criticism both within and outside Venezuela for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program was founded more than 20 years before the presidency of Hugo Chávez, whose populist ideology laid the groundwork for the more tight-fisted authoritarianism of his successor, Nicolás Maduro. But the degree to which El Sistema has been used as a propaganda tool by both regimes has led to accusations of political opportunism and “artwashing” — in other words, using culture to distract from a bleaker political reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan pianist Gabriela Montero, who regularly performs with world-class orchestras like the Chicago Symphony, is one such critic. She told The Times of London last year that “it is no longer morally acceptable to host orchestras owned and operated by rogue states as mechanisms of soft power and influence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many have petitioned Dudamel to take a similarly firm stance. Though the conductor &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2017/05/04/526897569/gustavo-dudamel-addresses-venezuelas-leaders-enough-is-enough\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;has criticized the Maduro regime in the past&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — most notably in 2017, when an El Sistema student was killed by soldiers during a protest — he remains music director of the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra, El Sistema’s most prestigious ensemble, and a champion for the organization at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f80000\" name=\"image-f80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b789b29/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a0dd07/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e460fea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The Chicago Symphony Orchestra rehearses Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 1 in G minor, Winter Daydreams (or Winter Dreams) Op. 13 in the Loop, Wednesday, April 17, 2024\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e460fea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7c34cce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e460fea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venezuelan musicians are members of some of the world’s best orchestras, from the Berlin Philharmonic to our own Chicago Symphony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she worked for El Sistema during the Chávez years, Núñez-Ruch notes that many within the organization were clear-eyed about Venezuela’s political realities. At the same time, El Sistema receives some 80% of its funding from the Venezuelan government, leaving the organization essentially stuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my perception, [the attitude of El Sistema] was, ‘Say whatever you want to say as long as we can sustain the work.’ That's part of the political strategy of the organization and its leadership,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Venezuelan government’s dysfunction and strong-arming tendencies sometimes snowball into El Sistema itself. While living in Chicago in the early 2000s, Lorenz was helping spearhead a community program with the Chicago Symphony in Pilsen. Abreu pushed Lorenz to forge a connection between the CSO and El Sistema, which never materialized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Abreu, who was always “supportive” of Lorenz’s career, later reached out asking if Lorenz would be interested in returning to Venezuela. While Lorenz mulled the offer, Chávez named the composer to replace the current president of the Instituto Universitario De Estudios Musicales in Caracas via his weekly television program, “Aló Presidente.” Lorenz was shocked. He’d only been in early talks for the position, which he quickly declined. The episode effectively ended his relationship with Abreu. “He was very disappointed after that,” Lorenz recalls. (Abreu died in 2018.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, British scholar Geoffrey Baker has cast doubt on the idea that the program prioritizes social uplift at all. In the absence of demographic data, which El Sistema keeps private, his 2014 book “El Sistema: Orchestrating Venezuela's Youth”&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;leaned on hundreds of interviews and a year observing El Sistema’s &lt;i&gt;núcleos&lt;/i&gt;. Baker’s findings indicated that the program served a core demographic of middle-to-upper-class children, with impoverished students in the minority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Baker observed that El Sistema’s “revolutionary” educational philosophy was, if anything, retrograde. &lt;i&gt;Núcleos&lt;/i&gt; more often resembled old-school European conservatoires where endless hours of practice were the norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I naively thought that when Abreu died and more musicians left the country, some would start speaking out about the problems,” Baker wrote to WBEZ via e-mail. “But I hadn't counted on the fact that El Sistema's good name was essential to their job prospects overseas — it was their meal ticket.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-af0000\" name=\"image-af0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04d6664/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9d80562/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bad3ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Protesters gather in Water Tower Park downtown to denounce the arrest of Venezuela’s President Maduro and the ICE-involved killings of Renee Nicole Good and Silverio Villegas González as part of a national day of action, Saturday, Jan. 10, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bad3ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e0fe5f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bad3ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters gather in Water Tower Park in Downtown Chicago in January 2026 to denounce the arrest of Venezuela’s President Maduro.

But she does feel as though El Sistema was operating with more political deftness than it is often given credit for. She points to El Sistema’s use of broadly Venezuelan symbolism on its tours rather than the United Socialist Party’s logo, at a time when that imagery was ubiquitous inside Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Managing that is not a small feat,” Núñez-Ruch said of the organization’s ability to detach itself from Chávez-related iconography. “It’s something that is very herculean, and only in hindsight, and outside of the country, can I see how masterful it was not to cross that line.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenz likewise “owes a debt of gratitude” to El Sistema, he wrote via e-mail, despite his own mixed feelings. Next month, Dudamel will conduct a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.laphil.com/musicdb/pieces/7415/humboldts-nature\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;new work&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Lorenz’s to commemorate his final season with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which he has led since 2009. The piece is inspired by Venezuela’s landscape: the rugged eastern coast, birds twittering in the six-mile-long Guácharo Cave, and drumbeats ringing over Lake Tacarigua, to the north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sad part of all these things that have happened in the past month is that it’s trying to bring us back 100 years, where the only thing that Venezuela has is oil,” Lorenz says. “I thought we were beyond that.”&lt;/p&gt;",

They were looking for a few good Catholic girls — to work at the FBI. One of the students at the school that day, Patricia DePasquale, talked years later about these FBI recruiters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Working for the FBI, getting this job after high school, it gave her the independence and freedom that I think she wanted,” said DePasquale’s daughter Carmie Callobre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callobre, who lives in Skokie, said that back in the 1940s, her mother jumped at the opportunity to work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. For the next several years, DePasquale was a switchboard operator for the FBI’s Chicago office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d10000\" name=\"image-d10000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff32c2f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1912x1073+0+819/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2F02%2F466387df48c492f05a66c2bb0f11%2Funnamed-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a793549/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1912x1073+0+819/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2F02%2F466387df48c492f05a66c2bb0f11%2Funnamed-2.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72e7942/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1912x1073+0+819/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2F02%2F466387df48c492f05a66c2bb0f11%2Funnamed-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Patricia DePasquale\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72e7942/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1912x1073+0+819/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2F02%2F466387df48c492f05a66c2bb0f11%2Funnamed-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4dcdacf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1912x1073+0+819/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2F02%2F466387df48c492f05a66c2bb0f11%2Funnamed-2.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72e7942/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1912x1073+0+819/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2F02%2F466387df48c492f05a66c2bb0f11%2Funnamed-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patricia DePasquale was a student at Notre Dame High School for Girls when the FBI hired her to work as a switchboard operator in 1947.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Carmie Callobre&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She even dated some FBI agents. “Mom was gorgeous when she was young, and she dated a lot of people,” Callobre said. “And she definitely did date FBI agents. They would just take her anywhere downtown. She would go to, probably, the Berghoff. Definitely Italian Village.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePasquale eventually left the FBI and started working at a law firm. The man she eventually fell in love with and married — Callobre’s father, Edmund Daugird — was the manager of a bar in Rosemont. DePasquale, who died in 2024, later worked at restaurants, catering businesses and a corporate cafeteria. Years later, Callobre wondered how common it was for the FBI to recruit girls from Catholic schools in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was flabbergasted the first time … she told us about that,” Callobre said. “I thought, ‘Well, that’s odd.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In more recent decades, the FBI has become known for its competitive hiring process. But there is an extensive history of the agency recruiting high school girls to work office jobs in an earlier era. How much of that initiative focused on Chicago and Catholic schools? The FBI did not answer requests for information for this story, but historians and former high school recruits cast light on those hiring practices, which eventually set the stage for women to become FBI special agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt; ‘Catholic girls would fit in’ at the FBI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as Pat DePasquale’s life diverged from the FBI, she kept in touch with her former co-workers at the bureau, maintaining those ties by joining the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://thefbialumni.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Society of FBI Alumni&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It started as a group of ladies who went to lunch and just wanted to keep their FBI connection and their friendships together,” said Western Springs resident Jane McCarty, who was the Society of FBI Alumni’s president until November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Formally organized in 1973, the alumni group began inviting men to join in 1979, but most of the members are still women. “We have agents in our group, but predominantly we’re support staff — intelligence analysts, IT people, typists, the clerical staff,” McCarty said. The national organization has a chapter in Chicago with 120 members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a80000\" name=\"image-a80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/763f7b7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5599x3142+0+667/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2c%2F0f%2F135917634cb6892af148429a0c3d%2F1948studentsfrontdoors.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f9a67da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5599x3142+0+667/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2c%2F0f%2F135917634cb6892af148429a0c3d%2F1948studentsfrontdoors.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7ebd23e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5599x3142+0+667/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2c%2F0f%2F135917634cb6892af148429a0c3d%2F1948studentsfrontdoors.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"1948StudentsFrontDoors.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7ebd23e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5599x3142+0+667/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2c%2F0f%2F135917634cb6892af148429a0c3d%2F1948studentsfrontdoors.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4cfc751/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5599x3142+0+667/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2c%2F0f%2F135917634cb6892af148429a0c3d%2F1948studentsfrontdoors.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7ebd23e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5599x3142+0+667/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2c%2F0f%2F135917634cb6892af148429a0c3d%2F1948studentsfrontdoors.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students stand at the door of Notre Dame High School for Girls in Chicago, Illinois in 1948.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;SNDdeN Virtual Archives&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCarty said the FBI regularly sent recruiters to high schools all over the country, and not just Catholic schools. Even now, the FBI has &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/outreach\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Teen Academy and Youth Academy programs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which “allow high school and middle school students an opportunity to get a comprehensive look into today’s FBI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When McCarty was a student at a public high school in California in 1968, FBI recruiters showed up there. A month after McCarty graduated, she started working for the FBI as a stenographer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today, I probably could not get my job, because you need a college degree,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This recruiting tactic was not targeted at Catholic school girls exclusively. But when McCarty transferred to the FBI’s Chicago office in 1979, she did notice a number of the local employees were from Notre Dame High School for Girls. (Located at 3000 N. Mango Ave. in the Belmont Central neighborhood, the school closed in 2016.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those Catholic girls would fit in because, you know, you had to have a certain-length skirt,” McCarty said. “The rules were the rules. I mean, we couldn’t wear pants until ’72. There were so many rules like that, it would be like a Catholic school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones, author of the 2007 book &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300142846/the-fbi/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;The FBI: A History&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, said a strategy of hiring Catholic girls would line up perfectly with longtime FBI Director J.

He went out of his way to praise the Catholic schools in America. He explicitly said that these schools have amongst their teaching staff not a single example of an atheist. And of course, communism, amongst other things, stands for atheism. That was his outlook.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoover did send FBI agents to recruit young women from Catholic schools on the East Coast; Jeffreys-Jones said he’d be surprised if Hoover didn’t do the same thing in Chicago, a city still heavily influenced by its Catholic culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During World War II, the FBI had vastly expanded the number of women on its payroll. In addition to working as secretaries, stenographers and switchboard operators, women began to take on more skilled activities, such as statistical analysis and code-breaking. “However, they still weren’t permitted to become the elite special agents,” Jeffreys-Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoover’s sexism was a major obstacle to that sort of reform, although as Jeffreys-Jones noted, women faced similar prejudice throughout the world of law enforcement. “I think it is frustrating for women to serve only in the lower ranks of an agency like the FBI, and we do have proof definitive that women can make very good detectives,” he said. (As evidence, Jeffreys-Jones pointed to 19th-century Chicago sleuth Kate Warne, whom he wrote about in his 2025 book&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://press.georgetown.edu/Book/Allan-Pinkerton\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Allan Pinkerton: America’s Legendary Detective and the Birth of Private Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moving up the ranks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1971, 16-year-old Nancy McRae wrote a letter to Hoover saying she hoped to become a special agent. Hoover wrote back: “Because of the nature of the duties our Special Agents are called upon to perform, we do not employ women in that position. We must have Agents who are qualified to cope with any situation they may face.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoover died in 1972, ending his 48-year reign as the director of the FBI and its precursor agency, the Bureau of Investigation. Just two months after his death, the FBI finally allowed women to become special agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I know, what all of you know, and what Hoover either did not know or did not acknowledge, is that women are absolutely essential to effective law enforcement,” then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches-and-testimony/director-wrays-remarks-at-the-women-in-federal-law-enforcement-annual-leadership-training\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;2024 speech&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the group Women in Federal Law Enforcement. At the time he spoke, 24% of FBI special agents — and 37% of agent trainees — were women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a20000\" name=\"image-a20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/21c03f8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F65%2F8e06fa3c4f2d90b3230262ff6383%2Ffbi-111319.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a7ef6b5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F65%2F8e06fa3c4f2d90b3230262ff6383%2Ffbi-111319.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/daefcd8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F65%2F8e06fa3c4f2d90b3230262ff6383%2Ffbi-111319.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"FBI-111319\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/daefcd8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F65%2F8e06fa3c4f2d90b3230262ff6383%2Ffbi-111319.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d13c39c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F65%2F8e06fa3c4f2d90b3230262ff6383%2Ffbi-111319.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/daefcd8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F65%2F8e06fa3c4f2d90b3230262ff6383%2Ffbi-111319.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Seal of the FBI at the Chicago office of the FBI in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Foster/Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wray resigned in January 2025 as Donald Trump returned to the presidency, setting the stage for Trump to appoint Kash Patel as FBI director.

George Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Jane McCarty began working for the FBI during Hoover’s reign, she said she didn’t experience much discrimination. She eventually worked her way up through the ranks to become an asset forfeiture investigator. “Somebody took a chance on me,” she said. “Somebody said, ‘I think she could do the job.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callobre said her mom spoke nostalgically of her time as an FBI employee — and McCarty said that attitude is common among the Society of FBI Alumni’s members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We still have the FBI in our heart,” McCarty said. “We all have very fond memories of our work there, and are very proud.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Robert Loerzel is a journalist based in Chicago.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-bf0000\" name=\"module-bf0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;More about our question-asker&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-8b0000\" name=\"image-8b0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1f5e737/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1740x977+0+672/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F47%2Feea3ebc64445a8f266ec5c0cd224%2F1000001138.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/be3263e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1740x977+0+672/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F47%2Feea3ebc64445a8f266ec5c0cd224%2F1000001138.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2b06ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1740x977+0+672/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F47%2Feea3ebc64445a8f266ec5c0cd224%2F1000001138.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Carmie Callobre\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2b06ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1740x977+0+672/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F47%2Feea3ebc64445a8f266ec5c0cd224%2F1000001138.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3d6b55f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1740x977+0+672/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F47%2Feea3ebc64445a8f266ec5c0cd224%2F1000001138.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2b06ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1740x977+0+672/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F47%2Feea3ebc64445a8f266ec5c0cd224%2F1000001138.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Carmie Callobre&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;After growing up on Chicago’s Northwest Side and in Niles, Carmie Callobre studied theology at Loyola University. Now a longtime Skokie resident, she worked as an administrative assistant at various businesses before retiring in 2013.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the next dozen years, she often visited her mother, whose married name at the end of her life was Pat Daugird-Ehlen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“She had short-term memory loss, but she was doing OK,” Carmie said, noting that her mom was known for her sense of humor. She recalled a doctor visiting her mom in early 2024: “He said, ‘Do you know what day it is?’ And she said, ‘It’s my birthday.’ He said, ‘Do you know how old you are?’ And she said, ‘I was born in 1929. You do the math.’”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although Carmie had countless conversations with her mom, she said her mom never did tell her very much about what it was like working for the FBI. That was one topic about which she was “very tight-lipped.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-750000\" name=\"html-embed-module-750000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=\"https://modules.wearehearken.com/wbez/embed/4190.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Jesse Jackson appears with a large group of young children, representing virtually every color and ethnic group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his Afro in full bloom, Jackson takes his youthful rainbow coalition through a call-and-response recitation of the Rev. William Borders poem that Jackson made internationally known: \"I Am Somebody.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zuZV7ES4VE8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Jesse Jackson &amp;#39;I Am Somebody&amp;#39; on Sesame Street\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;PBS, which broadcast \"Sesame Street,\" was still in its infancy. The landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 was as recent then as, say, the COVID-19 crisis is now. And 30-year-old Jackson was at the start of a quarter-century run as a cultural presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson's decades civil rights efforts and running for president in 1984 and 1988 are his most important and lasting work. But that he did this while also forging a position in the nation's pop cultural firmament is nonetheless remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could be inspirational, as he was on \"Sesame Street\" and during a 1989 appearance on the sitcom &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://youtu.be/KUDQhdKxjH8?si=xCHW2WvVfPZTz8b0\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“A Different World,”&lt;/a&gt; talking about the role of young people in elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jackson could also be quite funny, as evidenced by the straight-faced delivery of Dr. Suess' \"Green Eggs and Ham\" on Saturday Night Live in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He understood media,\" Charles Whitaker, dean of Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. said. \"He understood the relevance of being able to engage with audiences. The combination of politician and preacher just made him a magnetic force.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A1mqg4C0awA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Green Eggs and Ham narrated by the Reverend Jesse Jackson\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Behind the camera&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Linking Black entertainers to the civil/political/economics rights movement was also important to Jackson. He was a producer of Wattstax, the 1972 benefit concert by Stax Records to mark the seventh anniversary of the Watts riots in Los Angeles. The event became a double album and a concert film in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isaac Hayes, the Staple Singers, the Emotions, the Bar-Kays and comedian Richard Pryor were among the performers who got-down at Wattstax. But so did Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is a beautiful day,\" Jackson told the LA Memorial Coliseum audience in his opening speech. \"It is a new day. It is a day of Black awareness. It is a day of Black people taking care of Black people’s business. We are together, we are unified and all in accord. Because when we are together we got power. And we can make decisions.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in 1972 at the International Amphitheatre at 42nd and Halsted streets, Jackson pulled off a similar effort: Save the Children, a benefit concert for his Operation PUSH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line up included Marvin Gaye, the Jackson Five, the Temptations, Roberta Flack, Curtis Mayfield, Bill Withers and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-4b0000\" name=\"image-4b0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0367f7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+2/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F3f%2Ff0a1bd474f98a2f0ac825b340ab0%2Fjackson5-1-1-47.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7b35a2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+2/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F3f%2Ff0a1bd474f98a2f0ac825b340ab0%2Fjackson5-1-1-47.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/353d38e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+2/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F3f%2Ff0a1bd474f98a2f0ac825b340ab0%2Fjackson5-1-1-47.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The Jackson 5 perform during the 1972 Black Expo in Chicago.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/353d38e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+2/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F3f%2Ff0a1bd474f98a2f0ac825b340ab0%2Fjackson5-1-1-47.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/27020ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+2/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F3f%2Ff0a1bd474f98a2f0ac825b340ab0%2Fjackson5-1-1-47.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/353d38e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+2/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F3f%2Ff0a1bd474f98a2f0ac825b340ab0%2Fjackson5-1-1-47.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jackson 5 perform during the 1972 Black Expo in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Save the Children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The homegrown Chi-Lites performed, too.

He had been friends with Jackson since the 1960s. \"I mean, it was like magic.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson said Jackson encouraged the group to write their 1971 message song, \"(For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People.\" The lyrics almost read like an excerpt of Jackson's speeches:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't have enough to eat&lt;br&gt;How can you think of love?&lt;br&gt;You don't have the time to care&lt;br&gt;So it's crime you're guilty of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Save the Children benefit was turned into a concert film that had a short theatrical run then went unseen for 50 years. Directed by Stan Lathan — a director of \"Sesame Street\" episodes during Jackson's 1971 appearance — the film was digitally restored and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2024/10/18/save-the-children-chicago-jesse-jackson-stan-lathan-1972-black-expo-sammy-davis-jr\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;put back in circulation&lt;/a&gt; in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who’s got next?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his time in the cultural spotlight, Jackson was also parodied by Eddie Murphy on SNL and Keenan Ivory Wayans on the '90s FOX sketch show \"In Living Color.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He hosted SNL in 1984. He made political points in his opening monologue — and snuck some wisecracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I took [Fidel] Castro to church for the first time in 30 years,\" he said. \"If I coulda stayed [in Cuba] longer, I coulda actually got him a shave.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Being able to make fun of himself, I think made him more human,\" Jazz Institute of Chicago Executive Director Heather Ireland Robinson, who knows the Jackson family, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1990, Kris Kristofferson wrote a song called \"Jesse Jackson\" and sang it with Willie Nelson. The pair sang: \"Hold on brother, Jesse Jackson. There's a better world a'coming. Where a man can hope a man will show some heart. You just keep right on believing. In the better side of human. They ain't ready for it yet, but it's a start. And you move'em when you hit'em in the heart.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's cultural and media landscape is as fragmented as it is ever-present. Can a civil rights leader today have the same impact as did Jackson? Likely not, Whitaker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We don't see anyone breaking through quite like in the way that Jesse Jackson did,\" he said. \"Even a Barack Obama, who's a phenomenon and a wonder in his own right, has not used that platform in the same way as Jesse Jackson.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/obituaries/2026/02/17/rev-jesse-jackson-civil-rights-leader-rainbow-push-obituary\"   &gt;Rev.

They allow a food-minded public to restaurant-shop — and for&amp;nbsp;restaurateurs, they're a lower-risk entry point to test if a concept has legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pandemic impact&lt;/b&gt;: Many in the food industry point to COVID-19. When Time Out Market in Fulton Market closed last month, owners cited the pandemic's impact on office occupancy due to more people working from home. Time Out's vendors reportedly also noted its lack of investment in drawing customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benefits remain&lt;/b&gt;: Downtown foot traffic and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrlkly-l-d/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;office tenancy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are reportedly creeping back up, and workers want compelling, wallet-friendly lunch options. Such spaces also remain incubators for promising concepts. And they are getting more savvy about marketing themselves to tourists, who appreciate local options close to the sights without the hassle of booking tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Still serving&lt;/b&gt;: If you're looking to indulge in the concept, among the city's food halls still going strong are Sterling Food Hall, 125 S Clark St.; From Here On Food Hall in Market, 433 W Van Buren St.; and 88 Marketplace,&amp;nbsp;2105 S.

Jesse Jackson, 84. Flowers, a white balloon and a note to the Jackson family rested Tuesday morning on the pavement near the headquarters of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the nonprofit Jackson formed in 1970 that has spent decades working toward racial equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;His legacy&lt;/b&gt;: The Sun-Times and WBEZ spoke with community members, former colleagues, supporters, activists and Jackson's neighbors, who all reflected on their memories of the civil rights leader and the&amp;nbsp;impact he made. Regarded as Martin Luther King Jr.'s protege, Jackson worked throughout the Civil Rights movement and after to champion rights for Black people. In the 1980s, Jackson ran the first viable presidential campaign by a Black candidate in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key quote&lt;/b&gt;: \"He was courageous, and he had enough heart to challenge wrong,\" Gregory Sain, a community supporter, said of Jackson’s impact. \"We have to continue to motivate, inspire and raise up other individuals. Rev. Jackson will be a hero to many people.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More on Rev.

embankment — and more arrive yearly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Reporting by &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrlkly-l-ti/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Genevieve Bookwalter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorful images of turtles, monsters, parrots, people and more cover the walls supporting the Green Line as it goes through the heart of Oak Park. About 230 are on both sides of the embankment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2010, the Oak Park Area Arts Council has worked with village officials to commission 20 to 30 murals a year to be painted in the frames of concrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are found on aptly named North Boulevard and South Boulevard — on the north and south sides of the L tracks — from downtown Oak Park to the CTA Green Line Austin station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There’s still a lot more to do,\" says Camille Wilson White, executive director of the Oak Park Area Arts Council. \"We are proud of these murals. People love them.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson White said the collection contains murals by dozens of artists who come from Oak Park, the greater Chicago area and across the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communities around the country want to learn how they can start their own mural walls,&amp;nbsp;Wilson White said. \"It’s a cool thing about being in Oak Park. It’s the art of uncommon community.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrlkly-l-td/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;YOUR DAILY QUESTION ☕️&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, we asked you:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrlkly-l-tk/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;What is your defining memory of Rev. Jesse Jackson?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s some of what you said…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"As a Northwestern University undergraduate, I marched with Jesse Jackson in the streets of Chicago for civil rights. In 1968, we were tear-gassed by Richard J. Daley's cops — illegally. I also marched with him in anti-Vietnam War marches.\" —&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Harvey J. Graff&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"My husband and his friends frequented the Division Street Baths in the '70s thru the '90s. It was always a special occasion when 'The Reverend' and his entourage came into the steam room. Mr Jackson, like any good politician, would shake hands and introduce himself to everyone sitting on the tiled tiers. His charisma was contagious.\" —&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Sandy Doyle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"My special memory of Jesse Jackson happened Super Tuesday — Feb. 5, 2008. I was an Obama volunteer attending the party and broadcast of Barack Obama's speech at the Hyatt. Jesse Jackson was in the bleachers behind me doing live shots with reporters. After the cameras were locked on Barack, I noticed Jesse alone and holding an Obama sign. His mind and heart were elsewhere — perhaps pondering what 'could have been' for himself or one of his children. It was the tenderest moment of a politician, activist, human that I've seen up close and personal.\" —&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Doreen Rice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I had the honor to know and do some work with him, appearing on his radio show, receiving the Martin Luther King Jr. and Lyndon Johnson award from him, and assisting his organizations where I could. I have spent most of my life defending people facing the death penalty, work which Rev. Jackson supported. My memory is not just [his] amazing work ... It's of him sitting quietly with me at a table at the Illinois Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers dinner honoring his son, former Congressman Jackson. It's of him taking the time to speak with my then-teenage son, of his kind inquiries regarding my late husband's health, and his concern for humanity in general.\" —&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Andrea Lyon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have your own memories of Rev. Jackson?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrlkly-l-tu/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Share them here&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading the Sun-Times&amp;nbsp;Morning Edition!&lt;br&gt;Got a story you think we missed?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:newsletters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Email us here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written and curated by&lt;/b&gt;: Matt Moore&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor&lt;/b&gt;: Eydie Cubarrubia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Chicago Sun-Times is a nonprofit supported by&amp;nbsp;readers like you.
