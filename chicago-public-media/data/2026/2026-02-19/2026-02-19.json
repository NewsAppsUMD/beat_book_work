After prayer, worshippers went downstairs where long tables were set for a communal meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They came together with a renewed focus on safety, turning to one another for support amid heightened immigration enforcement across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"A lot of us are children of immigrants, or [are] immigrants,\" said Rana Jaber, a board member at the center. \"We let our community know that this is a safe space for them.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help ensure that safety, Jaber said the Downtown Islamic Center increased their security measures and education in recent months to ensure people can gather to pray safely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramadan, which began on Tuesday evening in the United States, is observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting from sunrise to sunset, prayer and spiritual reflection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The whole exercise [of Ramadan] is like a boot camp of turning back to God, re-centering yourself, remembering your purpose, your mission,\" said Abrar Omeish, 31. \"It's turning back to remember who's in control.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as worshippers at the center focused on spiritual renewal, Omeish said many are also navigating uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located near DePaul University's downtown Loop campus, the center draws international students from local universities, families and newcomers to Chicago looking for community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omeish said that renewed immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump has impacted members of the community, as many come from immigrant backgrounds. Still, she said, Ramadan offers a reminder to remain grounded and steadfast in their faith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's about finding the goodness in whatever is to come — whether ...  you live the rest of your life here, or maybe are forced out of this country,\" she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, \"We come together as a community to remind ourselves of that, and to remind ourselves to stay grounded in what ultimately matters.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

I’m continuing to build up for the first game. … I'm feeling strong right now, but I need to continue working on that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcántara is competing for the fourth outfielder spot this spring, with Justin Dean and non-roster invitees Dylan Carlson and Chas McCormick also vying to make the Opening Day roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm here for the team,” Alcántara said he told manager Craig Counsell. “Whatever opportunity you bring me, I want to … do my best. I feel so happy with that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcántara was on the cusp of making the Tokyo Series roster last year,&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/03/11/cubs-set-tokyo-series-travel-roster-matt-shaw-expected-to-debut-in-japan\"   &gt; left off in favor of third baseman Matt Shaw&lt;/a&gt;. This year, Alcántara has the advantage of being pain-free, and having last year to point to as proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kevin did a heck of a job last September,” Counsell said this week. “There was not a lot of playing time, it was super sporadic. I thought his preparation was great. In the clubhouse, he was great. When he got chances, executed what we wanted him to do. And I thought that was really important. And he had success. It was a successful month.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcántara didn’t get many chances. In his 10 appearances, he only had 11 at-bats. But he recorded four hits, an RBI and a stolen base. Then when it was time for the Cubs to select their playoff roster, they included him for both rounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That tells you what happened that last month,” Counsell said. “And now it's just, you’ve got to continue to get better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The issue is, when you put a good team together, it gets harder to make that team. It gets harder to find at-bats, find plate appearances. He's young. When the runway for opportunity comes, that's not quite clear yet. But I also think Kevin showed that he could, in a part time role, be a contributor. And certainly take note of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year in Triple-A, Alcántara had a streaky season. He finished with just a .266 batting average, while hitting a career-high 17 home runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did so while playing through pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's a nagging injury that you can play with but just is uncomfortable,” Counsell said. “... It doesn't take you off the field, but from a running perspective, explosiveness perspective, from a ‘how many swings do I have in me today’ preparation perspective, all those things, that's very real.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcántara is looking forward to showing what he can do without those limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope I’m healthy every year,” he said, “and continue to play a lot of games and help the team.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The Cubs announced their minor-league coaching staff Wednesday. Changes include new managers for High-A South Bend and the Arizona Complex League. In South Bend, Daniel Wasinger was promoted from bench coach. And former major-league infielder Dixon Machado, who also spent stints in the Cubs’ farm system, will be at the helm in the ACL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Counsell announced Wednesday that right-hander Jameson Taillon is set to start the Cubs’ Cactus League opener Friday against the White Sox at Sloan Park. Left-hander Matthew Boyd is penciled in for Saturday’s home game against the Rangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, title=Latest on the Cubs, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, count=13708, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, pageCount=4570, carouselSpeed=null, buttonHoverBgColor=#a91d23, rteHeadingFont=font-1, secondaryColor=#656565, hideCategories=true, _template=/page/list/includes/PageList-header.hbs, font3=Arial, font4=Source-serif-4, ctaUrl=null, hideImage=false, footerLinkHoverColor=#d3242c, _styledTemplate=/page/list/PageListE.hbs, hideAudioPlayback=false, description=[], listColumns234=null, showSecondItemMedia=false, footerTextColor=#ffffff, hideDescriptions=true, headerSecondaryBgColor=#000000, primaryTextColorInverse=#ffffff, titleColor=null, ampLink=null, listHeaderPosition=null, showActionBar=true, linkHoverColor=#d3242c, buttonBgColor=#d3242c, ctaTarget=null, suppressPagination=false, promoButtonText=null, backgroundColor=null, headerSecondaryTextColor=#ffffff, anchorId=list-c90005, listTitleFont=font-2, headlineFont=font-1, promoDescriptionFont=font-3, primaryColor=#d3242c, pullQuoteIcon=[{image=null, narrowImage=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=null}], slimFooter=false, hideHeadline=false, hideDates=true, headerBorderColor=#e9e9e9, pagination=[{body=[Next Page], href=?p=2, _template=/link/Link.hbs, contentId=null, pianoSectionSlug=null, target=null}], items=[{type=Image, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, media=[{image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/c3/5a/7e37377944c580e190c2e8ea401e/union-shakeup-baseball.jpg, width=5760, height=3840}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/c3/5a/7e37377944c580e190c2e8ea401e/union-shakeup-baseball.jpg, width=5760, height=3840}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=Bruce Meyer}], title=MLB Players Association bracing for lockout before 2027 season: &amp;#x27;All but guaranteed&amp;#x27;, category=[{items=[Cubs]}], _styledTemplate=null, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/maddie-lee, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[], media=[], jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Cubs reporter]}], name=[{items=[Maddie Lee]}]}], imageAlignment=null, isFeatured=false, wordCount=653, publishDate=February 18, 2026 07:23 PM, description=[{items=[MLBPA leadership visited Cubs camp on Wednesday.]}], target=null, primaryMediaType=null, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/18/mlb-players-association-bracing-for-lockout-before-2027-season-all-but-guaranteed-bruce-meyer-executive-director, ampLink=null, anchorId=promo-790000, audio=[], audioDuration=null, timestamp=1771464180000, _template=/page/promo/PagePromo.hbs}, {type=Image, title=MLBPA names Bruce Meyer interim executive director, description=[{items=[The decisions by the Major League Baseball Players Association executive board during an online meeting was a move for continuity ahead of the likely start in April of what figures to be contentious collective bargaining.]}], publishDate=February 18, 2026 07:10 PM, wordCount=257, _styledTemplate=null, media=[{narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/fc/34/bb0b180b48c99d36df69c9d02760/ap21336638856377.jpg, width=5670, height=3780}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/fc/34/bb0b180b48c99d36df69c9d02760/ap21336638856377.jpg, width=5670, height=3780}, alt=Bruce Meyer}], imageAlignment=null, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb, isFeatured=false, timestamp=1771463423000, target=null, primaryMediaType=null, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/associated-press, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, bio=[{items=[The Associated Press is an independent, not-for-profit news cooperative headquartered in New York City.

The four migrants appeared to be recently detained, clergy members said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You saw the crying eyes, confusion, uncertainty,” said Father Leandro Fossá, pastor for Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Melrose Park. “You could also see they were responsive, so they felt the hope of the moment they could see the church was there with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What clergy members found inside the facility was a far cry from what it would have been last year during the Trump administration's immigration blitz. The windows were still boarded up and a fence and other barriers still kept protesters and the public at bay, but the building was empty when they arrived, they said. Just four detainees arrived while they were there, a striking difference from reports last fall of the building being crowded with people and little room to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religious immigrant advocates, including the late Sisters Pat Murphy and JoAnn Persch, used to regularly visit with immigrants detained at the Broadview facility until the COVID-19 pandemic pushed visits online in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after faith leaders were &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/01/religious-leaders-request-to-give-communion-to-detainees-at-broadview-facility-is-denied-again\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;denied access&lt;/a&gt; this fall as the Trump administration upped its immigration enforcement in the area, some clergy members &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/19/clergy-sue-ice-over-restriction-on-providing-religious-services-to-detainees-intimidation-of-religious\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;sued the federal government&lt;/a&gt;. The Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership, a plaintiff in the case, accused the government of violating federal law and First Amendment rights of religious leaders and detainees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to continue to do what we were able to do for so many years and suddenly stopped with the change in direction here,” said Sister Jeremy Midura, a Felician sister and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. “Sister Pat and Sister JoAnn were able to go into the facility. All that changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clergy members said the facility appeared clean, despite reports of squalid conditions inside the building last fall, and immigration agents were accommodating. They said they intend to schedule more visits to the facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cupich praises injunction that allowed clergy into ICE facility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardinal Blase Cupich, Archbishop of Chicago, praised the federal judge's injunction that allowed clergy into the ICE facility.

Homegoing services are scheduled for 10 a.m. Saturday, Feb. 28, at Rainbow PUSH. Doors open at 9 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relatives of Jackson said that \"all are welcome,\" regardless of political party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Do not bring your politics, out of respect to Rev. Jesse Jackson and the life that he lived, to these homegoing services. They come respectful and come to say thank you,\" Jesse Jackson Jr. said during a media event in front of the Jackson family home. \"But these homegoing services are welcome to all — Democrat, Republican, liberal and conservative, right wing, left wing, because his life is broad enough to cover the full spectrum of what it means to be an American.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarded as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s protege, Jackson worked tirelessly throughout the Civil Rights Movement and after to champion for the rights of Black people. He started the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the famed Chicago-based multiracial nonprofit, in 1970, and it continues to fight for social change, economic equality and civil rights. In the 1980s, Jackson ran the first viable presidential campaign by a Black candidate in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of his death, leaders around the world and Chicago residents have shared messages of support for the family, remembering Jackson for his years of activism while mourning his loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How did he die?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the family has not given an official cause of death or said where he died, Jackson had been declining in health for a decade before his death. In 2015,&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2017/11/17/18375473/rev-jesse-jackson-announces-parkinson-s-diagnosis\"   &gt; Jackson was initially diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, but he revealed last April that it was actually progressive supranuclear palsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How is the political world reacting to his death?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political figures from across the country have weighed in to pay their respects and honor his legacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement, former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama wrote: \"Michelle and I will always be grateful for Jesse's lifetime of service, and the friendship our families share. We stood on his shoulders. We send our deepest condolences to the Jackson family and everyone in Chicago and beyond who knew and loved him.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump also extended his sympathies to Jackson's family in a statement posted to Truth Social Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I knew him well, long before becoming President,\" he said. \"He was very gregarious — Someone who truly loved people! Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago leaders, including Mayor Brandon Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker, also shared their condolences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"In honor of Rev. Jackson's service, and as our city mourns, the Chicago flag will lower to half-staff,\" Mayor Johnson wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker also ordered all flags across the state to fly at half-mast to honor him in a statement posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He broke down barriers, inspired generations, and kept hope alive. Our state, nation, and world are better due to his years of service,\" Pritzker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How are Chicago residents reacting to his death?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the city, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2026/02/17/jesse-jackson-chicago-remembers\"   &gt;Chicago residents mourned Jackson’s death&lt;/a&gt; and urged that his legacy continue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Travis, a congregant of Apostolic Church of God in Woodlawn, said in his youth, his parents brought him to demonstrations organized by Operation Breadbasket, a group Jackson led. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, 64, Travis remembers Jackson as \"instrumental in fighting for justice and freedom for all people.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chloe Gould, 41, a Bronzeville resident, said that his death still hit \"like you lost a family member.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of his death, she said she worries about the future of civil rights activism, as activists and leaders have not stepped in to fill his shoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Who is gonna be the civil rights activist now?\" she asked. &lt;/p&gt;",

Dr. Martin Luther King than Rev. Jesse Lewis Jackson,” said Santita Jackson, Jesse Jackson’s eldest daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Jackson died peacefully early Tuesday morning surrounded by his family, who said they will honor his life by carrying forward his commitment to justice and equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reverend had been in declining health for more than a decade. In 2017, he announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease two years earlier, but last April he revealed the diagnosis was actually progressive supranuclear palsy, a condition that also affects bodily movement. He was also hospitalized just months before he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in his final moments, Jackson’s children said their father never spoke about his pain and continued to “bounce back,” driven by his lifelong devotion to helping others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yusef Jackson said what kept his father going “was not his desire for more life, but his desire for more service.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His family said they reassured Jesse Jackson before he died that they would “continue his work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each of my siblings and my mother, we wanted to give him comfort that it was going to be all right, that he has taught us enough to continue his work,” said Yusef Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yusef Jackson said he would be taking the reins of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the famed Chicago-based multiracial nonprofit Jesse Jackson started in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Jackson never held public office, but in the 1980s, he ran the first viable presidential campaign by a Black candidate. His son, U.S. Rep. Jonathan Jackson, said he would use his congressional seat to continue to fight for equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That's our calling, that's our mission, and that's what we're going to fight for,” said Jonathan Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funeral services for Jesse Jackson are expected to begin next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reverend’s eldest son, Jesse Jackson Jr., said the services will welcome all, regardless of political party, but urged attendees to “not bring your politics out of respect” to his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His life is broad enough to cover the full spectrum of what it means to be an American,” said Jesse Jackson Jr. “We only ask people to come and be respectful.”&lt;/p&gt;",

Their strategy in bargaining has always been to put as much pressure on the players as they can to try and create divisions and cracks among our membership. It's never worked. I don't think it ever will work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meyer, previously the deputy executive director, was at Cubs camp to meet with the players as part of the union’s annual spring training circuit.&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/17/cubs-react-to-tony-clark-resigning-as-mlbpa-executive-director-the-strength-of-the-union-is-in-the-players\"   &gt; Tony Clark’s resignation as executive director Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; pushed back the players association’s camp meeting schedule, but it picked back up Wednesday with the Royals and Cubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb/2026/02/18/mlbpa-names-bruce-meyer-interim-executive-director\"   &gt;MLBPA names Bruce Meyer interim executive director&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Our staff, we've worked for years with Tony,” Meyer said. “We all have feelings for him as a human being. It's been very hard for a lot of us, for a lot of reasons. We haven't gotten much sleep, and in my case, haven't eaten much either. We've been on the phone, as you can imagine, informing players, agents reaching out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it's fine. The union is strong, will remain strong. This is not going to affect collective bargaining in any way, really. And we’ve just got to make sure we put the players in the best position to understand what's going on, make whatever informed decisions they're going to make. And whatever that takes, we're committed to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLBPA leadership addressed Clark’s resignation in the meeting with Cubs players but also forged ahead, discussing expected bargaining topics, according to sources. Meyer declined to comment on specifics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ll say, they were both very good meetings,” Meyer said. “A lot of great questions and participation from the players. So, terrific meetings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meyer, who is expected to retain his role as the union's lead negotiator, is not the first person to suggest that a lockout could be coming. It was a tool the owners used last bargaining cycle. And the league has already floated the idea of a salary cap, which the players have long opposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are preparing for a concerted push on the other side for a salary cap,” Meyer said. “And we're ready for it, and our players are ready for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, for his part, has downplayed the likelihood of a lockout that would impact the 2027 season. When asked in August what the contingency plan would be for the 2027 All-Star Game at Wrigley Field in the case of a work stoppage, he said: “My contingency plan is to make an agreement with the players and play the ‘27 season. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/16/cubs-chairman-tom-ricketts-on-potential-mlb-broadcast-consolidation-we-love-our-independence\"   &gt;Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts&lt;/a&gt; this spring declined to weigh in on specific bargaining topics, saying he’d leave those decisions up to the league. But he said his advice to fans following the posturing on both sides would be: “Enjoy the season. Enjoy the games as we have them. Obviously it's the last year of the collective bargaining agreement. Both the league and the players association want to make some improvements from their perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time the owners and players sat down at a bargaining table to hammer out a CBA, the sport went through a 99-day lockout before the sides ratified an agreement. It came just in time to salvage the full season, with opening day pushed back about a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are ready, willing and able to negotiate whenever and wherever they are ready to do that,” Meyer said Wednesday. “And if we can get an early deal and avoid the negative effects of a lockout — which is their decision — coming off a great season of baseball, great playoffs — if we can get a fair deal that avoids that, we will make every effort to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, title=Latest on the Cubs, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, pullQuoteIcon=[{image=null, narrowImage=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=null}], relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, items=[{type=Image, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, title=MLB Players Association bracing for lockout before 2027 season: &amp;#x27;All but guaranteed&amp;#x27;, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, category=[{items=[Cubs]}], isFeatured=false, media=[{image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/c3/5a/7e37377944c580e190c2e8ea401e/union-shakeup-baseball.jpg, width=5760, height=3840}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/c3/5a/7e37377944c580e190c2e8ea401e/union-shakeup-baseball.jpg, width=5760, height=3840}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=Bruce Meyer}], wordCount=653, publishDate=February 18, 2026 07:23 PM, description=[{items=[MLBPA leadership visited Cubs camp on Wednesday.]}], target=null, primaryMediaType=null, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/18/mlb-players-association-bracing-for-lockout-before-2027-season-all-but-guaranteed-bruce-meyer-executive-director, ampLink=null, anchorId=promo-790000, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/maddie-lee, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[], media=[], name=[{items=[Maddie Lee]}], jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Cubs reporter]}]}], audio=[], audioDuration=null, timestamp=1771464180000, _template=/page/promo/PagePromo.hbs}, {media=[{narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/fc/34/bb0b180b48c99d36df69c9d02760/ap21336638856377.jpg, width=5670, height=3780}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/fc/34/bb0b180b48c99d36df69c9d02760/ap21336638856377.jpg, width=5670, height=3780}, alt=Bruce Meyer}], type=Image, title=MLBPA names Bruce Meyer interim executive director, publishDate=February 18, 2026 07:10 PM, category=[{items=[MLB]}], wordCount=257, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb, isFeatured=false, timestamp=1771463423000, target=null, primaryMediaType=null, description=[{items=[The decisions by the Major League Baseball Players Association executive board during an online meeting was a move for continuity ahead of the likely start in April of what figures to be contentious collective bargaining.]}], url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb/2026/02/18/mlbpa-names-bruce-meyer-interim-executive-director, ampLink=null, anchorId=promo-790001, audio=[], audioDuration=null, _template=/page/promo/PagePromo.hbs, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/associated-press, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, bio=[{items=[The Associated Press is an independent, not-for-profit news cooperative headquartered in New York City.

Plymouth Court. The 0.35-acre site includes a city-owned parking structure that will be demolished, as well as three parcels of vacant land. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leon Walker, CEO and founder of DL3 Realty, said it's a site that’s been neglected for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think this is a diamond in the rough that needs to be lifted up and polished off so that people could really appreciate the opportunity we present here,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acoda will have 300 apartments, with 20% affordable, according to the city’s Department of Planning and Development. There will also be ground-floor retail and restaurant space, a co-working space, live-work lofts and 60 parking spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project, designed by architecture firm Perkins &amp;amp; Will, is eligible for up to $5 million in grant funding from the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"As we continue to confront the housing shortage head-on, I'm thrilled the city is supporting this 300-unit project that includes 60 much-needed affordable homes for the Loop,\" Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a news release. \"The investment will empower people from all walks of life to live in the beating heart of our city, extending job opportunities as well as access to public transit and Chicago's numerous cultural and community amenities.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a60000\" name=\"image-a60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0413269/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1227x689+0+459/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2F0b%2F7fafdab149e3864a872065b97045%2F331-s-plymouth-image2.jpeg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1fe15b5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1227x689+0+459/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2F0b%2F7fafdab149e3864a872065b97045%2F331-s-plymouth-image2.jpeg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e7a5a51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1227x689+0+459/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2F0b%2F7fafdab149e3864a872065b97045%2F331-s-plymouth-image2.jpeg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Rendering of DL3 Realty&amp;#x27;s 25-story high-rise Acoda\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e7a5a51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1227x689+0+459/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2F0b%2F7fafdab149e3864a872065b97045%2F331-s-plymouth-image2.jpeg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53a3cbd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1227x689+0+459/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2F0b%2F7fafdab149e3864a872065b97045%2F331-s-plymouth-image2.jpeg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e7a5a51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1227x689+0+459/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2F0b%2F7fafdab149e3864a872065b97045%2F331-s-plymouth-image2.jpeg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rendering of DL3 Realty’s 25-story high-rise, Acoda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of the Chicago Department of Planning and Development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;DL3 Realty is also committing at least $1.5 million to upgrade the adjacent Pritzker Park, at Van Buren and State streets. Improvements will include a performance space, improved lighting and public art, according to the planning department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the same block, at 22 W. Van Buren St., was a building used as &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2020/6/21/21296462/blues-brothers-film-flophouse-hotel-chicago-downtown-l-train-movies-plymouth-hotel\"   &gt;Elwood Blues’ apartment&lt;/a&gt; in the movie \"The Blues Brothers,\" which was filmed in and around Chicago. But that portion of the block was demolished in 1990, according to the planning department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker said he thinks Acoda is a great opportunity for a live, work and play environment, especially as buildings Downtown &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/04/25/office-residential-conversions-apartments-housing-downtown\"   &gt;continue to be converted&lt;/a&gt; for other uses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The property's live-work units will be like duplexes: The first floor will have space for tenants to work and host meetings, while the second floor will serve as the private living quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We find that to be incredibly attractive to emerging entrepreneurs and others who just can't afford to pay two rents while they're getting their business off the ground,” Walker said. “Every time we put live-works out, we have a waiting list for those that want to rent those units.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acoda will complement the city’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2024/04/03/mayor-johnson-proposing-150m-tif-assistance-lasalle-street-revamp\"   &gt;LaSalle Corridor Revitalization&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative to convert office buildings into apartments, with many of them affordable. DL3 is part of the development team overhauling the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/architecture-design/2025/07/09/landmarks-commission-lasalle-street-art-deco-field-building-skyscraper\"   &gt;Field Building&lt;/a&gt;, which will create 386 new apartments, in addition to retail space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Plymouth Court project is one of a few opportunities in the Loop for new, ground-up construction, Walker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Downtown has slumped and gone through its changes after COVID in terms of how we work and live,” Walker said. “There's a great opportunity to make this a live, work, learn and play environment, but we need new buildings and new product to make that happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site’s zoning hasn’t been determined and could require a planned development designation, according to planning department Deputy Commissioner Peter Strazzabosco. The land sale will include a redevelopment agreement requiring the City Council's approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planning department said the proposed $3.8 million purchase price is the site’s market value. The sale hasn’t closed yet, but Walker said the firm is aiming to break ground in 2027, with construction taking about 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;",

The deal barely avoided what would have been the first loss of regular-season games since 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meyer spent 30 years at Weil, Gotshal &amp;amp; Manges before joining the NHL Players Association in 2016 as senior director of collective bargaining, policy and legal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three members of the union's eight-man executive subcommittee, Jack Flaherty, Lucas Giolito and Ian Happ, were among the players who in March 2024 advocated for the ouster of Meyer in an effort led by former union lawyer Harry Marino. Clark backed Meyer, the effort failed and those three players were dropped off the subcommittee that December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subcommittee voted 8-0 against approving the 2022 labor contract and Meyer had advocated pushing management for a deal more favorable to the union. Team player representatives, the overall group supervising negotiations, voted 26-4 in favor, leaving the overall ballot at 26-12 for ratification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current subcommittee includes Chris Bassitt, Jake Cronenworth, Pete Fairbanks, Cedric Mullins, Marcus Semien, Paul Skenes, Tarik Skubal and Brent Suter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Loomis St. in Little Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Park District selected Cabrini after whittling down 157 nominated figures to eight candidates. In a public vote, nearly 1,500 of the 3,900 votes were cast for Cabrini. Other nominations included Renato Dulbecco, Enrico Fermi, Phillip Mazzei, Maria Montessori, Florence Scala, Antonin Scalia and Amerigo Vespucci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artists interested in creating the sculpture can submit an application &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/dcase_opportunities.html.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;online starting March 1&lt;/a&gt;. Upon completion, the statue will be owned by the City of Chicago and displayed in the seven-acre park on the Near West Side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cabrini was an Italian-born missionary nun who founded the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, through which she helped build dozens of schools, hospitals and orphanages across the Americas and Europe. She is half of the namesake of the Cabrini-Green homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e20000\" name=\"image-e20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/489b96d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5353x3004+0+282/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff0%2F79%2Facb494d053fd12204b61f4990e25%2Fcolumbus-statue.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c28f76c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5353x3004+0+282/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff0%2F79%2Facb494d053fd12204b61f4990e25%2Fcolumbus-statue.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/245dadd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5353x3004+0+282/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff0%2F79%2Facb494d053fd12204b61f4990e25%2Fcolumbus-statue.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A poster of Italian Americans stands, surrounded by Italian and American flags, in the spot where a statue of Christopher Columbus once stood in Arrigo Park in Little Italy.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/245dadd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5353x3004+0+282/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff0%2F79%2Facb494d053fd12204b61f4990e25%2Fcolumbus-statue.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/026a5a7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5353x3004+0+282/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff0%2F79%2Facb494d053fd12204b61f4990e25%2Fcolumbus-statue.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/245dadd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5353x3004+0+282/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff0%2F79%2Facb494d053fd12204b61f4990e25%2Fcolumbus-statue.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A poster, which was set up by the Joint Civic Committee of Italian Americans, is displayed at Arrigo Park in the Little Italy neighborhood in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times (file)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was made the patron saint of immigrants in 1950, four years after more than 100,000 people attended a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/11/11/18471565/at-the-shrine-of-first-u-s-saint-who-came-to-america-as-an-immigrant\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;celebratory mass at Soldier Field&lt;/a&gt; for her receiving sainthood.

Her work reflects Chicago at its best: a city that rises by lifting others. This monument at Arrigo Park will honor her enduring legacy and all of the communities who continue to shape our city.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Mayor Lori Lightfoot &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2020/7/27/21340773/christopher-columbus-statues-grant-arrigo-park-removal-protests\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;removed the park’s Columbus statue&lt;/a&gt;, as well as two other Columbus statues in the city, in 2020 after they became targets of vandalism during the civic unrest following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Columbus statue in Arrigo Park has been loaned to the Joint Civic Committee of Italian Americans for display in an upcoming Chicago Museum of Italian Immigration on Taylor Street. The deal is part of a settlement between the group and the park district resolving &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2022/8/3/23290728/christopher-columbus-statues-chicago-grant-arrigo-park-protests-talian-american-lawsuit-lightfoot\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;a long-running lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; following the statue's removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last remnants of the Columbus statue were &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2025/07/24/columbus-statue-pedestal-removal-grant-park-rotating-art\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;removed from Grant Park in July&lt;/a&gt;, and were expected to be replaced by rotating art installations to “celebrate Chicago’s diverse communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mother Cabrini’s dedication to advancing equity, justice and inclusivity for the marginalized immigrant communities aligns with the Park District’s promise to make parks accessible to all,” Chicago Park District General Supt. and CEO Carlos Ramirez-Rosa said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;",

They say the action violates the separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Illinois, six grant awards to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of Illinois-Chicago that are collectively worth over $20 million — which Raoul said are to “make the electricity grid more reliable and resilient, reduce carbon emissions, and utilize domestic sources of rare earth elements and critical minerals” — were on the chopping block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This unlawful attempt to block funding approved by Congress will seriously harm work being done in Illinois and across the nation to improve energy efficiency, strengthen energy resiliency and increase clean energy – all of which benefit the public,” Raoul said in a statement. “I will continue to stand with my fellow attorneys general to fight back against the president’s illegal actions that harm our communities and our environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Energy didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also signed on to the suit are the attorney generals of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raoul and other attorneys general have been mounting legal wins, the latest of which came a week ago when &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/health/2026/02/12/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-trump-cuts-to-hiv-lead-poisoning-prevention-funds\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a federal judge temporarily blocked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration from cutting more than &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2026/02/10/trump-administration-cuts-illinois-hiv-prevention-grants\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;$600 million in public health grants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Illinois and three other Democratic-led states — just a day after Raoul joined a coalition of states in a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/health/2026/02/11/federal-cuts-hiv-lead-poisoning-prevention-grants-raoul\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;federal lawsuit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to challenge the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, in response to another suit from Raoul and other legal officials, a federal appeals court &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/health/2026/01/06/appeals-court-kwame-raoul-trump-administration-medical-research\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;ruled to restore medical research funding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cut by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Raoul was part of a large coalition of legal officials that won a suit for the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/09/24/illinois-wins-suit-on-disaster-relief-funding-held-by-dhs-over-sanctuary-laws\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;release of $2 billion in federal disaster relief funding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; held up by the White House over sanctuary city policies.

The school was called North Division when it knocked off Austin to win the championship in 1904. It was renamed Waller and then became Lincoln Park in the late 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This season, the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/02/15/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;No. 21 Lions&lt;/a&gt; are one of the most talented teams in the Public League but didn't live up to expectations early in the season. Lincoln Park even had a key player transfer to a prep school in late December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coach Josh Anderson, a former Simeon star and the son of former NBA player Nick Anderson, guided the team through the rough start and relished his team’s 52-43 win against No. 25 Hyde Park in the Public League playoff semifinals on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2026/02/18/chicago-illinois-high-school-basketball-scores\"   &gt;Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; at UIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hours in the gym, hours of film,” Anderson said. “They’ve built a bond. Every season they grew. We hung our hat on the work. When you are 16 and 17 it is about maturity. They have taken to the coaching and they have matured.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Ahmad Lee and senior forward Larry Harris lived up to their potential under the bright lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The losses we took this season were not because of the teams we were playing,” Harris said. “It was because of ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee, a fast and dynamic guard, finished with 17 points, six assists and four rebounds. Harris, an athletic leaper, added 17 points and seven rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their two best players were their two best players,” Hyde Park coach Jerrel Oliver said. “Everything we said we would try to stop, we didn’t stop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kye Ward-Owens scored with 4:28 left to pull the Thunderbirds within 39-34, but Lincoln Park (20-7) shot 11-for-14 from the free throw line in the fourth quarter to seal the win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was part of the growth and maturity, the hours of free throws,” Anderson said. “There were some days where we weren’t doing anything but free throws. Getting that footwork down. I am proud of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lions knocked off highly-regarded Peoria Richwoods last week and have played one of the most challenging schedules in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This feels great,” Lee said. “One more game. The Richwoods game helped us a lot. That big win was great for our chemistry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Jaylen Dickerson scored 12 points and had five assists for the Lions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We always had belief,” Dickerson said. “We just needed to mature and we did.

For the past six years, we have been caring for aging parents. My father-in-law, who had Alzheimer's, passed away a few years ago. We went through a lot with him as his illness progressed. My mother-in-law is 87 and does not want to go into a nursing home. She still lives by herself, but my sister-in-law and I take turns cooking and bringing her food, and my husband works his tail off cutting the grass and doing maintenance and repairs she can no longer do. Although we are retired, our lives revolve around her needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently had a conversation with my daughter, my only child. She has three sets of parents — us, my ex and his wife and her husband's parents. She said she loves us, but she doesn't want to take care of any of us. When she retires, she wants to enjoy her retirement, travel and not have to worry about caring for anybody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having gone through it myself, I understand her feelings. Nobody WANTS to do this. At the same time, I'm a little hurt. All that we have — money, cars, house — is set up to go to her after we pass. Now it looks like we may need it to pay for assisted living. Abby, is it normal for kids these days to refuse to help aging parents? — &lt;i&gt;REVISING PLANS IN MISSOURI&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR REVISING:&lt;/b&gt; I don't know whether it has become \"normal,\" but it is not unusual. Woe to any parent who assumes their children will take care of them, because it doesn't always turn out that way. Be glad your daughter is speaking up now, so you can plan accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; I lost my beloved mother-in-law five years ago. Since then, my father-in-law has become engaged to a woman who, frankly, is not liked by anyone in our family. She's unkind and dismissive, and her presence creates tension at family gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have now announced their wedding date, which happens to fall on my birthday. This has hit me hard. My parents have both passed away, and my birthday has always been a cherished day, filled with memories and meaning. It was one of the few days I felt truly celebrated. Now, I worry that every future birthday will be overshadowed by their anniversary and the complicated emotions tied to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would it be selfish or inappropriate to ask them to consider a different date? I don't want to cause drama, but I also feel deeply hurt. How do I navigate this without making things worse? — &lt;i&gt;TORN BETWEEN GRACE AND GRIEF&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR TORN:&lt;/b&gt; I am sorry for your disappointment, but the date of your birth does not belong solely to you. It's clear that you disapprove of your father-in-law's choice of a second wife, and I sincerely hope you will be able to adjust. I do not think it will go over well if you approach the happy couple and ask them to change the date of their nuptials to accommodate you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

A grand jury &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://reason.com/2026/02/11/a-grand-jury-rejects-trumps-attempt-to-prosecute-6-legislators-for-saying-something-he-did-not-like/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; a proposed indictment against six legislators who &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://reason.com/2025/11/21/trump-says-legislators-committed-treason-by-noting-that-soldiers-are-not-obligated-to-obey-unlawful-orders/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;produced a video&lt;/a&gt; reminding U.S. military personnel of their duty to \"refuse illegal orders,\" and a federal judge &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://reason.com/2026/02/13/a-federal-judge-explains-why-trump-cant-jail-legislators-for-producing-a-video-that-offended-him/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; why any such prosecution would be blatantly unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-340000\" name=\"module-340000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nov. 18 &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iux161DZAA\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;video&lt;/a&gt; did not identify any specific \"illegal orders.\" But it is not hard to imagine how the issue might arise in the context of Trump's &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://reason.com/2026/01/21/the-insurrection-act-which-trump-keeps-threatening-to-invoke-is-alarmingly-vague-and-broad/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;domestic military deployments&lt;/a&gt; or his &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/10/trumps-word-games-cant-conceal-the-murderous-reality-of-his-anti-drug-strategy/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;murderous campaign&lt;/a&gt; against suspected cocaine smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115582417825161974\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the two senators and four representatives who produced the video \"should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL.\" But he had trouble explaining what crime they supposedly had committed by reiterating the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/llmlp/2024_Operational_Law_Handbook/2024_Operational_Law_Handbook.pdf#page=91\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;well-established principle&lt;/a&gt; that members of the armed forces \"have a duty to disobey\" orders that are \"manifestly illegal.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump called the legislators \"TRAITORS\" who had engaged in \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR.\" But nothing they did came close to meeting the elements of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;treason&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2384\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;seditious conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Justice Department was determined to deliver on Trump's threat, as it clearly was, it needed a different option. Jeanine Pirro, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, reportedly settled on a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title18-section2387&amp;amp;num=0&amp;amp;edition=prelim\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;statute&lt;/a&gt; that applies to someone who \"causes or attempts to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty by any member of the military or naval forces of the United States.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That offense is a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. But it requires an \"intent to interfere with, impair, or influence the loyalty, morale, or discipline of the military or naval forces of the United States.\" And the Uniform Code of Military Justice &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-section891&amp;amp;num=0&amp;amp;edition=prelim\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;defines&lt;/a&gt; insubordination as willfully disobeying \"a lawful order,\" while the video explicitly addressed \"illegal orders.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grand juries, which hear only the government's side of a case, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.ballardspahr.com/insights/alerts-and-articles/2025/10/revenge-of-the-ham-sandwich-recent-no-bills-test-prosecutors-grand-jury-dominance\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;almost always&lt;/a&gt; approve charges recommended by federal prosecutors. But in this case, a grand jury in Washington, D.C., &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/10/us/politics/trump-democrats-illegal-orders-pirro.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;declined&lt;/a&gt; to cooperate with Trump's vendetta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, a George W. Bush appointee, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.288365/gov.uscourts.dcd.288365.37.0_2.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the video was \"unquestionably protected\" by the First Amendment. Leon was responding to a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.288365/gov.uscourts.dcd.288365.1.0_1.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; by Sen. Mark Kelly, D–Ariz., a retired Navy captain whom Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/976475073/Read-Hegseth-letter-to-Kelly\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;censured&lt;/a&gt; for the video and other public comments that offended him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hegseth, who equated criticism of him with \"conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline,\" sought to punish Kelly, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, by reducing his retirement rank and pension. He warned that the senator could face \"criminal prosecution or further administrative action\" if he continued to say things Hegseth did not like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leon issued a preliminary injunction barring Hegseth from following through on those threats while the case is pending. Although that decision was limited to Kelly, its logic also condemns any further attempts to treat the video as a crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Under any reading of the law,\" Leon noted, Kelly's statements \"constitute 'speech on matters of public concern' and are therefore 'entitled to special protection.'\" Like the Republican senators who criticized Obama's military policies, Kelly and his Democratic colleagues indisputably have a right, as Americans and as legislators charged with overseeing the Pentagon, to speak their minds, even when it irks the president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jacob Sullum is a senior editor at Reason magazine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-d30000\" name=\"module-d30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

No one was seriously injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crash and Officer Carlos Baker’s accidental firing of the Taser and failure to report the chase raise new questions about why he subsequently, in early 2025, was &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2026/01/15/chicago-police-department-carlos-baker-krystal-rivera-gresham-district-jon-hein\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;allowed to join a tactical team&lt;/a&gt;, a competitive position, in the Gresham District on the South Side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief of Patrol Jon Hein rejected Baker’s first application to the tactical team in the spring of 2024, citing Baker’s poor disciplinary record. The car crash happened seven weeks later, in June 2024. In January 2025, Baker applied a second time, again after Gresham District Cmdr. Michel Tate recommended him. This time, Hein approved it even though police brass knew about the additional infractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2025, three months after joining the tactical team, Baker &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2025/06/05/chicago-police-officer-shot-cpd-crime-shooting\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;shot and killed his partner&lt;/a&gt;, Officer Krystal Rivera, as they chased a man into an apartment building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-900000\" name=\"image-900000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/59a6671/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+198/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2b%2F32%2F3a0bd2ee4093b469f6246be0b191%2F14df0e91-00ba-4b92-86fc-affa090b7b9f.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/be6c73e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+198/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2b%2F32%2F3a0bd2ee4093b469f6246be0b191%2F14df0e91-00ba-4b92-86fc-affa090b7b9f.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/212dcef/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+198/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2b%2F32%2F3a0bd2ee4093b469f6246be0b191%2F14df0e91-00ba-4b92-86fc-affa090b7b9f.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Chicago police Officer Carlos Baker.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/212dcef/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+198/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2b%2F32%2F3a0bd2ee4093b469f6246be0b191%2F14df0e91-00ba-4b92-86fc-affa090b7b9f.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bf2ec5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+198/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2b%2F32%2F3a0bd2ee4093b469f6246be0b191%2F14df0e91-00ba-4b92-86fc-affa090b7b9f.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/212dcef/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+198/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2b%2F32%2F3a0bd2ee4093b469f6246be0b191%2F14df0e91-00ba-4b92-86fc-affa090b7b9f.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago police Officer Carlos Baker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Police Department&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Rivera’s family wouldn’t comment.

The pursuit happened within a roughly one-square-mile residential area bounded by 79th and 89th streets and Halsted Street and Ashland Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jeep reached speeds of up to 90 miles an hour, and Baker’s police SUV hit 85 mph, records show. Baker and his partner didn't turn on their car’s emergency lights or in-car camera, so the crash wasn’t captured on video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the officers didn’t notify anyone that they were involved in a high-speed chase until after the crash, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-140000\" name=\"image-140000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fca99f6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1612x905+0+200/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F11%2Fa90f34ee4901bf85489959cfd97e%2Fbaker-crash-diagram.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9458f9b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1612x905+0+200/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F11%2Fa90f34ee4901bf85489959cfd97e%2Fbaker-crash-diagram.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4735062/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1612x905+0+200/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F11%2Fa90f34ee4901bf85489959cfd97e%2Fbaker-crash-diagram.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A police diagram of the seven-vehicle crash near 89th Street and Racine Avenue on June 19, 2024. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4735062/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1612x905+0+200/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F11%2Fa90f34ee4901bf85489959cfd97e%2Fbaker-crash-diagram.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/356104a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1612x905+0+200/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F11%2Fa90f34ee4901bf85489959cfd97e%2Fbaker-crash-diagram.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4735062/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1612x905+0+200/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F11%2Fa90f34ee4901bf85489959cfd97e%2Fbaker-crash-diagram.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A police diagram of the seven-vehicle crash near 89th Street and Racine Avenue on June 19, 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Police Department&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Footage from Baker’s body camera shows him opening the driver’s-side door as the SUV is still moving and car horns are blaring amid the wreckage. He and his partner then start chasing an 18-year-old man down a gangway, according to the video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The footage shows Baker firing his Taser once at the teen after the younger man hopped a fence. The prongs “only [made] contact with” the man’s sweatshirt, though, and he kept running down the alley, according to the video and police records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker then pulled the trigger of his Taser a second time — “inadvertently,” he wrote in a report — as he tried to scale the fence next to a chained gate while holding the Taser in his right hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker’s partner found the teenager sitting on the front steps of a house with wrecked cars surrounding Baker’s marked police vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kDnZwZ9N6p8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Chicago police officer ‘inadvertently’ fired Taser a year before fatally shooting his partner\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker said he made his first Taser trigger pull because he believed the man he was chasing was “armed,” according to a use-of-force report filled out after the chase. His second trigger pull, described as unintentional, was disclosed in the same report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inadvertently, another trigger pull was activated on the Taser when I climbed the fence to locate offender,” Baker wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a week after the crash, a lieutenant filed a complaint against Baker, saying he never heard Baker and his partner report over the police radio that they were chasing the Jeep, as department policy requires. It doesn’t appear that any supervisor filed a complaint against Baker for mishandling the Taser, but his lieutenant and sergeant talked to him about “the importance of weapon retention,” police records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker told a sergeant he thought he followed the department’s balancing test for car chases, which requires officers to weigh the potential capture of criminals against the risk of hurting bystanders. The teenage driver was convicted of receiving or possessing a stolen vehicle and was sentenced to probation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Chicago has paid more than $100 million in recent years to pedestrians, drivers and passengers killed or &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2021/5/12/22425231/lori-lightfoot-chicago-police-vehicle-pursuit-policy-emails\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;injured during police pursuits&lt;/a&gt;

The ex-detective said threats and physical abuse were less effective at getting information from suspects than developing a trustful connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rapport building is the only thing that works and the only thing that’s reliable,” Zuley said, denying he so much as raised his voice while extracting Garrett’s confession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The testimony contrasted with alleged Zuley ties to coercion in numerous other Cook County cases. It also clashed with a Sept. 11 terror suspect’s testimony that Zuley, as a Naval reservist, helped lead months of torture at Gitmo in a case made famous by the 2021 film drama starring Hollywood’s Jodie Foster and Benedict Cumberbatch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 9 a.m. Oct. 13, 1992, Dantrell was walking to school with his mother when a sniper shot him from an upper floor of a building at Cabrini Green, a former North Side public housing complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuley and his partner arrived on the scene that day at 10:30 a.m., he testified Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers, he testified, told him their “subject” was Garrett. Zuley admitted Wednesday the designation was based on hearsay: One of Dantrell’s relatives had told police a woman known as “Hollywood” had stated she saw Garrett climbing the building’s stairwell carrying a rifle shortly before 9:00 a.m. Hollywood was never identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once police found Garrett, Zuley testified, a security guard told the officers they had the wrong man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Zuley said he and his partner drove Garrett to a detective station at Western and Belmont avenues. Garrett ended up in an interrogation room with an eyebolt drilled into the wall for shackling people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuley said Garrett named witnesses who could corroborate he was on a Cabrini playground when the shooting took place. And the former detective acknowledged that three witnesses said they had seen Garrett outside, not upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it was after the shooting, after he had fled the scene and went downstairs,” Zuley testified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later in the day, Zuley said, “we told him he was under arrest because his alibi witnesses didn’t hold up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuley testified that he and Garrett then had a 45-minute “conversation” in which the two discussed something they had in common: military experience. The detective was a Marine veteran; the suspect had served in the Army.“He was a gentleman,” Zuley said. “He was respectful. He was responsive. And, for lack of a better word, I liked him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that exchange, according to Zuley, Garrett shared information relevant to Dantrell’s killing. “He said he was a shot expert with the M-16,” Zuley said, referring to a military marksmanship rating and an assault-rifle model that was “consistent with ammunition recovered from the scene.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuley said those details convinced him Garrett was the sniper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuley insisted he didn’t handcuff Garrett to the eye bolt or know of any one else at the station doing so. He said the room’s temperature was comfortable. He said he brought Garrett meals. He denied any physical or mental abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Garrett claims &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://tirc.illinois.gov/content/dam/soi/en/web/tirc/documents/decisions/2023.4.19-GARRETT-determination-referral-stamped.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;various mistreatment&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. At one point, he says, two large men in sports jerseys entered the room while he was handcuffed to the eyebolt. One of them, he says, repeatedly struck Garrett with a black rubber hose on his leg, where he had a steel rod implanted due to a 1984 gunshot wound that shattered the bone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuley left other detectives in charge of Garrett overnight. He returned the next morning and told the suspect, “I don’t believe you deliberately shot a little boy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuley said Garrett, with head bowed, “spoke in this little, weak voice” and confessed, saying he fired in short bursts at members of a rival gang near Dantrell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was remorseful,” Zuley testified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interrogation lasted nearly two days. Garrett eventually signed a handwritten statement admitting to Dantrell’s murder. He was convicted in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-b60000\" name=\"image-b60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1898a71/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1399x785+0+105/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F38%2Fad%2F1f3f97414f1bbc4c375fd94bea00%2Fimage-7.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/39e1746/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1399x785+0+105/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F38%2Fad%2F1f3f97414f1bbc4c375fd94bea00%2Fimage-7.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7c19f4b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1399x785+0+105/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F38%2Fad%2F1f3f97414f1bbc4c375fd94bea00%2Fimage-7.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Dantrell Davis\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7c19f4b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1399x785+0+105/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F38%2Fad%2F1f3f97414f1bbc4c375fd94bea00%2Fimage-7.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cb81a88/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1399x785+0+105/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F38%2Fad%2F1f3f97414f1bbc4c375fd94bea00%2Fimage-7.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7c19f4b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1399x785+0+105/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F38%2Fad%2F1f3f97414f1bbc4c375fd94bea00%2Fimage-7.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dantrell Davis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun-Times file photo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imprisoned at downstate Centralia Correctional Center, Garrett, 67, is not scheduled for release until 2039, according to the Illinois Department of Corrections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He entered Circuit Judge Adrienne E. Davis’s courtroom Wednesday in a blue button-down shirt issued by the prison. At the sight of family members waving from the gallery, he broke into a big smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garrett’s proceedings stem from a 2023 referral by the Illinois Torture and Relief Commission that detailed an “overwhelming” history of “lengthy and consistent” complaints alleging psychological and physical torture involving Zuley, who was hired by the police department in 1970 and who worked more than three decades for the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To win Garrett a new trial, his attorneys are trying to show a “pattern and practice” of Zuley coercing confessions. In court filings, his attorneys have listed a string of Chicago murder cases between 1987 and 2003, in which a suspect alleged coercion involving Zuley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judges have vacated at least four murder convictions involving Zuley. The exonerees include Lathierial Boyd, Lee Harris, Carl Reed and David Wright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Garrett’s attorneys, Eric Bisby, pressed Zuley about several of these cases and about a 1993 massacre at a Brown’s Chicken restaurant in Palatine. Zuley testified he served a one-day suspension from the Police Department for filing a false report about that case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Alleged torture at Gitmo&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, more than a decade after Dantrell’s murder, Zuley took leave from the police department and went to Guantánamo as a Navy reservist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Trump’s administration has blocked Garrett’s attorneys from questioning Zuley about his work there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, however, the attorneys called Sept. 11 suspect Mohamedou Ould Slahi, 55, to testify via Zoom from Rotterdam, the Netherlands, where he was naturalized in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slahi said Zuley led “enhanced interrogation techniques” for months in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The torture allegedly included isolation, temperature extremes, beatings, sexual humiliation, sleep deprivation, waterboarding, barking dogs and a mock execution at sea. Round-the-clock sessions allegedly included strobe lights and a looped recording of the U.S. national anthem that, Slahi said, kept him from sleeping and praying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 70 days of Zuley-orchestrated torture, Slahi testified, the detective convinced him that U.S. authorities were allowing his mother to be kidnapped and raped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slahi, who knew Zuley as Capt. Collins, described an all-night boat ride and salt water forced down his throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the boat ride, Slahi testified, “I was taken on a bumpy road to a [detention] cell. Mr. Zuley said, ‘I told you not to f- - - with me.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He said, ‘I don’t give a f- - - about fairness. I care about saving lives.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slahi admitted he never saw Zuley lay a hand on him but added, “I don’t know because I was blindfolded. … I began to lose my mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of this, Slahi testified, he confessed to anything his interrogators fed him, starting with plans to attack Toronto’s CN Tower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Zuley came to me and said, ‘I’m very happy with you. You gave us 80%, and we need the 20%,” Slahi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, Slahi said, he falsely confirmed that many individuals had Al Qaeda links.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slahi was held at Guantánamo for 14 years without charges. He was released to his native Mauritania in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His memoirs about those years were published as a book that led to the film, “The Mauritanian,” directed by Kevin Macdonald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the November hearing, Assistant State’s Attorney William Meyer pressed Slahi about visits to Afghanistan in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slahi answered he was working for U.S. allies there and cut ties from Al Qaeda years before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Chicago Public Media, the owner of the Chicago Sun-Times and WBEZ, was also asked to participate in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People of color make up more than two-thirds of the city’s population, with Black and Latino people representing 26% and 30% of residents, respectively, according to the 2024 American Community Survey. Yet our findings last year showed that many of the city’s largest arts groups don’t have boards or staff that reflect city demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same is true for Joffrey Ballet and Goodman Theatre, which reported majority white boards and full-time staff.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;A standout is the Chicago Architecture Center, which has the most diverse board among all survey respondents so far. People of color account for more than half its members. The organization also nearly doubled the number of people of color on its full-time staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there was other progress to report. These groups also showed impact through programming that reflects the diversity of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, for example, the Joffrey Ballet presented “Matters of the Heart,” which featured works by female choreographers of color. When hundreds of Chicago Public School students were invited to attend a show for free, they were enthralled by the diverse group of dancers, said Greg Cameron, Joffrey’s president and chief executive officer. “You could have heard a pin drop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three institutions say they plan to forge ahead with their diversity, equity and inclusion plans and programming, even as the Trump administration criticizes and cuts arts funding for such efforts. Both the Chicago Architecture Center and the Joffrey Ballet lost grants from the National Endowment for the Arts last year. The Joffrey also said it&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;declined a $60,000 grant from the federal agency that required it to forgo its DEI commitments. And each organization has kept its DEI language on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no world in which we would ever retreat from those values or commitments,” said John Collins, executive director of the Goodman Theatre. “We'll just have to be prepared to weather the storm. Frankly, if all of the people who have invested in us, who have trusted us, who have spent their money to come here, if they saw us start to retreat from those values, that's where the real risk of damage to the Goodman would have been.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-100000\" name=\"html-embed-module-100000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-table\" data-src=\"visualisation/27545285\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27545285/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"table visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Organizations report some progress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When WBEZ/Sun-Times conducted the survey last year, the Chicago Architecture Center said it was unable to meet the four-week deadline. The Goodman Theatre said it did not immediately see the requests to complete the survey, and the Joffrey Ballet declined without reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It wasn't because there was anything that anybody was trying to hide,” Cameron said. “There are so many surveys that we are bombarded with from funders, national organizations and students doing research projects. And I think there was just a feeling that, ‘We'll take a breather on this one.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each organization has made a public diversity commitment. As part of its “Joffrey for All” initiative, the Joffrey Ballet promises to create a “welcoming and accessible” environment. The Chicago Architecture Center pledges to remove recruitment, retention and advancement “barriers” for staff from underrepresented groups. And the Goodman Theatre has set specific goals to increase diverse representation on its board and creative teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2021 and 2025, The Goodman Theatre and the Joffrey Ballet each increased the share of people of color on its boards. While the Chicago Architecture Center did not track board diversity in 2021, it reported a leading rate of 51% for board members of color in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-370000\" name=\"image-370000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7a9bbdb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0d%2F63%2Fa69d3e6b4aa5b1f7c313d901ff3f%2Fopenhouse-101622-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fc1f70c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0d%2F63%2Fa69d3e6b4aa5b1f7c313d901ff3f%2Fopenhouse-101622-1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9d6e3ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0d%2F63%2Fa69d3e6b4aa5b1f7c313d901ff3f%2Fopenhouse-101622-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"People tour the Givins Castle, located at 10255 S.

The Joffrey was an outlier, more than doubling the number of its Latino board members between 2021 and 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the organizations say they are strengthening board recruitment efforts by empowering governance committees or probing community networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But finding the right fit takes time, Cameron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a priority for the Joffrey to see its board change,” he said. “There are lots of people that love the Joffrey, but they’re not interested in putting in the hard work and the commitment to being a board member.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-580000\" name=\"html-embed-module-580000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\" data-src=\"visualisation/27545292\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27545292/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"scatter visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to diversifying staff, the Goodman and Chicago Architecture Center said that the share of people of color in full-time positions increased. (The Goodman was not able to provide demographic data specifically for full-time employees in 2021, but did share 2020 data.) The Chicago Architecture Center doubled the number of Black employees and added multiple Latino employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Joffrey Ballet reported a minor decrease in its share of people of color on its full-time staff. Cameron said the pace of diversifying staff has slowed in part because many employees have remained in their roles for years. The group looks to a fellowship program to help identify and develop diverse candidates for future positions in arts management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goodman Theatre said it is also taking steps to ensure its organization can be a place where employees of color can thrive.That means providing implicit bias training, teaching about microaggressions, and constantly soliciting feedback, Collins said. Many of these efforts were put into place following the murder of George Floyd and subsequent &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/theater/2025/11/07/we-see-you-white-american-theatre-diversity-equity-inclusion-arts-chicago-dei\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;demand for more equity from theater artists of color&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To receive that feedback, we needed to take a moment and make sure that we did not immediately become defensive,” Collins said. “That was how we met that moment: trying to be open and honest with ourselves and really hold up that mirror, and bring some artists into a conversation about what their experiences here had been, and letting them be part of a solution. We're much more aware of who's around the table when decisions are being made.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f10000\" name=\"image-f10000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6fa3cfa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x4849+0+456/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2F96%2F1a80a31c4af8b96f08c5e9597549%2Fjoffrey-company-artists-anais-bueno-and-dylan-gutierrez-in-annabelle-lopez-ochoas-broken-wings-photo-by-todd-rosenberg-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/330bfc7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x4849+0+456/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2F96%2F1a80a31c4af8b96f08c5e9597549%2Fjoffrey-company-artists-anais-bueno-and-dylan-gutierrez-in-annabelle-lopez-ochoas-broken-wings-photo-by-todd-rosenberg-2.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/998f255/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x4849+0+456/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2F96%2F1a80a31c4af8b96f08c5e9597549%2Fjoffrey-company-artists-anais-bueno-and-dylan-gutierrez-in-annabelle-lopez-ochoas-broken-wings-photo-by-todd-rosenberg-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Joffrey Company Artists Anais Bueno and Dylan Gutierrez in Annabelle Lopez Ochoa&amp;#x27;s &amp;#x27;Broken Wings&amp;#x27; Photo by Todd Rosenberg (2).jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/998f255/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x4849+0+456/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2F96%2F1a80a31c4af8b96f08c5e9597549%2Fjoffrey-company-artists-anais-bueno-and-dylan-gutierrez-in-annabelle-lopez-ochoas-broken-wings-photo-by-todd-rosenberg-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/486a02f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x4849+0+456/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2F96%2F1a80a31c4af8b96f08c5e9597549%2Fjoffrey-company-artists-anais-bueno-and-dylan-gutierrez-in-annabelle-lopez-ochoas-broken-wings-photo-by-todd-rosenberg-2.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/998f255/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x4849+0+456/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2F96%2F1a80a31c4af8b96f08c5e9597549%2Fjoffrey-company-artists-anais-bueno-and-dylan-gutierrez-in-annabelle-lopez-ochoas-broken-wings-photo-by-todd-rosenberg-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, the Joffrey Ballet presented “Matters of the Heart,” a program that featured works by female choreographers of color and included a ballet inspired by artist Frida Kahlo.

The pilot cohort was 60% African American and 20% Latino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always want people to think of the Chicago Architecture Center as a resource for anything that they need in their community as it relates to architecture, but also [to show] the impact design has on their community,” said Simone Edwards, who is the organization’s chief financial officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Joffrey forged ahead with its annual “Winning Works” program again last year, despite losing a $20,000 National Endowment for the Arts grant that supported it. For more than 15 years, the Joffrey Ballet has presented the program highlighting choreography from African, Latinx, Asian, Arab, and Native American artists who have been “historically excluded” from ballet. The program – returning in March – is evolving to also reflect and represent diversity of gender and age, the LGBTQ+ community and those who are disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We really want to show the broadest sense of what diversity, equity and inclusion looks like,” Cameron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goodman is also working to expand its diversity programming, offering everything from stage productions like \"Fat Ham\" (\"Hamlet\" reimagined in the Deep South) and \"Lucha Teotl\" (co-produced with the Chicago Latin Theater Alliance) to free workshops for teens that are now offered year-round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, a diverse group of young people gathered at the theater for a playwriting workshop taught by playwright-in-residence Lachrisa Grandberry. They were instructed to stand by the theater’s floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking North Dearborn Street and watch as people walked by. They also studied artists eating in the building’s busy dining hall. They used their observations to sketch out scenes, monologues and dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-560000\" name=\"image-560000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3bea086/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6788x3810+0+358/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F79%2F36%2F2a5951c449dbafcf350ab31408a4%2Ffloydfolo-260215-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba2222c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6788x3810+0+358/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F79%2F36%2F2a5951c449dbafcf350ab31408a4%2Ffloydfolo-260215-10.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c1bcb0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6788x3810+0+358/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F79%2F36%2F2a5951c449dbafcf350ab31408a4%2Ffloydfolo-260215-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Students write observations about people on the street during “Teen Studio: the Writer’s Room,” a teen playwriting workshop, at the Goodman Theatre in the Loop, Saturday, Jan. 17, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c1bcb0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6788x3810+0+358/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F79%2F36%2F2a5951c449dbafcf350ab31408a4%2Ffloydfolo-260215-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3655ddd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6788x3810+0+358/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F79%2F36%2F2a5951c449dbafcf350ab31408a4%2Ffloydfolo-260215-10.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c1bcb0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6788x3810+0+358/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F79%2F36%2F2a5951c449dbafcf350ab31408a4%2Ffloydfolo-260215-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goodman is working to expand its diversity programming, offering everything from stage productions to free workshops for teens that are now offered year-round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It inspired me a lot,” said Sanya Agarwal, 13, who is in the 8th grade at Scullen Middle School in Naperville. “I was kind of nervous at first, but I had a really fun time.

But in 2017, Republican lawmakers, under President Donald Trump’s first term, imposed a $10,000 limit on SALT deductions with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years that followed, many elected officials opposed the $10,000 cap, which remained in place under former President Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It never should have been put in place to begin with,” Gov. JB Pritzker said at a news conference last July. “I think raising it is a good thing for the state of Illinois.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SALT deduction changes will most likely help wealthier taxpayers in high-tax states like Illinois, especially if they have many expenses to itemize. Because of Illinois’ high property taxes, some people who claimed the standard deduction may now find it worthwhile to itemize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the old cap, 14.7% of Illinois homeowners had property tax bills that exceeded $10,000. In the Chicago metro area, that figure jumped to 21.8%, according to Realtor.com. Rising reassessments have made bills even higher, particularly on the South and West sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to know about how the SALT deduction could affect your federal tax return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Defining the SALT deduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SALT deduction helps prevent double taxation — ensuring filers aren’t paying federal tax on income already taxed by state and local governments, which helps support services like schools, roads and public safety. The deduction is only available to filers who itemize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tax break includes property taxes plus local and state income taxes, or state and local sales taxes. Filers have to choose between deducting income taxes or sales taxes; it can’t be both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s new law increased the cap from $10,000 to $40,000 for most filers with up to $500,000 in household income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cap will increase annually by 1% through 2029, then fall back to $10,000 for the 2030 tax year. When a filer’s modified adjusted gross income reaches $500,000, the cap begins to phase out, reducing their deduction by 30% of their excess MAGI (modified adjusted gross income). But the cap doesn’t fall below, so filers who are fully phased out can still deduct up to $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Changes under Trump’s terms&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Trump's first administration, the SALT deduction raised more revenue to offset large tax cuts, placing greater costs on taxpayers in high-tax Democratic-leaning states such as California, New York and New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The tax cuts that Trump and the congressional Republicans wanted to put in place came with a price tag. … It was a way to essentially raise taxes on certain high net worth individuals by taking away or limiting a previous ability that they had to pay less in taxes,” said Justin Marlowe, municipal finance professor at the University of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act created a SALT cap, it nearly doubled the standard deduction, and about 30 million more people across the country opted to take the standard deduction rather than itemize, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Between 2017 and 2018, the standard deduction rose from $6,500 to $12,000 for single filers, from $13,000 to $24,000 for married filing jointly and from $9,550 to $18,000 for head of household.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act, signed in July 2025, made many tax changes from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, while introducing new tax breaks like \"no tax on tips\" and a senior deduction of up to $6,000 for those 65 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Those most likely to benefit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous $10,000 cap made the SALT deduction far less relevant for most taxpayers, said Nikhita Airi, research associate at the Tax Policy Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The center estimates about 10% of taxpayers nationwide will benefit from it in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middle- and high-income households are most likely to benefit, particularly in high-tax states such as California, New Jersey and New York, where residents pay more to finance state and local services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joel Berner, economist for Realtor.com, said the higher cap will make a big difference for some homeowners, especially in high-tax areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois has some of the highest property taxes in the country, according to the Tax Foundation. In Cook County, the median property tax bill was $6,053, with median bills ranging from $6,000 to $8,000 across counties in northeastern Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people pay high property taxes in the city and all over the suburbs, so this will allow more people to take advantage [and] get a higher deduction,” said Traci Wall, SALT manager at accounting firm RSM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, the previous cap “didn’t even cover all their property taxes, and they lost out on the state income tax deduction,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have indicated that raising the SALT cap could increase homeownership rates and lead people to spend more on property purchases or renovations, thereby increasing property values. Berner said he believes it will boost home values in Chicago and Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re not paying the same amount of property taxes, those savings get capitalized into the value of the home. People with more money in their pockets may be more willing to move. People who’ve been sitting on artificially low tax appraisal values and don’t want to give that up might now be more willing to move, so we anticipate a little more inventory for sale, slightly higher prices and more activity,” Berner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it could have mixed effects on housing affordability, as higher-income taxpayers may now be less interested in moving, Marlowe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It becomes a concern because you’ve given people who own property an additional incentive to stay in their properties and invest and drive property values up, and that certainly is not going to help the affordability problem in a lot of communities,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether SALT deductions encourage people to move to higher property tax jurisdictions is unclear, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Itemize vs. the standard deduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many take the standard deduction because it’s easier, requiring less work to document every expense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 2025 tax year, the standard deduction increased to $15,750 for singles, $23,625 for heads of household and $31,500 for joint households.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recent changes may make itemizing more appealing to households facing a higher property tax burden, said Mark Mirsky, certified public accountant and tax partner at Aprio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the SALT deduction, Illinois taxpayers can deduct their home’s mortgage interest, some medical expenses, charitable contributions and other expenses allowed by the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the president's tax and spending bill passed before the IRS updated its federal tax withholding tables, many tax filers will likely receive bigger refunds than usual this year, Mirsky said. But whether individual taxpayers actually benefit from the new SALT cap depends on how much they can itemize beyond the standard deduction, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that many taxpayers in their heads are thinking, ‘I’m paying less tax, given the new bill,’ but it’s clearly situational,\" he said. \"Refunds just mean you had more taken out of a check or that you paid the government more than you should have in advance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Things to consider when taking the SALT deduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to claim the SALT deduction, Wall said it’s time to start documenting everything, from charitable contributions to mortgage interest and property tax statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If your income taxes [and] property taxes are going to put you over [the standard deduction] or near it, you may want to consider some additional charitable giving [and] getting that in a particular tax year,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all of those combined don’t get you to the standard deduction, don’t itemize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SALT deduction also only benefits households with incomes below $500,000. Those above the income threshold may want to lower their modified adjusted gross income by contributing to retirement or health care savings accounts or documenting capital losses, Mirsky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charitable giving will not reduce your adjusted gross income, but will increase your total itemized deductions and potentially provide a greater tax benefit for your giving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Thatcher, CEO of Charity Navigator, is seeing more donors bunch multiple years’ worth of charitable contributions into a single year to increase their itemized deductions, while taking the standard deduction in other years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bunching charitable donations rather than spreading them over multiple years allows filers to deduct the most in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2022, many Illinoisans who own flow-through entities, such as partnerships or S corporations, have used the Pass-through Entity Tax to pay their state income taxes at the entity level while deducting them on their federal return, allowing them to deduct income above the cap. With the $40,000 SALT cap, Mirsky recommends speaking with a tax adviser to determine whether to continue this strategy.&lt;/p&gt;",

This means the remaining 10% is taxed even if total losses exceed or equal winnings — a sharp departure from previous years and a change that's gained bipartisan pushback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the previous law, a gambler who won $100,000 and lost $100,000 in a calendar year didn't have to report taxable income, as the losses offset their earnings. Under Trump’s tax plan, that same player would only be able to deduct up to 90% of their winnings, so they would have to pay federal income taxes on $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The result creates an unfair precedent by taxing phantom income and uniquely penalizing a legal, heavily regulated activity,\" the American Gaming Association said in a July letter to the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bills have been introduced to the U.S. House and Senate to repeal the 90% limitation, but neither bill has been passed, though there is strong bipartisan support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filers also should be aware of another key revision in the act regarding gambling-related deductions, according to Chris Altruda, a Logan Square-based senior gaming analyst for Ingame.com, which covers the regulated U.S. sports betting industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That 90% deduction now includes non-loss expenses, including subscriptions to data services, which were previously taxed separately,” Altruda said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another change under the sweeping tax and spending bill is an update to slot jackpot tax reporting. As of Jan. 1, 2026, the minimum reporting threshold is $2,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Department of Revenue said it allows the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/iw2g.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;federal threshold for withholding&lt;/a&gt;. \"The department is in the process of currently revising Pub 130 to reflect these changes, and once the document is finalized, it will be available on our website,\" Maura Kownacki, spokesperson for the Illinios Department of Revenue, said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, casinos had to issue a Form W-G to slot players who won $1,200 or more — a threshold that was in place since 1977. Gaming industry advocates have been pushing for years to have the threshold increased, saying it would reduce paperwork while also keeping up with inflation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keep detailed records&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government began taxing gambling income in 1951, in an effort to curtail organized crime and other illegal operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal income tax law classifies gambling winnings as ordinary, taxable income, and Illinois primarily follows federal tax laws. That means Illinois gambling winnings — from sports betting, lottery and casinos — also are bound to the state’s 4.95% flat income tax rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one significant contrast to federal law, the state prohibits deductions for any gambling losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing that hasn't changed under the new legislation is that the gambling deduction will remain an itemized deduction and should be reported on Schedule A. If a filer claims the standard deduction, they're still obligated to report and pay tax on all winnings earned during the year, and they won't be able to deduct any losses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois taxpayers must report:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-71faca90-ffff-11f0-8b29-bfddd1f94993\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Casino winnings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sports betting, in-person and online&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daily fantasy sports transactions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poker, slots, horse racing wagers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lotteries, raffles, bingo, charity gaming, and similar games of chance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts to expand third-party reporting is expected to capture more online and app-based gambling activity, as casinos and digital platforms become more integrated with IRS data systems, making underreporting more difficult, according to Mark Gallegos, partner at accounting firm Porte Brown in Elgin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The overall framework for taxing gambling hasn’t changed much, but beginning in 2026, the loss limitation becomes stricter, and the likelihood that the IRS receives independent information about gambling activity continues to increase,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Impacts on the gaming industry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a CNBC interview last August that the tax provision “doesn’t make sense,\" questioning how someone could “pay income tax on something that’s not actually income.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy changes could primarily affect professional players and big-stakes gamblers, who will see more of their winnings taxed, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That short list includes Gov. JB Pritzker, a noted poker player who has approved sports betting, the build-out of six new casinos and the expansion of slot machines across the state during his tenure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Pritzker’s campaign released 2024 tax documents showing he won &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/illinois-governor/2025/10/16/jb-pritzker-gambling-blackjack-win-las-vegas\"   &gt;more than $1.4 million gambling&lt;/a&gt; that year. The windfall happened in Las Vegas at the blackjack tables, with the winnings donated to charity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker’s office didn't respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a small percentage of Illinois taxpayers do itemize gambling losses, the ramifications on the state’s gaming industry could be severe, warned Ryan Butler, a Florida-based senior news analyst at Covers.com, which provides sports betting information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Casinos and sportsbooks see an outsized proportion of their revenue from a small subset of heavy bettors,” he said. “If these 'whale' players reduce their gambling spend or leave the regulated U.S. market entirely, some projections estimate it could cost the industry billions in annual revenue losses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois gamblers and gaming companies are already subject to some of the highest taxes in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, the General Assembly approved a progressive levy on online sports betting companies, like FanDuel and DraftKings, that tops out at 40% of their local net revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year later, Illinois became the first state to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/casinos-gambling/2025/06/10/sports-betting-tax-illinois-fanduel-draftkings-general-assembly-budget\"   &gt;tax individual wagers&lt;/a&gt; when the General Assembly approved a levy on licensed sportsbooks of 25 cents for each of the first 20 million wagers accepted per year, then 50 cents for every bet beyond that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FanDuel and DraftKings countered by implementing customer surcharges in September 2025 on individual wagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a group of multibillion-dollar sports gambling companies and their lobbying firm in December filed a lawsuit against the city of Chicago aiming to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/12/30/chicago-sports-betting-tax-lawsuit-tro-draftkings-fanduel\"   &gt;block its 10.25% tax&lt;/a&gt; on any revenue collected from bets placed within city limits.&lt;/p&gt;",

The organization, based in Naperville, is a nonprofit serving young people with Down Ayndrome, autism and other special needs, who have “aged out” of services from public schools. It also aims to provide participants with skills to help them find and maintain employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Basically, it's all about activities which promote social interaction and life skills,” Monroy’s son, Clayton McGill, 28, said. McGill has been in the program for a little more than two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-510000\" name=\"image-510000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b08d04a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+167/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe5%2Fcf%2Fa671178a43859bb572677341bcc9%2Fimprovkids-260208-6.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3eb46f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+167/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe5%2Fcf%2Fa671178a43859bb572677341bcc9%2Fimprovkids-260208-6.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5399543/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+167/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe5%2Fcf%2Fa671178a43859bb572677341bcc9%2Fimprovkids-260208-6.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Daniella Caracci from Awesome Life Academy is all smiles as she attends the Monday Morning Improv performance at the Bit Theater in Aurora on Monday, Jan. 26, 2026. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5399543/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+167/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe5%2Fcf%2Fa671178a43859bb572677341bcc9%2Fimprovkids-260208-6.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed77e11/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+167/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe5%2Fcf%2Fa671178a43859bb572677341bcc9%2Fimprovkids-260208-6.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5399543/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+167/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe5%2Fcf%2Fa671178a43859bb572677341bcc9%2Fimprovkids-260208-6.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the show, the improv performers encouraged the Awesome Life participants to shout suggestions for scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Black for the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monroy said their experience, “has been amazing.” In the time McGill has participated, his parents have noticed him building social skills and connecting with friends in spaces where they feel understood and respected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Awesome Life founder Brandon Quaintance said these types of experiences are the driving force behind the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always found that ‘aging out label’ very ironic,” he said. “These are 22-year-olds. They're in the prime time of their life. They're going to have 30-40 more years of quality living. But what's there for them? That's why I primarily focus on this age group.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the show, the improv performers encouraged the Awesome Life participants to shout suggestions for scenes. The youth kept the comedians on their toes with unexpected responses — even for improv — like shouting out “Nashville” as a favorite place in the world to vacation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the Bit Theatre ensemble members on stage, who volunteered their time, have special connections to the community. One of them, comedian Bill Weldon, has a son who has Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has also taught improv classes for young adults with special needs. When he took the stage for this show, he was pleasantly surprised to see a few of his former students in the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They recognized me,” said Weldon. “They were the ones making the suggestions. They booted me off stage, and they had a great time doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-fa0000\" name=\"image-fa0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3e310c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+169/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2Fda%2F2bcdf28a45b493193e23e666aa69%2Fimprovkids-260208-8.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4b9552c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+169/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2Fda%2F2bcdf28a45b493193e23e666aa69%2Fimprovkids-260208-8.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/375083a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+169/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2Fda%2F2bcdf28a45b493193e23e666aa69%2Fimprovkids-260208-8.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Bill Weldon performs as part of the improv cast at the Bit Theater, for a group of individuals with special needs from Awesome Life Academy, in Aurora on Monday, Jan. 26, 2026. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/375083a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+169/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2Fda%2F2bcdf28a45b493193e23e666aa69%2Fimprovkids-260208-8.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6c4f0ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+169/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2Fda%2F2bcdf28a45b493193e23e666aa69%2Fimprovkids-260208-8.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/375083a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+169/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2Fda%2F2bcdf28a45b493193e23e666aa69%2Fimprovkids-260208-8.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comedian Bill Weldon taught improv classes for young adults with special needs.

It was part of a donation spree in which Sacks also gave $400 to many City Council members who went against Mayor Brandon Johnson to pass an alternative city budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business executive known for giving big to former Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s campaigns is gearing up for more. Through a spokesperson, Sacks says “he will continue to proudly support independent&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;CPS Board candidates who make decisions in the best interest of CPS school children and their families.” Sacks is also a major donor to a new super PAC called the Common Ground Collective, which plans to back certain school board candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the SEIU Illinois Council PAC is one of the few other donors that has given to multiple school board members in the past six months. The union’s political action committee, which can contribute more than individuals, gave $10,000 to five of the same incumbents as Sacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Chicago heads into a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/12/08/few-residents-know-chicago-will-have-a-fully-elected-school-board-poll-finds\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;monumental school board election this fall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these early donations may offer a glimpse at some of the race’s potential big players and the issues that motivate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many expect spending on this election cycle to exceed what was spent on Chicago’s first-ever school board race in 2024. That topped $13 million &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chalkbeat.org/chicago/2025/01/27/ctu-incs-spent-millions-on-school-board-races/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;according to an analysis by Chalkbeat Chicago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but involved just 10 seats. Now all 21 seats are up for grabs, and the at-large board president will have to run a citywide campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are gearing up to another eight-figures race,” said Hal Woods, a chief of policy at the parent advocacy organization Kids First Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the only person to announce a run for school board president, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chalkbeat.org/chicago/2025/10/15/sendhil-revuluri-running-for-chicago-school-board-president/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Sendhil Revuluri&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has raised $190,000. The former school board member donated $68,000 to himself, and the rest has come from individuals, including the founder of dating app OKCupid and his wife, Sam and Jessica Yagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the incumbent board members, Carlos Rivas has the most money, with about $40,000. Rivas represents the Southwest Side and was &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/chicago-school-board/2024/10/22/cps-school-board-the-race-in-the-near-northwest-sides-district-3\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;well supported by pro-charter school forces in the last election&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods says he thinks labor-backed and pro-charter school factions will battle like they did in 2024, but some new entities also will play a role, like the Common Ground Collective. The business community has come out strongly against Mayor Johnson and his allies on the school board, painting them as financially irresponsible for wanting to spend, tax and borrow rather than cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Chicago Teachers Union and SEIU-Local 73 may not get behind the same candidates, as they did in the first election. The labor groups that represent the most staff in Chicago Public Schools have had some public conflicts, though SEIU’s president points out they still have a lot of aligned interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Big money lining up for school board race&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2024 school board election, two political committees bolstered by millionaires and billionaires actively contributed. Both the INCS Action Committee, affiliated with the Illinois Network of Charter Schools, and a new entity, The Urban Center, were supportive of charter schools and wanted to limit the power of the Chicago Teachers Union, which opposes the private management of public schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both groups intend to get involved this year, as do two other groups with PACs and super PACs supported by super-wealthy donors. Already, INCS’ super PAC has $3.5 million on hand — more than any other committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these groups may be better prepared this time around. In the 2024 race, the state legislature did not &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2024/03/07/state-lawmakers-approve-elected-school-board-what-comes-next\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;approve a district map until March&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, giving candidates little time to mount a campaign by November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizations now have had more time to find potential candidates, Woods says, and they’re also teaming up. The leaders of INCS and The Urban Center, for example, say they have been identifying potential candidates and are exploring ways to partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Broy, who runs INCS, the advocacy organization for charter schools, says they’ve raised a lot of money because several elections are coming up, including races for Congress and Chicago’s mayor, in addition to the school board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broy says he thinks big-money donors are ready to pony up for the board race for reasons beyond their support for charter schools. INCS’ political action committees favor publicly funded, privately run charters, but are also interested in school accountability and other public education issues, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's a consensus in the city, among many people, that the current trajectory of the board has not been good for students, and so there's interest to change,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-5d0000\" name=\"image-5d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1f600a0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6603x3706+0+349/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2F12%2F00d22fb14297a4bdd80bd0b74b22%2Fcpsrally-092524-01.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a01f55/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6603x3706+0+349/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2F12%2F00d22fb14297a4bdd80bd0b74b22%2Fcpsrally-092524-01.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/206265d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6603x3706+0+349/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2F12%2F00d22fb14297a4bdd80bd0b74b22%2Fcpsrally-092524-01.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A man wearing glasses speaks into a row of microphones surrounded by other people holding umbrellas and the flag of Mexico.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/206265d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6603x3706+0+349/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2F12%2F00d22fb14297a4bdd80bd0b74b22%2Fcpsrally-092524-01.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/74a2753/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6603x3706+0+349/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2F12%2F00d22fb14297a4bdd80bd0b74b22%2Fcpsrally-092524-01.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/206265d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6603x3706+0+349/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2F12%2F00d22fb14297a4bdd80bd0b74b22%2Fcpsrally-092524-01.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juan Rangel, CEO of The Urban Center, spoke in support of CPS CEO Pedro Martinez at a news conference in September 2024.

The school board dramatically ousted Martinez from his position in December 2024 after he pushed back on borrowing to keep the cash-strapped district afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Sacks, the Common Ground Collective said in a statement it will get behind “independent Chicago School board candidates” who support “high-quality education and responsible budgeting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sacks’ spokesperson says the Common Ground Collective is supported by many in the business community, Sacks has donated more than half of the $1 million the organization has raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Future Illinois is also looking to get involved. The group’s chairman is investment banker Steve Koch, who served as deputy mayor under Emanuel. In a text message, the president of One Future Illinois’ PAC, Michael Ruemmler, said the group will be watching the school board races closely and plans to be engaged. As of late December, the PAC had raised $89,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A quality education system is fundamental to having a thriving, growing city and that’s what we are devoted to building,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Labor unions also likely to play prominent role in race&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These big-money committees may hope to find an unexpected ally in the SEIU’s political committee. SEIU is seen as a progressive union that has backed many of the same candidates as the CTU, but they’ve had public fights over who should represent &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2024/12/03/chicago-teachers-union-narrows-contract-demands-in-negotiations-with-cps\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;aides for special education students&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and hourly workers, such as &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/chicago-school-board/2024/10/22/cps-school-board-the-race-in-the-near-northwest-sides-district-3\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;tutors or recess monitors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEIU Local 73 President Dian Palmer says not to make too much of the $10,000 that the union recently gave to five board members who also got donations from Sacks.

For example, the deductions for tips and overtime will likely not apply to households making less than $35,000 a year, and nearly 99% of low-income older adults won't benefit from the federal senior deduction, according to a report from the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are several ways in which these new laws have holes and are not immediately transparent,” said Janet Holtzblatt, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. “I think there will be some surprises for people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Senior deduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump originally pushed for no tax on Social Security benefits, but the compromise was a special deduction for some older taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filers ages 65 and older may qualify for a $6,000 federal deduction, with married couples filing jointly, receiving $12,000. But the amount begins phasing out for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $75,000 if single and $150,000 for married couples filing jointly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deduction is not available for single filers making $175,000 or more and for married couples filing jointly with an income of $250,000 or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center issued a report in August that predicted fewer than half of all adults over 65 will benefit, and the average tax cut for older adults will be $450 — far less than the $6,000 touted by the White House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Auto loan interest&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loans on new vehicles where the final assembly occurred in the U.S. could be eligible for a tax deduction for tax years 2025 through 2028. Used vehicles or those assembled outside the U.S. don't qualify, and neither do leases and cash purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The car must be for personal use, and like other new deductions, it phases out for taxpayers with an income of $100,000 or more, for single filters and at $200,000 for married couples filing jointly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the deduction is new, the IRS has made it easier for lenders by requiring that they only provide the car buyer a statement of interest paid, instead of an official IRS form. However, starting in 2026, lenders will be required to provide a Form 1098 to report interest paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those shopping for new cars, they can confirm the vehicle’s final assembly point on the window sticker or by checking the vehicle identification number. VINs beginning with 1, 4 or 5 are the ones in which final assembly took place in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tax experts said the easiest way to calculate interest on a car loan is to use this formula: principal (the amount you borrowed) x rate (annual rate) x time (length of the loan) = interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No tax on overtime&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers can deduct no more than $12,500 in overtime pay or $25,000 if married. But the deduction only applies to the portion that exceeds their regular pay. So, if a worker gets time-and-a-half while working overtime, they can only deduct the extra “half.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holtzblatt said it's important that, for tax purposes, the hours worked meet the definition of overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which may be different than Illinois law or a union’s definition of overtime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the Fair Labor Standards Act and Illinois law require overtime pay at 1½ times the regular rate for nonexempt employees working over 40 hours a week, but the rules in Illinois are stricter. For example, Illinois generally bans comp time, or private-sector compensatory time off, and ensures that all nonexempt employees get overtime for hours over 40, with specific meal breaks required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tax Policy Center predicts the biggest beneficiaries of the overtime deduction will be those making between $217,000 and $460,000. Those earners would see their taxes reduced by $500 to $600, or about 0.02% of their income after taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wohltman said the overtime deduction is an example of a public relations campaign, rather than something that will have a major impact on taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It sounds good, 'no taxes on overtime,’ but it’s not quite that,\" she said. That's because many were led to believe there would be no tax on all wages earned over 40 hours, rather than no taxes on the \"half\" of the time-and-a-half that is paid for overtime work, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No tax on tips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The no tax on tips deduction has received the most attention, but experts said it’s not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The difficulty, and what may be a surprise to many restaurant workers, is that some income perceived as tips will not be exempt,” Holtzblatt said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said many restaurants, some spurred by an increase in minimum wage laws, are charging diners a service fee that's often considered a tip, but not by the IRS. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Chicago passed an ordinance to increase the city's subminimum wage over five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Generally, when I pay a service fee at a restaurant, in my mind, it’s a substitute for a tip. However, the exemption on tips does not extend to service fees. So, a restaurant worker who is receiving a service fee will not qualify for the tax exemption, while another worker who gets the same amount in tips will,” Holtzblatt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deduction phases out when single filers earn more than $150,000 or $300,000 for married couples filing jointly. However, the average restaurant worker makes far less than $150,000 a year. A One Fair Wage report from March 2024 said tipped workers in Illinois earn a median income of about $14,590 to $16,733 annually, which is below the poverty line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holtzblatt also said many restaurant workers may not qualify because they don't make enough money to have to pay taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This deduction is worthless to people who don’t have income tax liability,” Holtzblatt said. “If you’re a minimum-wage restaurant worker and you already don’t have income tax liability because you’re low-income, and also because of tax credits you may receive for your children, you probably do not have any tax liability, so this deduction will not help you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many seeking the deduction for 2025 tips, it may be a challenge, Wohltman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In 2026, on the W-2, your employer will have to specify the portion that qualifies for the deduction. They don’t have to do that for 2025, so you as the taxpayer will have to have some basis for saying, ‘This is the part of my wages that is the qualifying portion,’” Wohltman said. “There is some guidance that’s out there, but it’s not very helpful for the average taxpayer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While tipped workers may qualify for a certain amount of tipped income on the federal level, those who live in Illinois will not receive any exemption on tips with their state taxes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because Illinois was one of a small number of states that declined to adopt the federal “no tax on tips” provision. This means service workers across the state will continue to pay Illinois income tax on their tip earnings, even as those same tips are exempt from federal taxation.&lt;/p&gt;",

It’s created a “perfect storm,” according to Rebecca Wohltman, tax attorney at Sandberg Phoenix in O'Fallon, Illinois&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting answers and resolution right now is just like pulling teeth,” Wohltman said. “I think a lot of the problem is that a lot of people who opted to retire last year [when DOGE was making cuts] had the experience and knowledge. They knew how to get information and work through the system to get resolution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janet Holtzblatt, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington, D.C., said efforts by the IRS to recruit more employees for this tax season may not provide much help to filers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you hire new people, you need experienced people to train the new hires,” Holtzblatt said. “When you have the departure of the experienced people, you lose the teachers of the new hires.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wohltman, who has been a tax attorney for 11 years, said this year she has reached out to the IRS Taxpayer Advocate Service more than ever in her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That hasn’t helped because they are so overloaded with cases, and they’ve experienced staff cuts as well,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Costabile, certified public accountant and president of Costabile &amp;amp; Steffens in northwest suburban Rolling Meadows, has experienced several delays recently when trying to reach the IRS with questions about a client’s issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s definitely been harder to reach them,” Costabile said. “Not only do you have to wait to get through, but when you do, they can’t help you because their systems go down. It’s happened three times in the last 30 days that I’ve called, and I know my employees are in a similar situation. It’s so frustrating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most experts said simple returns filed electronically shouldn't experience processing delays. But filers who have issues or file by mail may see a delay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are taxpayers who still file their returns on paper, and those take a much longer time to process,” Holtzblatt said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While only about 6% of taxpayers file paper returns, she said the figure is significant enough to create a delay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s still several million people,” Holtzblatt said. She said some file paper returns because they're \"late adapters of technology,\" concerned about online security, or they don't have access to a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holtzblatt also said she anticipates the IRS will take longer to process the returns of anyone who gets flagged because of questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, the IRS may ask a taxpayer for more information about a child who they are claiming as a dependent. The taxpayer then provides it, but it takes more time because a human has to review it, and if they have less employees, it will take more time,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another change this year that can potentially cause delays is the requirement of a new federal tax form called Schedule 1-A, which must be completed when filing 2025 federal income tax returns to claim the new deductions from President Donald Trump's budget bill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most experts advise filing electronically as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Make sure your returns are accurate, because if there’s an error and you have to correct it, you’re going to be waiting a long time,” Wohltman said. “And if you’re in a situation where you’re dealing with a problem like a correction or a notice the IRS sent you, you have to be patient. There is no way to expedite the process.”&lt;/p&gt;",

On most days, Matthew and Eleanor would spend hours in the basement noodling with instruments after singing with their grandmother Olga at the nearby Assumption Greek Orthodox Church in Austin, all of it eventually marinating in the duo’s experimental rock soup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-840000\" name=\"module-840000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Fiery Furnaces&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;When:&lt;/b&gt; 7 p.m. Feb. 22&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt; Old Town School of Folk Music, 4544 N.

After an incredibly prolific period that resulted in eight albums in seven years, including their 2003 garage rock debut “Gallowsbird’s Bark” and 2004’s conceptual opus “Blueberry Boat,” a hiatus came in 2011 to allow Matthew and Eleanor to pursue individual creative paths and solo careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s been some blips since, like a performance at the 2021 edition of Pitchfork Music Festival and, a year later, working with Jack White’s Third Man Records to release new music in a decade, the characteristically whimsical singles “Down At the So and So on Somewhere\" and “The Fortune Teller’s Revenge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are signs of life that the duo is really warming up again. In addition to the slate of new shows, the pair just re-released “Blueberry Boat” in 2025 for its 20th anniversary and there’s a new limited cassette re-release for 2006’s “Bitter Tea” that will be available exclusively at the upcoming concerts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to work,” Eleanor explained of the reunion. “We want to keep doing something that we've been really lucky to do in the past.

All of it is very intentional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We played some shows like this back in 2011 … and those were kind of the last shows that we did as a band. So it feels like a good place to start again and reevaluate,” said Eleanor. “It’s kind of nice to present them in the barest way possible before we start doing something else.” She hinted that new recordings are planned for the near future, which will be featured on the duo’s Bandcamp page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We get to fulfill or slightly surprise the expectations coming back into it, even for ourselves,” added Matt of digging out the older material. “Playing ‘Blueberry Boat,’ I liked it much better than I thought. And I was much less embarrassed by the lyrics than I thought I would be,” he joked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, that’s long been the running theme for The Fiery Furnaces who often elicited scratched heads for their non-linear orchestrations and wacky lyrics on avant-garde songs like “Nevers” or for making a full album with their grandma Olga narrating her life’s stories (2005’s “Rehearsing My Choir”). “People would say we’re so weird and awful, and other people said they make good music, but of course, we were always running up against people's expectations and we weren't always delivering on those,” said Matt, joking, “And they got especially annoyed at having to hear us when they file shared or downloaded our record for free.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleanor hopes that the reception might change given some distance and the fact that music makers now are heralded for what The Fiery Furnaces did all along — being experimental and coloring outside the lines. Even the Talkhouse Podcast just released a new episode titled, “Apologizing to The Fiery Furnaces,” hinting that critics may be coming around to the fact that they were wrong all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems like people do have a larger capacity for all different kinds of sounds now, but whether they will be able to grasp on to those things, I don't know,” she wondered. “It would be great to put out new music and then have people rediscover what we did in the past. That’s the goal. Do we stand a chance with 100 times more competition than we had 20 years ago? I don't know, but it’s going to be fun to try.”&lt;/p&gt;",

The protocol was developed in collaboration with Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and the Illinois State’s Attorneys Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Law enforcement officers are entrusted with extraordinary authority to serve the public and keep our communities safe,” Raoul said in a statement. “When that authority is abused or escalates into unlawful violence, prosecutors must take action if the burden of proof can be met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am proud to stand with State’s Attorney Burke and fellow prosecutors committed to using every lawful tool available to hold this administration accountable consistent with this protocol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayor Johnson previously signed an executive order last month &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/01/31/brandon-johnson-investigate-ice-prosecution-executive-order-chicago\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;instructing Chicago police to investigate alleged misconduct&lt;/a&gt; by the feds and make referrals to the state’s attorney “at the direction of the Mayor’s Office.” The state’s attorney’s office called the order “wholly inappropriate,” saying it &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/06/eileen-oneill-burke-brandon-johnson-immigration-ice-law\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;raises issues of political interference&lt;/a&gt; that could jeopardize criminal cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the plan outlined by O’Neill Burke, law enforcement agencies will lead criminal investigations by collecting and preserving evidence. If law enforcement needs assistance getting sworn testimony or additional evidence that's not volunteered, the state’s attorney’s office can step in and impanel a grand jury. Prosecutors will conduct an independent review of all evidence and make charging decisions, as they do in all felony cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in these cases, O’Neill Burke’s office will also have to consider the specific protections offered to on-duty federal agents — demonstrating the officer does not have Supremacy Clause immunity. That protects federal officers from state prosecution while acting in their official capacity, as long as they “did no more than what was necessary and proper for him to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past six months, federal agents have torn through cities across the country, carrying out Trump’s audacious immigration enforcement blitz. Agents have unleashed unprecedented levels of force, deploying tear gas, pepper balls and fatally shooting people in both Minneapolis and Chicago in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But so far, no federal agents have been charged with committing a crime while on the job. Officials in Minneapolis have launched an investigation into the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti. But they have yet to file any charges and are running into roadblocks while trying to obtain evidence from the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Chicago area, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer has been &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/01/30/new-body-camera-footage-shows-aftermath-of-ice-officer-allegedly-attacking-activist-near-chicago\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;charged with attacking a protester&lt;/a&gt; while off-duty in Brookfield.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/public-safety/2026/02/06/how-can-chicagos-top-prosecutor-hold-ice-accountable\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;How can Chicago’s top prosecutor hold ICE accountable?&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/01/31/brandon-johnson-investigate-ice-prosecution-executive-order-chicago\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Mayor Brandon Johnson orders CPD to investigate federal immigration agents for potential prosecution&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/06/eileen-oneill-burke-brandon-johnson-immigration-ice-law\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;County’s top prosecutor calls Mayor Brandon Johnson’s ICE executive order ‘wholly inappropriate’&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

But the arrest of a brother of a monarch was an extraordinary development with no precedent in modern times that will no doubt put more pressure on the crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the arrest, King Charles III said that the law must take its course in the investigation, and he sought to distance the royal family from &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/photo-gallery/britain-epstein-andrew-former-prince-arrested-1eabcfff09626fbed29a5920ffe506f9\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Mountbatten-Windsor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thames Valley Police said that a man in his 60s from Norfolk in eastern England &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/britain-epstein-andrew-former-prince-arrested-582dfea743b6174d2dfe56466d2f4981\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;was arrested&lt;/a&gt; and remained in custody. The force, which covers areas west of London, including Mountbatten-Windsor’s former home, did not identify the suspect, in line with standard procedures in Britain, but pointed to its statement when asked to confirm if Andrew was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jeffrey-epstein-andrew-prince-mountbatten-windsor-friend-7fa8aadad792e66963a1d18d9039235b\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Mountbatten-Windsor&lt;/a&gt;, who turned 66 on Thursday, moved to his brother King Charles III’s estate in Norfolk after he was evicted from his longtime home near Windsor Castle earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Police are looking at whether Andrew sent confidential reports to Epstein&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thames Valley Police previously said it was “assessing” reports that Mountbatten-Windsor sent confidential trade reports to Epstein in 2010, when the former prince was Britain’s special envoy for international trade. Those reports stemmed from correspondence between the two men that was among the millions of pages of documents from the U.S. Justice Department’s investigation into Epstein that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/epstein-files-justice-department-trump-ed743598c320b94bd9d91631618678d9\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;were released last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,’’ Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement. “We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police also said they were searching two properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrest came after pictures circulated online that appeared to show unmarked police cars at Wood Farm, Mountbatten-Windsor’s home on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, with plainclothes officers gathering outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the most spectacular fall from grace for a member of the royal family in modern times,” said Craig Prescott, a royal expert at Royal Holloway, University of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policing commentator Danny Shaw told the BBC that in most cases, suspects are held between 12 and 24 hours and are then either charged or released pending further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absolute longest the former prince can be held for is 96 hours — but this would require multiple extensions from senior police officers and a Magistrate’s Court. It is unclear what time Andrew was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew will be placed in “a cell in a custody suite” with just “a bed and a toilet,” where he will wait until his police interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’ll be no special treatment for him,'' Shaw said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Andrew’s Epstein connections have long dogged the royal family&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The late Queen Elizabeth II forced her second son to give up royal duties and end his charitable work in 2019 after he tried to explain away his ties to Epstein during a catastrophic interview with the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more details about the relationship emerged in a book published last year, and Charles stripped him of the right to be called a prince and ordered him to move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/britain-epstein-andrew-royals-william-0d3b16798b32ebd1d98b72d209769105\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;unprecedented announcement&lt;/a&gt; last week that Buckingham Palace was ready to cooperate in the event of a police inquiry into Mountbatten-Windsor’s links to Epstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jeffrey-epstein-andrew-prince-mountbatten-windsor-friend-7fa8aadad792e66963a1d18d9039235b\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;was forced to act&lt;/a&gt; after the U.S. Justice Department released millions of pages of Epstein documents that revealed the extent of his relationship with Mountbatten-Windsor and showed that their correspondence continued long after Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Thursday’s arrest, Charles issued a statement to reiterate that he would cooperate with the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,’’ the king said in a statement signed Charles R. “As this process continues, it would not be right for me to comment further on this matter.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: “My family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epstein was &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/bb41822a39a147ccb03501acf049b58c\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;arrested on sex trafficking charges&lt;/a&gt; brought by federal prosecutors in New York in 2019.

In that incident, a fleeing Jeep hit a train crossing at 89th Street, flew into the air and crashed into six cars. Baker then chased the driver on foot and fired the Taser.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;At issue&lt;/b&gt;: The crash, Baker’s accidental firing of the Taser and his failure to report the chase raise new questions about why, in early 2025, Baker was&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrduiy-l-k/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;allowed to join a tactical team&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the Gresham District on the South Side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key context&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Chief of Patrol Jon Hein rejected Baker’s first application to the team in spring 2024, citing a poor disciplinary record. The car crash happened seven weeks later. In January 2025, Baker applied a second time, again after Gresham District Cmdr. Michel Tate recommended him. This time, Hein approved, even though police brass knew about additional infractions.&amp;nbsp;In June 2025, three months after joining the tactical team, Baker&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrduiy-l-u/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;shot and killed his partner&lt;/a&gt;, Officer Krystal Rivera, as they chased a man into a building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrduiy-l-o/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;SPRINGFIELD ✶&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-cc0000\" name=\"image-cc0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6f85850/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+490/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3d%2Ffc%2F304c255b4274a26639339fd16189%2Fsosbudget0218.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f195b33/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+490/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3d%2Ffc%2F304c255b4274a26639339fd16189%2Fsosbudget0218.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cebc35a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+490/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3d%2Ffc%2F304c255b4274a26639339fd16189%2Fsosbudget0218.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Gov.

JB Pritzker made the case for his $56 billion state budget proposal, which leans on a new tax on big social media companies to help weather gloomy economic straits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;His agenda&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Pritzker outlined other highlights of his spring legislative agenda, including a push to cut red tape on local zoning laws to allow for more duplexes and granny flats to increase housing supply and lower prices. He’ll also advocate for a ban on cellphones for students in schools, more social media privacy protections for children, a two-year pause on new data center tax credits, and a crackdown on junk fees on tickets and other online purchases added at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key context&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Pritzker’s budget address didn’t approach the fiery oratory he unleashed last year when he likened the second Trump administration to the early days of Nazi Germany. Nor is he rocking the boat much with the eighth spending proposal of his tenure, a mostly status quo budget that allows Illinois Democrats to highlight cost-of-living concerns in a midterm election year as Pritzker seeks a rare third term and mulls a 2028 presidential run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrduiy-l-x/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;CITY COUNCIL RECAP 🏛️&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-b50000\" name=\"image-b50000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aba5a22/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2Fff%2F12be51f04676ac5afdfaf0fba3e4%2Fcitycouncil-260219-01a.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2eb6a0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2Fff%2F12be51f04676ac5afdfaf0fba3e4%2Fcitycouncil-260219-01a.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5774964/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2Fff%2F12be51f04676ac5afdfaf0fba3e4%2Fcitycouncil-260219-01a.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mayor Brandon Johnson presides over a City Council meeting at City Hall Wednesday. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5774964/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2Fff%2F12be51f04676ac5afdfaf0fba3e4%2Fcitycouncil-260219-01a.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/60115b2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2Fff%2F12be51f04676ac5afdfaf0fba3e4%2Fcitycouncil-260219-01a.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5774964/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2Fff%2F12be51f04676ac5afdfaf0fba3e4%2Fcitycouncil-260219-01a.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayor Brandon Johnson presides over a City Council meeting Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrduiy-l-m/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;At City Council, Mayor Johnson pays tribute to Jesse Jackson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Reporting by &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrduiy-l-c/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Fran Spielman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tribute to Rev.&lt;/b&gt;: During Wednesday's City Council meeting,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrduiy-l-q/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Mayor Brandon Johnson said&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;\"power exists in all of us\" to honor Rev.

plan.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi arrived from New York’s Prospect Park Zoo nearly a month ago and had been in quarantine until Friday, when he was placed in his permanent habitat at Lincoln Park Zoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since his arrival, Qi has made himself right at home, said Cassy Kutilek, curator of large mammals and carnivores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qi, who was brought to Lincoln Park Zoo on a breeding recommendation, will be a new mate for Nisha, an 8-year-old female red panda who has been there several years. Kutilek says the arrival is perfectly timed, as red pandas typically breed between January and March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the pair met for the first time, and Kutilek says they seem to be compatible based on their genetics and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"So far, it’s been a love connection,\" Kutilek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjrduiy-l-ij/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading the Sun-Times&amp;nbsp;Morning Edition!&lt;br&gt;Got a story you think we missed?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:newsletters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Email us here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written and curated by&lt;/b&gt;: Matt Moore&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor&lt;/b&gt;: Eydie Cubarrubia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Chicago Sun-Times is a nonprofit supported by&amp;nbsp;readers like you.

He had many good ideas. Marrying my mom, for starters. He also held patents in the design of compact nuclear reactors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, those two good ideas might be related — there was a shakedown cruise of an atomic-powered submarine that my father, a naval reservist, was keen to avoid. Married men were exempt. Perhaps it's cynical of me to connect them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he also had one really good idea that resonated around the world and has an impact today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-860000\" name=\"module-860000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Opinion bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;My father's really good idea occurred to him in the early 1970s. The 747 Jumbo Jet had been introduced, to endless publicity — the spiral staircase leading to the lounge in the bulging upper deck hump, the enormous capacity, 400 passengers, making long haul air travel economical for millions. And — what my father noticed — radar systems and other instruments that monitored atmospheric conditions around the plane. A constant stream of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;You know&lt;/i&gt; ... Robert Steinberg thought ...&lt;i&gt;what if that weather data wasn't just used to fly the plane? What if it was sent to a central location? And then used ... to predict the weather?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be a big improvement over weather stations — scattered mountaintop outposts, with thermometers and spinning anemometers and such. Plus weather balloons, instrument packages floated high into the upper atmosphere for expensive keyhole glimpses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote an article titled, \"Role of Commercial Aircraft in Global Monitoring Systems,\" that ran in the April 27, 1973 issue of &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The new family of wide-bodied jets such as the 747, DC-10, and L-1011 aircraft can be used to supply important global atmospheric and tropical meteorological data for which there is a pressing need,\" my father wrote. \"In the final analysis, commercial aircraft may offer the most inexpensive way to monitor our atmosphere in the near future.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By summer, NASA loaned him out to NCAR — the National Center for Atmospheric Research — in Boulder, Colorado. NCAR was in a stunning, I.M. Pei-designed building of reddish concrete. Boulder was nice. Mountains. He traveled the world, signing up airlines. The idea took hold. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Aircraft-based observations play a big role in the accuracy of weather forecasts — reducing forecast errors in numerical weather prediction systems by up to 10%\" according to the World Meterological Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a long way of saying that, in an era of constant shocks to American science — 25,000 federal researchers and support staff left the government this past year, thousands of grants slashed, agencies shuttered, scientific data yanked off line, the U.S. scientific establishment being \"systematically destroyed\" in the words of the Union of Concerned Scientists, NCAR being scuttled stood out as personal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And political. NCAR is being closed down by the Trump administration for the sin of \"climate alarmism.\" Because atmospheric research points to uncomfortable facts that business and its handmaiden, government, don't want to think about anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should be clear why all of this is happening. Business makes money, but if it has to, oh, consider pollution, or worry about the purity of food or the efficacy of drugs, it makes less money. So watchdog agencies, and research facilities and university centers that would counterbalance the whims of business are being scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists are not going quietly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Our group in Chicago has grown, hosting teach-ins, talks at public libraries, and community events around the city,\" said Anna Vlasits, a University of Illinois Chicago neurobiologist who last year helped organize the city's &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2025/03/02/donald-trump-federal-funding-freeze-science-researchers-national-institutes-of-health\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“Stand Up for Science”&lt;/a&gt; rally on Federal Plaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Science is important.\" she said. \"It brings us knowledge. We need government to be involved, to support scientific research and training in this country.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How has the past year been?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It feels a little bit like playing Whac-a-Mole — so much is going on that's not good,\" she said. \"Young scientists being turned away from the United States is profoundly bad and alarming. The U.S. is a powerhouse training scientists, globally, and now we're losing people who are concerned about being an immigrant, or worried about whether their work will be funded.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2025/03/02/donald-trump-federal-funding-freeze-science-researchers-national-institutes-of-health\"   &gt;Chicago scientists reel from Trump funding cuts: ‘We are just going to abandon all those discoveries’&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I wondered whether she knew about NCAR, or whether it was a private heartbreak. She did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The supercomputer at NCAR being privatized,\" said Vlasits. \"They're generally taking the whole center apart. A lot of climate data is now owned by companies, so they can take advantage of knowing what's happening with global climate in a way individuals can't.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next \"Stand Up for Science\" rally will be Saturday, March 7 at 1 p.m. on Federal Plaza. I was at last year's rally, a cold, blustery, wet day, and hoped the weather wouldn't be as bad this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I hope not,\" she said. \"It's hard to say. Maybe we won't know if we're not monitoring the weather anymore.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

Jesse Jackson lit a spark with a call to protest the 1996 ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That year, just one Black person, short film director Dianne Houston, was included among 166 nominees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going to open up the consciousness of Hollywood,” &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1996-03-22-me-50083-story.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;said Jackson&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/17/what-we-know-rev-jesse-jacksons-death-services\"   &gt;died at 84 on Tuesday.&lt;/a&gt; The Chicago civil rights leader called for attendees to wear a symbol against “race exclusion and cultural violence” in Hollywood, and others to picket outside of ABC-TV affiliates in Chicago and other cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the protest faltered, and Jackson was criticized by the academy, viewers and other industry insiders, including Black actors who attended the event. But the civil rights leader’s critiques proved prescient amid the public outcry over the 2015 and 2016 ceremonies, which did not recognize any actors of color in the acting categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-110000\" name=\"image-110000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/66147c6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3077x1727+0+236/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2Fa2%2Fb4b9b4bc4cb498db8ba115b57a10%2Fap369063958682.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/68aa3ca/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3077x1727+0+236/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2Fa2%2Fb4b9b4bc4cb498db8ba115b57a10%2Fap369063958682.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4feec63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3077x1727+0+236/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2Fa2%2Fb4b9b4bc4cb498db8ba115b57a10%2Fap369063958682.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Jesse Jackson, Betty Shabazz, Tom Todd, Aretha Franklin, Louis Stokes\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4feec63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3077x1727+0+236/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2Fa2%2Fb4b9b4bc4cb498db8ba115b57a10%2Fap369063958682.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/28a470d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3077x1727+0+236/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2Fa2%2Fb4b9b4bc4cb498db8ba115b57a10%2Fap369063958682.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4feec63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3077x1727+0+236/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2Fa2%2Fb4b9b4bc4cb498db8ba115b57a10%2Fap369063958682.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev.

Later, he struggled to generate support at the 1996 Oscars in part because the ceremony featured two prominent Black participants that people wanted to support: producer Quincy Jones and host Whoopi Goldberg, who poked fun at Jackson from the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Jackson should be credited with sounding the alarm about marginalization in the industry, said Michael NJ Wright, a filmmaker and adjunct professor of instruction at Columbia College Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was this attitude that Black people made Black movies, women made women's movies, and white men made everything,” Wright said. “It was just an understanding of the way the movie business functioned.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-da0000\" name=\"image-da0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/87b7108/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2995x1681+90+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fd0%2Fb0958ed5470dace71b0f912172b3%2Fmnjw-op-push-w-rev-jackson-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b61b14f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2995x1681+90+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fd0%2Fb0958ed5470dace71b0f912172b3%2Fmnjw-op-push-w-rev-jackson-2.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7b04f5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2995x1681+90+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fd0%2Fb0958ed5470dace71b0f912172b3%2Fmnjw-op-push-w-rev-jackson-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"MNJW@ Op.

Hosted at the International Amphitheater by his Operation PUSH organization, the five-day business, arts and culture event drew more than a million attendees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Temptations and the Jackson Five to Nancy Wilson and the Staple Singers, Jackson helped recruit a wealth of Black talent to perform. The event was documented by director Stan Lathan in a film, \"&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2024/10/18/save-the-children-chicago-jesse-jackson-stan-lathan-1972-black-expo-sammy-davis-jr\"   &gt;Save the Children&lt;/a&gt;.\" A digitally restored version is streaming on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"They had Black cameramen at a time when it was very difficult for Black people to get into the unions,\" Stewart said. \"[Jackson] was so committed to Black agency and autonomy and self-determination, and he brought that into every interaction that he had with film and film-making.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That influence has carried on in Black filmmakers like Chicago native &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2025/12/02/robert-townsend-chicago-film-festival-columbia-college-cultural-center\"   &gt;Robert Townsend&lt;/a&gt;, who famously directed, produced and financed his debut film, \"Hollywood Shuffle.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My heart hurts today with the passing of the civil rights legend Rev. Jesse Jackson,\" Townsend told the Sun-Times in a statement. \"As the pendulum swings backwards in these trying times, he is a constant reminder of the movement he helped start and put his life on the line for. May God bless his soul. I pray for his family at this time and lift them up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson's life is also a reminder that justice is not always immediate, Wright said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He chipped away at many of these institutions that were impediments, and then we get progress,\" he said. \"Maybe not the generation that we lived, but future generations enjoy it.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

Hammond's ready to partner with the Chicago Bears — basically, Hammond will do whatever it takes to help make this project a success.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huston read a statement from the Bears, asserting the Indiana bill’s passage “would mark the most meaningful step forward in our stadium planning efforts to date. We are committed to finishing the remaining site-specific necessary due diligence to support our vision to build a world-class stadium near the Wolf Lake area in Hammond, Indiana.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Bears spokesman said “Hammond is the site we are focused on. Work to be done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That wouldn’t appear to rule out the team’s long-coveted move to Arlington Heights, one of three places the team has pointed its focus to over the past few years, along with Chicago and Hammond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complaining of a lack of legislative partnership in their current home state, the Bears announced in December they were looking at Indiana as a potential destination, visiting several spots with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The movement &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears-stadium/2026/01/16/chicago-bears-stadium-northwest-indiana-arlington-heights-jb-pritzker-kam-buckner\"   &gt;appeared to spur some action in Springfield&lt;/a&gt;, where the team is seeking legislation that would allow them to negotiate payments with local taxing bodies in lieu of paying full property taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Illinois House panel had been set for a hearing on such legislation Thursday, but the committee canceled the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gov. JB Pritzker, who has supported the prospect of publicly funding infrastructure projects to support a stadium, has expressed optimism in ongoing negotiations with the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that progress has been made,” he said Wednesday, after delivering his annual State of the State address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other sources close to the Arlington Heights negotiations were also optimistic about the direction of talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Pritzker spokesperson on Thursday said \"Illinois was ready to move this bill forward. After a productive three hour meeting yesterday, the Bears leaders requested the ILGA pause the hearing to make further tweaks to the bill. This morning, we were surprised to see a statement lauding Indiana and ignoring Illinois.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Indiana bill would empower a newly created Northwest Indiana Stadium Authority to build a stadium for the Bears and sell it to the team for $1 once the 40-year bonds are paid off. The Bears would also have the option to buy the Indiana stadium sooner by retiring the outstanding debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the Bears would sign a 35-year lease that would allow the team to retain all revenues generated by the stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoosier lawmakers are aiming to pass it by the end of the month. Illinois lawmakers are in session through May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indiana Gov. Mike Braun trumpeted his state’s progress with the team, saying their legislation “puts forward the essential framework to complete this agreement, contingent upon site due diligence proceeding smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The State of Indiana moves at the speed of business, and we’ve demonstrated that through our quick coordination between state agencies, local government, and the legislature to set the stage for a huge win for all Hoosiers,” Braun said in a social media post. “We have built a strong relationship with the Bears organization that will serve as the foundation for a public-private partnership, leading to the construction of a world-class stadium and a win for taxpayers.”&lt;/p&gt;",

Vienen con respeto y vienen a decir gracias\", dijo Jesse Jackson Jr. durante un evento mediático frente a la casa de la familia Jackson. \"Pero en estos servicios de despedida todos son bienvenidos: demócratas, republicanos, liberales y conservadores, de la derecha y de la izquierda, porque su vida es lo suficientemente amplia como para abarcar todo el espectro de lo que significa ser estadounidense\".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considerado como el protegido del Reverendo Martin Luther King Jr., Jackson trabajó incansablemente durante el Movimiento por los Derechos Civiles y después para abogar por los derechos de las personas negras. Fundó la Coalición Rainbow PUSH, la famosa organización sin fines de lucro multirracial con sede en Chicago, en 1970, y continúa luchando por el cambio social, la igualdad económica y los derechos civiles. En la década de 1980, Jackson dirigió la primera campaña presidencial viable de un candidato negro en Estados Unidos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tras su muerte, líderes de todo el mundo y residentes de Chicago han compartido mensajes de apoyo para la familia, recordando a Jackson por sus años de activismo mientras lloran su pérdida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;¿Cómo murió?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aunque la familia no ha dado una causa oficial de muerte ni ha dicho dónde falleció, Jackson había estado en declive de salud durante una década antes de su muerte.

Nos apoyamos en sus hombros. Enviamos nuestras más profundas condolencias a la familia Jackson y a todos en Chicago y más allá que lo conocieron y lo amaron\".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El presidente Donald Trump también extendió sus condolencias a la familia de Jackson en un comunicado publicado en Truth Social el martes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Lo conocí bien, mucho antes de ser presidente\", dijo. \"Era muy extrovertido, ¡una persona que realmente amaba a la gente! A pesar de que me llaman falsamente y de manera consistente racista por los sinvergüenzas y lunáticos de la izquierda radical, TODOS demócratas, siempre fue un placer ayudar a Jesse en su camino\".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Líderes de Chicago, incluyendo al alcalde Brandon Johnson y al gobernador JB Pritzker, también compartieron sus condolencias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"En honor al servicio del Rev.

He was covering the Chicago music scene heavily for several outlets. But two of his buddies offered a suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They told Silverstein that he should write about sports. They acknowledged his writing chops but said he reached another level when he wrote about sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought sports was too easy,” Silverstein said this week. “Maybe in a sense I was looking down on it. It came so naturally to me that I thought nothing this easy can be worthwhile. What I found was, I was terribly wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silverstein loved sports, especially Chicago sports. He grew up on the North Shore in the 1980s, when the Bears and Bulls were rising to power and the Cubs were returning to relevance. Sportswriting might have come easy for him, but there was a way to make it challenging and make his work stand out — become Chicago’s sports historian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s a self-applied title,” Silverstein said. “My father always said, ‘Let them put you in a box,’ meaning help people know who you are. I love history, I love sports. I thought that was good branding. I thought ‘Chicago sports historian’ was crisp and gave me something it live up to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which he has. Silverstein, 44, has broken news retroactively. In 2019, when the Bears had Kyle Fuller and Tarik Cohen model 1936 throwback uniforms, Silverstein discovered they were the first Black players to wear them because the NFL had banned Black players from 1934 to ’45. His research drew not just the Bears’ attention, but the late Jesse Jackson’s, and the story was picked up by ESPN, Fox and even the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Silverstein led the Bears to correct their record book, making “Chuckin’ ” Charlie O’Rourke the then-record holder for touchdown passes by a rookie with 11 in 1942. When Caleb Williams broke it with 20 in 2024, O’Rourke received his long-overdue recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silverstein has appeared on Chicago radio, TV and podcasts. His work appears on the website Windy City Gridiron and his own site, A Shot On Ehlo, named in honor of Michael Jordan’s buzzer-beating, playoff-series-winning shot over the Cavaliers’ Craig Ehlo in 1989. Late Bulls radio voice Jim Durham said the words “a shot on Ehlo” on his call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silverstein’s Bulls research has led to his 2016 e-book “How the GOAT Was Built: 6 Life Lessons From the 1996 Chicago Bulls,” and the series of posts on his website are leading to his book, “6 Rings: The Bulls, The City, and the Dynasty that Changed the Game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[‘How the GOAT Was Built’] was really important because it formalized my position as a sports historian,” Silverstein said, “and it gave me something I could do shows on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this work isn’t even Silverstein’s job. By day, he’s the director of content at WTWH Media, where he covers the business of senior living. By night, he’s researching and writing about sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just write a lot. I have a gear,” said Silverstein, who’s married with two kids. “There’s no good way to explain it. I have a gear that just goes. If I didn’t get these stories out, I would break down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Sun-Times columnist Rick Telander noticed that gear early. As a sophomore at New Trier, Silverstein hosted a radio show and asked Telander to be a guest. Telander appeared and then invited Silverstein to sit in on a recording of the beloved show “The Sportswriters on TV.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He had this enthusiasm that kind of cracked me up,” Telander said. “He knew all kinds of stuff about Chicago sports. He was deadly serious about this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I realized he had some writing skills. He had a book on Obama, I remember reading that. The enthusiasm affected me. There was a whole lot of optimism. And then he turned that same enthusiasm into writing about sports.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That enthusiasm runs through his most recent book, “Why We Root: The Mad Obsessions of a Chicago Sports Fan.” It’s 500 pages of Silverstein’s work as he rides a roller coaster of emotions that began in childhood. He explored not just big events, but their place in our shared culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His current research project is on Paul Patterson, the Bears’ first full-time Black employee. Silverstein said the Bears hired Patterson in 1967 but he wasn’t in the team’s media guide until 1969. He held titles of “player relations” and “traveling secretary” before being lost to history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love to write, love to research, love to learn and love to figure out a way to tell stories that don’t exist,” Silverstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Telander: “He found something no one’s doing. Doing research, journalism work, interviewing people, being persistent. Other people don’t want to do the work.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

A gust of wind had just knocked the baby's stroller into the lake around 3 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, in the 3200 block of North DuSable Lake Shore Drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I just realized that the lady wasn't able to help because she was in too much panic, which is understandable. So I'm like, 'I guess I'm going in,' and I just jumped,\" Cundiff said. \"I had no idea what the plan was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There were a few times where I didn't know if I was gonna stay up long enough,\" he added.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luis Kapost, who lives near the harbor, also jumped into action after seeing what happened. As Cundiff treaded water, Kapost tossed one end of his Chicago Cubs jacket over to him, buying them both time to figure out what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I'm holding one sleeve, he's holding the other, and at least they're not floating away,\" Kapost, 43, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Him throwing that jacket down helped me so much,\" Cundiff said. \"I did not know how long I was gonna be able to keep either of us afloat.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other passersby who saw the situation called 911 and found a life ring to toss to Cundiff. Kapost and the baby girl's mother helped pull him and the child to safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It took forever,\" Kapost said. \"It probably happened in the span of five minutes.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cundiff, the mother and the child were all hospitalized afterward, officials said. The child was in good condition, according to Chicago police. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother of the child could not be reached directly for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cundiff was still at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center for testing Thursday afternoon. He said doctors were \"worried about his elevated heart enzymes\" and kept him overnight for testing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If all the results turn out OK, and they're not seeing anything, I should be able to leave today,\" Cundiff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Kapost and Cundiff called what happened a \"freak accident\" and said the mother of the child is not at fault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I hope the mom has grace with herself and doesn't beat herself up too much about it,\" Cundiff said. \"It's not like she wasn't with the baby. ... It's not her fault, and I really hope she knows that.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapost said a blend of his ability to \"slow down and think everything through\" and Cundiff's impulsively heroic actions made it possible to pull the child out of the water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapost — who is a pilot for American Airlines — noted his training prepared him for a situation like this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"In my line of work, we're taught when you rush, that's when you tend to make mistakes that can eventually lead to disaster,\" Kapost said. \"So that was kind of my focus. Be methodical, take your time, think everything through. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If it comes to it, we'll get more people,\" he added. \"It's a small baby. I think everyone in the city would've jumped into the lake if it took us all jumping in there to get her out.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kapost applauded Cundiff's actions and hoped he'd get recognized for his efforts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"That's the epitome of a hero, someone who's going to act, to help somebody else they don't know even though they're placing their own life in danger,\" Kapost said. \"He's an absolute rock star.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cundiff said he felt \"weird\" about being labeled a hero and he was \"just a server and standup comedian in the right place at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Turns out if I have to choose fight or flight, I guess I'm a fighter,\" Cundiff said. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;",

The new franchise will begin play in 2006 and will be the league's 14th team. The league is still losing money after almost a decade in business, and relies heavily upon the NBA's support. It hasn't broken out of niche status in most markets, and five franchises have either folded or moved. Yet nine years after it tipped off, the WNBA is still going, its mere existence a sign of its strength.*(AP Photo/Nam Y.

In Chicago, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Sky&lt;/a&gt; principal owner Michael Alter is &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2026/02/01/sky-principal-owner-michael-alter-sued-by-early-minority-investor-over-ownership-stake\"   &gt;being sued by a minority investor&lt;/a&gt; who alleges his stake was unfairly diluted just as the franchise’s value popped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the disputes reflect a new era for the Sky and the league, one where millions of dollars are at stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a big change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much of the Sky’s history, ownership meant absorbing losses in service of a social mission, not capturing meaningful upside. As recently as 2023, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2026/02/18/court-seals-complaint-against-sky-owner-michael-alter-debt-conversion-at-center-of-lawsuit\"   &gt;the Sky had trouble raising money at an $85 million valuation&lt;/a&gt;. Now, one investor estimates the franchise is worth closer to $350 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s all of a sudden real money for people,” that investor told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what happens when a small community built on belief becomes a booming business?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sun-Times spoke with early investors, fans and players to understand how the meaning of the Sky is changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What role should the team's purpose-driven investors play now?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Linda Friedman understood that the Sky would be different from an NBA or NFL franchise. Instead of being funded by a single billionaire, it would be backed by a group of mission-driven owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alter pitched the investment to her in feminist terms. He asked her to imagine young boys attending games in jerseys bearing women’s names, and how that might shape their understanding of the value women bring to a team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It resonated with Friedman, a lawyer whose life’s work, she says, has been “fighting Wall Street on gender and race.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mission would be to help create opportunities for players, coaches and fans who otherwise might not have them. Over two decades, she tried to do her part. She bought blocks of tickets and gave them away. She provided pro bono work for the team’s charitable arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Alter absorbed the financial losses. Friedman estimates he loaned the team roughly $30 million over the years to keep the team afloat, and has never gotten proper recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the lawsuit against him bothers her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What kills me about that lawsuit is that instead of saying thank you for hanging in there because now I have something of tremendous value, it’s just all the criticism,” Friedman told the Sun-Times. “It’s not about truth. It’s about money.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-400000\" name=\"html-embed-module-400000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-scatter\" data-src=\"visualisation/27683354\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27683354/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"scatter visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman said she never expected a financial return from the Sky. The return, for her, was walking into a Sky game and seeing a different crowd than at Wrigley Field or Soldier Field. Not just “privileged kids from the suburbs,” but families and young fans who otherwise might not have experienced professional sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now she wonders whether that original mission can survive the league’s financial ascent, or whether Wintrust Arena could start to resemble those other venues in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A good part of me would like to have my money back to invest in a similar cause because I think it’s so needed,” she said. “I really enjoyed being a part of this, but to me, the ‘this’ has changed. The need to have purpose-driven, mission-driven people support and build a league has changed. The billionaires want a part. And that’s in the last two years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What does the boom feel like to longtime fans?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Sky announced they would play their inaugural season at the UIC Pavilion in 2006, Leslie Pilot-Gatton was thrilled. Her daughter was just beginning to fall in love with basketball, and season tickets felt like a way to support that interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the city’s South Side, organized basketball opportunities for girls were limited. Pilot-Gatton often found herself driving north so her daughter could play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was really important to have the Sky, for girls to be able to go out and watch women play basketball and have something to look up to,” Pilot-Gatton told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team moved to Rosemont’s Allstate Arena from 2010 to 2017, she attended fewer games. But when the Sky returned to the city at Wintrust Arena near McCormick Place, Pilot-Gatton bought season tickets again, this time some of the best seats in the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her fandom reflects the sense of pride and stewardship many women’s basketball fans feel. She tries — and often succeeds — at getting others hooked. She once brought her trainer, a father of young girls, to a game, and he became a season ticket holder the following season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a30000\" name=\"image-a30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0d52900/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3118x1750+0+272/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2Ff1%2F928d15e24a1bb8bcbe857a6d285f%2Fleslie.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e0b839/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3118x1750+0+272/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2Ff1%2F928d15e24a1bb8bcbe857a6d285f%2Fleslie.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bfc71b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3118x1750+0+272/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2Ff1%2F928d15e24a1bb8bcbe857a6d285f%2Fleslie.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"leslie.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bfc71b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3118x1750+0+272/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2Ff1%2F928d15e24a1bb8bcbe857a6d285f%2Fleslie.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c025dbf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3118x1750+0+272/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2Ff1%2F928d15e24a1bb8bcbe857a6d285f%2Fleslie.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bfc71b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3118x1750+0+272/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1a%2Ff1%2F928d15e24a1bb8bcbe857a6d285f%2Fleslie.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leslie Pilot-Gatton (center) converts her personal trainer (Erik Treese, left) and family into a season ticket holder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leslie Gatton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite her love for the Bears and White Sox, she calls the Sky “the best game in town” because they play more of a team game. It excites her the way the energy in the stadium has grown as the league’s profile has risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 2025 season, the Sky played &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2025/08/14/from-sellouts-to-the-reese-effect-sky-attendance-tells-a-bigger-story\"   &gt;two sellout games at the United Center&lt;/a&gt; and averaged nearly 10,000. Popularity, however, has come with rising prices: Pilot-Gatton paid $30 per game during the 2021 championship season. Now those same seats cost about $145.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She worries about what that could mean for the crowd’s makeup. Part of what she loves about the Sky, she said, is that fans come in “all shapes and sizes and ages and colors.” But she plans to renew as long as she can afford it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t want them to leave,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She just hopes rising ticket prices will translate into higher salaries and better resources for players — and that those players can become “more a part of the city.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How has player power changed?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holding tightly to what you have has long been part of women’s basketball, especially when the WNBA was young and resources were slim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Sky’s inaugural season in 2006, minimum salaries for players were $30,000. The team practiced at Moody Bible Institute. Their athletic trainer also served as equipment manager and director of basketball operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the circumstances didn’t bother Chelsea Newton, then in her second year in the league.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You got to understand: I came from Sacramento in the expansion draft. We just won the championship,” Newton told the Sun-Times. “You’re on cloud nine. Like, this is amazing. I don’t care how much money I get paid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Housing was covered.

Three of the original eight teams folded in the mid-2000s, including the storied Houston Comets. Players felt a sense of precarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Newton pushes back on the notion that women’s basketball has only just burst onto the scene. The year Newton won the championship in Sacramento, the team drew as many fans as Angel Reese’s rookie season with the Sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waves of interest and pockets of support for women’s basketball have existed for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the modern era, though, television exposure and social media have propelled player profiles. In 2021, the NCAA changed the rules to allow players to profit off their name, image and likeness. That led to endorsement deals and accelerating visibility for stars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reese now has more than 5 million followers on Instagram, and the 2023 national championship game between LSU and Iowa drew almost 10 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those numbers validated something that Friedman and other early Sky investors admit they didn’t see coming: women’s basketball has tremendous market potential. WNBA franchise valuations have soared in anticipation of further growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players are no longer “just grateful” to have a league. During collective-bargaining negotiations, they have rejected proposals that include salaries topping $1 million, pushed for a revenue-sharing model closer to major men’s leagues, and authorized a strike if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love the fact that the players stand up for themselves,” Newton said. “I love the fact that these are the talks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newton is close with many current WNBA players, including the Sky’s 2021 Finals MVP Kahleah Copper, who she coached at Rutgers. She lived the league’s fragile beginnings and now mentors the NIL generation as an associate head coach at Texas A&amp;amp;M.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That dual perspective informs her view of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just want it to work out for both sides and to make sure that the players get what they need and the league survives and continues to grow,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How should the WNBA deal with resource disparities?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When money floods into a space, it rarely distributes evenly. Newton is living the disparities NIL has created in the college game, as programs without deep pockets struggle to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same dynamics apply in the WNBA. Some teams have built gleaming practice facilities and robust medical and performance staff. Other teams are still playing in tiny arenas and practicing in shared spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why players are fighting for minimum standards in the next CBA. Discussing the latest round of negotiations on her podcast, Liberty star Breanna Stewart said players are demanding that every team provide resources that support performance, including chefs, massage therapists and dedicated practice facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stewart even suggested that owners who can’t meet the new standard should consider selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a current player’s perspective, it's tempting to boot the stragglers and invite in the billionaires. But history is a cautionary tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Newton’s experience in Sacramento showed, an owner’s willingness to endure the lulls matters as much as investment during boom times. The Monarchs’ owner abruptly folded the team in 2009 after attendance dipped, shifting his focus to the NBA’s Sacramento Kings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the league booms, long-term commitment should count for something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sky score highly on the commitment-o-meter: Alter and company are the longest-tenured independent (non-NBA affiliated) owners in the league.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the willingness-to-adapt category where the Sky are unproven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ve taken steps to modernize the team, with &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2026/02/06/skys-new-practice-facility-will-be-ready-by-late-spring-ceo-adam-fox-says\"   &gt;a new practice facility coming in Bedford Park&lt;/a&gt;. But a resistance to change lingers. They were the last team in the league to separate the coach and general manager roles, and as of the 2025 season, the team’s strength and conditioning coach was still organizing travel logistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alter has choices to make. In a league reshaped by money and modern expectations, the Sky’s mission may need reimagining.&lt;/p&gt;",

           \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Sistema fue fundado en 1975 por el economista y director José Antonio Abreu, un exministro de cultura que utilizó su influencia política para convertir a El Sistema en un programa dirigido por el estado. El auge petrolero del país alimentó el rápido crecimiento de El Sistema, organizado en los llamados &lt;i&gt;núcleos&lt;/i&gt; —como el que dirigía Guerrero en Táchira— a lo largo de los 23 estados de Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Su orquesta principal, la Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar se convirtió en una sensación global después de &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8wS-1Eqonk\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;una actuación explosiva en los BBC Proms de 2007&lt;/a&gt;, vistiendo rompevientos con la bandera venezolana. Más recientemente, la orquesta abrió para Coldplay durante sus 10 conciertos agotados en el Wembley Stadium el verano pasado, con el vocalista Chris Martin &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW29-Tgwcz4&amp;amp;list=RDGW29-Tgwcz4&amp;amp;start_radio=1\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;elogiándola en el escenario&lt;/a&gt; como “quizás la mejor orquesta del mundo”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahora, los exalumnos de El Sistema están notoriamente bien representados en instituciones de música clásica y conservatorios en todas partes. Este otoño, el director de orquesta nacido en Venezuela, Gustavo Dudamel, de 45 años, asumirá las riendas del puesto de música clásica más visible de América, la Filarmónica de Nueva York, mientras sigue actuando como director musical de la Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar. Su colega director Rafael Payare, quien participó en El Sistema al mismo tiempo que Dudamel, dirige las sinfonías de San Diego y Montreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y los músicos venezolanos son miembros de algunas de las mejores orquestas del mundo, desde la Filarmónica de Berlín hasta nuestra propia Sinfónica de Chicago (CSO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Las personas hablan de petróleo, especialmente hoy en día en Venezuela”, contó Guerrero. “Honestamente, es la música clásica profesional la que puede ser la exportación más grande de ese país”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-3096f4\" name=\"image-3096f4\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7ef5e72/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bcc5b41/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6e19f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Giancarlo Guerrero, artistic director and principal conductor of Chicago&amp;#x27;s Grant Park Music Festival.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6e19f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c5ac3a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c6e19f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9f%2Fb8%2F7cd1524c4d69907ecc8ace381ea6%2Fgiancarlo-05xx25-22.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Debo básicamente mi carrera a El Sistema y Venezuela”, dijo Giancarlo Guerrero, director artístico y director principal del Festival de Música de Grant Park de Chicago, en una reciente entrevista telefónica con WBEZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victor Hilitski for the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;En medio de un punto álgido en las relaciones entre Estados Unidos y Venezuela y el aumento de la aplicación de la ley de inmigración doméstica, el futuro de esa exportación nunca ha estado tan en cuestión.

Esas excepciones se redujeron aún más &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/suspension-of-visa-issuance-to-foreign-nationals-to-protect-the-security-of-the-united-states.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;en enero&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esto significa incertidumbre para los músicos venezolanos que de otro modo podrían haberse trasladado a Chicago para perseguir su carrera, ya sea en los muchos conservatorios de primer nivel de la ciudad o a través de oportunidades profesionales tempranas en la Sinfónica de Chicago, la Orquesta Cívica de Chicago o el Festival de Música de Grant Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tengo dos [estudiantes venezolanos] que quieren venir, que son realmente buenos, y me gustaría que vinieran”, dijo Almita Vamos, una pedagoga de violín radicada en Chicago cuyo prestigioso estudio atrae a estudiantes de todo el mundo. “No sé si puedan”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jugar, cantar y luchar &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Sistema es una organización masiva que desafía una fácil definición. Sus operaciones centrales se relacionan con su red nacional de escuelas de música comunitarias que ofrecen instrucción extracurricular a niños de forma gratuita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sin embargo, también abarca varios conjuntos profesionales, todos en la cúspide de sus respectivos núcleos. Los estudiantes destacados, sin importar cuán jóvenes sean, pueden progresar y unirse a las filas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El nicaragüense Guerrero, criado en Costa Rica, señala que niños tan jóvenes como de 12 y 13 años tocaban junto a músicos veteranos en su orquesta profesional en Táchira. A veces, miembros de diversos niveles del núcleo tocan juntos para eventos especiales, un espectáculo de rendimiento orquestal que también sirve como experiencia de aprendizaje para los músicos más jóvenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estábamos haciendo sinfonías de Beethoven con 400 músicos”, recordó Guerrero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incluso en sus primeros años, el enfoque de El Sistema en la educación en conjunto —al principio en la educación orquestal, con coros añadidos más tarde— lo distinguió de otros programas de música gratuitos. El fundador José Antonio Abreu codificó la misión de El Sistema como una de elevación social, trazando paralelismos entre la naturaleza colaborativa de un conjunto musical y la participación cívica. Más idealísticamente, El Sistema se posiciona como una forma para que Venezuela conquiste la creciente pobreza y la violencia de pandillas —reflejado en su mantra de “jugar, cantar y luchar”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Se veía al proyecto siempre como desarrollo nacional en lugar de desarrollo cultural o artístico”, dice Norma Núñez-Ruch, gerente de operaciones del lugar del Loop &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/music/2024/10/17/guarneri-hall-performances-chicago-classical-music-venue\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Guarneri Hall&lt;/a&gt; y del Centro Cultural Segundo Ruiz Belvis en el vecindario de Hermosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Núñez-Ruch, de 39 años, se formó en la viola a través de El Sistema y ocupó puestos administrativos en el programa durante seis años antes de trabajar en algunos programas de derivación en Estados Unidos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Después de que la Orquesta Simón Bolívar, y por extensión El Sistema, deslumbrara al mundo hace 20 años, surgieron programas imitadores en comunidades con pocos recursos en todo el mundo. Algunos de los ejemplos más prominentes en Estados Unidos incluyen la Orquesta Juvenil de Los Ángeles (YOLA) de la Filarmónica de Los Ángeles y el programa OrchKids de la Sinfonía de Baltimore, una creación del director principal de Ravinia, Marin Alsop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nivel local, la programación Reach Teach Play de Ravinia también incluye un &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicagophilharmonic.org/national-seminario-ravinia-recap/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;pilar inspirado en el Sistema para estudiantes orquestales&lt;/a&gt;, al igual que &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://peoplesmusicschool.org/50years/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;la Escuela de Música del Pueblo&lt;/a&gt; en el vecindario de Uptown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-195ae6\" name=\"image-195ae6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff90fc4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5c%2F3f%2F2b8082114ac38a42ddec513f88e2%2Fraviniareno-080925-9.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2fb02e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5c%2F3f%2F2b8082114ac38a42ddec513f88e2%2Fraviniareno-080925-9.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24d53a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5c%2F3f%2F2b8082114ac38a42ddec513f88e2%2Fraviniareno-080925-9.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"El Teatro Sandra K.

Músicos de cualquier edad pueden avanzar hacia sus orquestas profesionales remuneradas y, en muchos casos, los niños son pagados lo suficiente como para convertirse en los principales sostenedores de su familia. Esto incentiva la participación y progresión de los estudiantes en El Sistema, pero también a veces le confiere un brutal sentido de competencia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tengo un amigo muy cercano que me dijo que ganaba más dinero a los 20 que su padre, que era ingeniero”, dice Ricardo Lorenz, un compositor nacido en Venezuela que ahora enseña en la Universidad Estatal de Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenz y Núñez-Ruch recuerdan ambos una época en la que esos salarios eran suficientes para mantener a los músicos dentro de Venezuela. Pero cuando su economía colapsó en la década de 2010, incluso El Sistema, que estaba bien financiado, ya no tenía fondos para retener a los músicos. Un aumento en la elección de músicos por estudiar y trabajar en el extranjero siguió, y la pérdida de Venezuela se convirtió en la ganancia del mundo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donde la música y la política chocan &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Sistema y el propio Abreu han sido objeto de críticas generalizadas tanto dentro como fuera de Venezuela durante años.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El programa fue fundado más de 20 años antes de la presidencia de Hugo Chávez, cuya ideología populista sentó las bases para el autoritarismo más austero de su sucesor, Nicolás Maduro. Pero el grado en que El Sistema ha sido utilizado como una herramienta de propaganda por ambos regímenes ha llevado a acusaciones de oportunismo político y “artwashing”, en otras palabras, usar la cultura para distraer de una sombría realidad política.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La pianista venezolana Gabriela Montero, que actúa regularmente con orquestas de clase mundial como la Sinfónica de Chicago, es una de esos críticos. Ella dijo al Times de Londres el año pasado que “ya no es moralmente aceptable albergar orquestas de propiedad y operadas por estados forajidos como mecanismos de poder e influencia suave”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muchos han instado a Dudamel a tomar una postura firme similar. Aunque el director &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2017/05/04/526897569/gustavo-dudamel-addresses-venezuelas-leaders-enough-is-enough\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;ha criticado al régimen de Maduro en el pasado&lt;/a&gt; —más notablemente en 2017, cuando un estudiante de El Sistema fue asesinado por soldados durante una protesta— sigue siendo el director musical de la Orquesta Sinfónica Simón Bolívar, el conjunto más prestigioso de El Sistema, y un defensor de la organización en general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-711533\" name=\"image-711533\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b789b29/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a0dd07/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e460fea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"La Orquesta Sinfónica de Chicago ensaya la Sinfonía No. 1 en sol menor, Sueños de invierno (o Sueños invernales), Op. 13 en el Loop, el miércoles 17 de abril de 2024.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e460fea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7c34cce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e460fea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F91%2Ffd9210c64c819a5cc5abf1d41704%2Fsteinberg-04xx24-12.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los músicos venezolanos son miembros de algunas de las mejores orquestas del mundo, desde la Filarmónica de Berlín hasta nuestra propia Sinfónica de Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuando trabajó para El Sistema durante los años de Chávez, Núñez-Ruch señala que muchos dentro de la organización eran claros sobre las realidades políticas de Venezuela. Al mismo tiempo, El Sistema recibe aproximadamente el 80% de su financiación del gobierno venezolano, dejando a la organización esencialmente atrapada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“En mi percepción, [la actitud de El Sistema] era, ‘Di lo que quieras decir siempre y cuando podamos sostener el trabajo’. Esa es parte de la estrategia política de la organización y su liderazgo”, asegura Núñez-Ruch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La disfunción del gobierno venezolano y sus tendencias de fuerza a veces se traducen en El Sistema mismo. Mientras vivía en Chicago a principios de 2000, Lorenz estaba ayudando a liderar un programa comunitario con la Sinfónica de Chicago en Pilsen. Abreu instó a Lorenz a forjar una conexión entre la CSO y El Sistema, que nunca se concretó.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero Abreu, que siempre fue “solidario” con la carrera de Lorenz, más tarde se comunicó preguntando si Lorenz estaría interesado en regresar a Venezuela. Mientras Lorenz consideraba la oferta, Chávez nombró al compositor para reemplazar al actual presidente del Instituto Universitario de Estudios Musicales de Caracas a través de su programa de televisión semanal, “Aló Presidente”. Lorenz se sorprendió. Solo había estado en conversaciones preliminares para el puesto, que rápidamente declinó. El episodio efectivamente puso fin a su relación con Abreu. “Él estaba muy decepcionado después de eso”, recuerda Lorenz. (Abreu falleció en 2018).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Más recientemente, el académico británico Geoffrey Baker ha sembrado dudas sobre la idea de que el programa prioriza la elevación social. En ausencia de datos demográficos, que El Sistema mantiene en privado, su libro de 2014, “El Sistema: Orchestrating Venezuela's Youth”, se basó en cientos de entrevistas y un año observando los núcleos de El Sistema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los hallazgos de Baker indicaron que el programa atendía a un núcleo demográfico de niños de clases media-alta, con estudiantes pobres en minoría.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Además, Baker observó que la filosofía educativa “revolucionaria” de El Sistema era, si acaso, retrógrada. Los núcleos más a menudo parecían viejas escuelas europeas donde las horas interminables de práctica eran la norma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pensé ingenuamente que cuando Abreu muriera y más músicos abandonaran el país, algunos comenzarían a hablar sobre los problemas”, escribió Baker a WBEZ por correo electrónico. “Pero no conté con el hecho de que el buen nombre de El Sistema era esencial para sus perspectivas laborales en el extranjero, era su boleto de comida”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-3d0ae6\" name=\"image-3d0ae6\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04d6664/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9d80562/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bad3ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Los manifestantes se reúnen en Water Tower Park en el centro para denunciar el arresto del presidente venezolano Maduro y los asesinatos de Renee Nicole Good y Silverio Villegas González, involucrando a ICE, como parte de un día nacional de acción, el sábado 10 de enero de 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bad3ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e0fe5f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bad3ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fde%2Fb722f4614163949410d8b02d0d2e%2Ficeprotest-260111-028.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los manifestantes se reúnen en Water Tower Park, en el centro de Chicago, en enero de 2026 para denunciar el arresto del presidente de Venezuela, Maduro.

Pero siente que El Sistema operaba con más agilidad política de lo que a menudo se le da crédito. Ella señala el uso de simbolismo venezolano en las giras de El Sistema en lugar del logo del Partido Socialista Unido, en un momento en que esa imagen era omnipresente dentro de Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gestionar eso no es una hazaña pequeña”, dijo Núñez-Ruch sobre la capacidad de la organización para separarse de la iconografía relacionada con Chávez. “Es algo que es muy heroico, y solo en retrospectiva, y fuera del país, puedo ver lo magistral que fue no cruzar esa línea”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorenz también “debe una deuda de gratitud” a El Sistema, escribió por correo electrónico, a pesar de sus propios sentimientos encontrados. El próximo mes, Dudamel dirigirá una &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.laphil.com/musicdb/pieces/7415/humboldts-nature\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;nueva obra&lt;/a&gt; de Lorenz para conmemorar su última temporada con la Filarmónica de Los Ángeles, que ha liderado desde 2009. La pieza está inspirada en el paisaje de Venezuela: la escarpada costa oriental, los pájaros gorjeando en la Cueva del Guácharo de seis millas de largo y los tambores resonando sobre el Lago Tacarigua, al norte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“La parte triste de todas estas cosas que han sucedido en el último mes es que están tratando de llevarnos 100 años atrás, donde lo único que tiene Venezuela es el petróleo”, dice Lorenz. “Pensé que habíamos superado eso”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Tracey’s parents were in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracey, 36, was found dead Oct. 27 at the bottom of a stairwell in a South Loop high-rise after residents of the building found a severed foot in the stairwell. Prosecutors said Beckerink, a Chicago lawyer, pushed Tracey off of a 24th floor railing of their building in the 1200 block of South Prairie Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracey had been in a relationship with Beckerink since 2022. They lived together at the South Loop condo, but Tracey also owned a home in New Buffalo, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracey obtained an order of protection against Beckerink in Cook County in 2023 after multiple domestic battery reports to Chicago police, but later dropped it after he threatened to sue her for defamation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said Tracey had disclosed to a court-appointed victim advocate that Beckerink had previously threatened to throw her over a flight of stairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He served a 93-day sentence last year in the Berrien County jail in Michigan for domestic abuse against Tracey. He was arrested by Chicago police officers and U.S. Marshals Great Lakes Regional Fugitive Task Force after he was released on Jan. 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly before 11:30 p.m. Oct. 25, 2024, four residents in the South Loop high-rise reported hearing an “unusually loud noise” that sounded like something striking metal from inside the building’s stairwell, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 3 a.m. the next morning, surveillance camera footage showed Beckerink hauling a luggage cart filled with jackets and bags from the building’s parking garage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later that day, Beckerink told the building’s concierge, whom he had befriended while living there, that Tracey had been missing since 10 p.m. the day before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beckerink later filed a missing person report with Chicago police, telling officers that Tracey had left their home around 9 or 10 p.m. the night before to go for a run and didn’t bring her phone or keys with her. He also told officers that he had been in Michigan and hadn’t seen Tracey in more than a month, according to prosecutors. However, detectives found building surveillance video showing the two together on Oct. 24, according to a Chicago police report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveillance footage from the condo didn’t show Tracey leaving the building around the time that Beckerink had reported, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day after Tracey’s body was found, Beckerink was arrested and accused of filing a false police report. He was later released without charges being filed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Tracey’s death, her parents and Beckerink fought over the custody of her remains. A Michigan judge eventually granted custody to Tracey’s parents, and a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2024/11/15/caitlin-tracey-adam-beckerink-south-loop-high-rise-stairwell\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Cook County judge&lt;/a&gt; later accepted that ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beckerink is due back in court on March 18.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Jan Schakowsky has withdrawn her endorsement of Cook County Commissioner Donna Miller in the 2nd Congressional District race over Miller receiving campaign funding  from American Israel Public Affairs Committee donors — and an AIPAC super PAC that is running TV ads to support her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schakowsky endorsed Miller on Jan. 29 — with the congresswoman saying Miller \"has spent her career fighting for families, veterans, seniors and working people throughout Cook County.\" But Schakowsky earlier this month decided to pull that endorsement amid a flurry of media reports and accounts from 2nd Congressional District candidates of Miller receiving money from AIPAC donors and an AIPAC-affiliated super PAC running ads benefiting her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schakowsky first confirmed the withdrawal of her endorsement to the Chicago Sun-Times Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Illinois deserves leaders who put voters first, not AIPAC or out-of-state Trump donors,\" Schakowsky said in a statement to the Sun-Times. \"I cannot support any candidate running for Congress who is funded by these outside interests. That is one of the many reasons I am supporting Daniel Biss in IL-09. Daniel will always put Illinois families ahead of outside influence.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schakowsky made the Miller endorsement before she was aware of outside money coming into the race, including from donors supportive of President Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a forum in Thornton Township Saturday, Miller was asked about Schakowsky's endorsement but declined to provide details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I've been friends with Jan Schakowksy for over 20 years,\" Miller said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A super PAC called Affordable Chicago Now has spent $868,000 to help Miller in TV ads that highlight her work for Planned Parenthood of Illinois. Miller has also reported more than $875,000 in contributions from donors who have given to AIPAC, the powerful pro-Israel organization, or its affiliated super PAC, the United Democracy Project. The super PAC has received millions of dollars from AIPAC and has spent heavily in Democratic primaries. The super PACS are not allowed to directly coordinate with campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC is playing a role in four congressional races in Illinois — helping to boost Miller in the 2nd; former U.S. Rep. Melissa Bean in the 8th; state Sen. Laura Fine in the 9th; and Chicago City Treasurer Melissa Conyears Ervin in the 7th. United Democracy Project has spent more than $753,000 to support Conyears Ervin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about AIPAC support earlier this month by the Sun-Times, Miller denied she was getting dollars from \"MAGA donors.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't have any MAGA donors. People are contributing to my campaign because I have a strong record. My message is resonating. This is what I'm talking about out in the field,” Miller said. “And who's talking about these other issues? I haven't heard anyone talk about it until my opponents realize that they're losing and they want to attack me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if she supported “unconditional military aid for Israel,” Miller said, “Israel does have a right to exist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I also come from a military family, so I understand the impact that the military has when we're talking about securing our democracy,” Miller said. “So I do feel that we need to make sure that we have a strong Middle East.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller's campaign removed Schakowsky's endorsement on its website and on Facebook. But it remained live on its Instagram page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller is leading fundraising in the crowded field to replace outgoing Rep. Robin Kelly, as former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. vies for his old seat. State Sen. Robert Peters, D-Chicago, has the progressive backing, including a glowing endorsement from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. Rounding out the field are state Sen. Willie Preston; Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Board member Yumeka Brown; Adal Regis, who worked in Kelly’s district office; management consultant Eric France; attorney Patrick “PJK” Keating; Toni C. Brown and Sidney Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schakowsky in January &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/01/07/jan-schakowsky-endorsement-evanston-mayor-daniel-biss-successor-kat-abughazaleh-9th-district\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;endorsed Biss&lt;/a&gt; to replace her in the 9th Congressional District. The longtime Democratic congresswoman also pointedly said that she didn’t want “out-of-state donors and special interests to buy this seat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elect Chicago Women is spending on TV ads benefiting Fine, one of Biss' challengers.  Biss and others say the super PAC is working to benefit AIPAC. Fine has also raised more than $1.2 million in the last reporting period, with about $1 million coming from donors who have given to AIPAC-affiliated groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about AIPAC donors by the Sun-Times earlier this month, Fine said: \"Anybody who's supporting me is supporting my record, supporting a record of getting things changed when it comes to health care, standing up to corporate polluters, making sure Illinois is a 100% pro choice state.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 15 Democratic candidates are running for the 9th Congressional District seat in the primary, including progressive content creator Kat Abughazaleh, Phil Andrew, Bushra Amiwala, state Sen. Mike Simmons, economist Jeff Cohen, state Rep. Hoan Huynh, former federal prosecutor Nick Pyati, veteran Sam Polan, civil rights attorney Howard Rosenblum, Evanston resident Bethany Johnson, union organizer Justin Ford, Patricia A.

Los cuatro migrantes parecían haber sido detenidos recientemente, dijeron los miembros del clero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vimos ojos llorosos, confusión, incertidumbre”, contó el padre Leandro Fossá, pastor de Nuestra Señora del Monte Carmelo en Melrose Park. “También se podía ver que estaban receptivos, así que sintieron la esperanza del momento al ver que la iglesia estaba allí con ellos”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lo que los miembros del clero encontraron dentro de la instalación era un contraste absoluto con lo que habría sido el año pasado durante el operativo de inmigración de la administración de Trump. Las ventanas aún estaban tapiadas y una cerca y otras barreras mantenían a los manifestantes y al público a raya, pero el edificio estaba vacío cuando llegaron, dijeron. Sólo cuatro detenidos llegaron mientras ellos estaban allí, una diferencia notable con los informes del otoño pasado sobre el edificio abarrotado de personas y con poco espacio para dormir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los defensores religiosos de los inmigrantes, incluidas las hermanas fallecidas Pat Murphy y JoAnn Persch, solían visitar regularmente a los inmigrantes detenidos en la instalación de Broadview hasta que la pandemia de COVID-19 llevó las visitas a un formato en línea en 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero después de que se les &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2025/11/04/nuevamente-rechazan-peticion-para-darles-la-comunion-a-detenidos-en-broadview\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;negara el acceso&lt;/a&gt; este otoño mientras la administración de Trump intensificaba su aplicación de inmigración en el área, algunos miembros del clero &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/19/clergy-sue-ice-over-restriction-on-providing-religious-services-to-detainees-intimidation-of-religious\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;demandaron al gobierno federal&lt;/a&gt;. La Coalición por el Liderazgo Espiritual y Público, un demandante en el caso, acusó al gobierno de violar la ley federal y los derechos de la Primera Enmienda de los líderes religiosos y los detenidos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Queremos continuar haciendo lo que hemos podido hacer durante tantos años y que de repente se detuvo con el cambio de dirección”, dijo la hermana Jeremy Midura, una hermana feliciana y una de las demandantes en el juicio. “La hermana Pat y la hermana JoAnn podían entrar en la instalación. Todo eso cambió”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los miembros del clero dijeron que la instalación parecía limpia, a pesar de los informes sobre condiciones de hacinamiento dentro del edificio el otoño pasado, y que los agentes de inmigración fueron serviciales. Dijeron que tienen la intención de programar más visitas a la instalación.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;El cardenal Cupich elogia la injunction que permitió la entrada del clero a la instalación de ICE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;El cardenal Blase Cupich, arzobispo de Chicago, elogió la injunction del juez federal que permitió la entrada del clero en la instalación de ICE. En un comunicado, dijo, “La libertad religiosa es una piedra angular de nuestra democracia y el derecho de las personas encarceladas a recibir cuidado pastoral es reconocido en todo el país”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Más tarde, el miércoles por la noche, Cupich pidió compasión para aquellos atrapados en la intensificación de la aplicación de la ley de inmigración de la administración de Trump mientras hablaba en la Parroquia de Nuestra Señora del Monte Carmelo en Melrose Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cupich les dijo a los feligreses que era una noche para “aquellos que conocen la ansiedad de las sombras, el miedo silencioso de un golpe en la puerta, el llanto del dolor callado cuando estás lejos de familiares que no puedes ver”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aludiendo a las cenizas, generalmente un símbolo de arrepentimiento interno y conciencia espiritual, Cupich recordó a los presentes que también era un signo de que eran “ciudadanos de una patria que no tiene fronteras”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estas cenizas “son una declaración de que, sin importar qué leyes cambien, qué digan los políticos o qué incertidumbres enfrenten, todos ustedes son hijos de Dios”, destacó.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

In a statement, spokesperson Gerald McSwiggan didn’t say why the university cut ties with the program but noted that it “takes seriously its obligation to prohibit unlawful discrimination.” McSwiggan didn’t immediately respond to follow-up questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end of these partnerships is yet another example of how the Trump administration has worked to restrict diversity, equity and inclusion efforts at K-12 schools and colleges, though those efforts &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2026/01/21/trump-administration-drops-legal-appeal-over-anti-dei-funding-threat-to-schools-and-colleges\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;have not always held up in court&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The 31 schools that severed their partnerships also agreed to conduct a review of their work with other organizations to make sure no other programs “restrict participation based on race,” according to the news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite losing these universities as partners, the nonprofit PhD Project will continue its work, a spokesperson said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our vision is to create a broader talent pipeline of current and future business leaders who are committed to excellence and to each other, through networking, mentorship, and unique events,” the spokesperson wrote. “The PhD Project was founded with the goal of providing more role models in the front of business classrooms and this remains our goal today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alleging that programs meant to benefit students of color discriminate against white students in higher education has been a theme of Trump’s second term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after taking office last year, Trump took aim at scholarships and other programs designed to bolster Black, Latino and Indigenous students in higher education..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, the Trump administration &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/10/20/university-illinois-chicago-drops-race-gender-factors-in-faculty-hiring-financial-aid-scholarships\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;has offered incentives like more federal funding for colleges&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that sign a contract aligning with Trump’s political priorities, including banning the consideration of race and gender in admissions and hiring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

They plan to use this spring to experiment with ABS, which is debuting in MLB regular season and postseason games this year, before refining their guidelines on when to challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We gave the players just the basics rules [Thursday],” Counsell said. “Like, you’ve got to tap your head, can't just verbalize it – just real basic stuff. And then just go with it, see what happens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The players had fun with it Tuesday. Shortstop Dansby Swanson was the first to challenge and got an ovation from his teammates when he won the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The graphic played on the video board, showing the ball flying in from the mound. The camera angle spun around its landing spot outside of the strike zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought it was cool,” Swanson told the Sun-Times. \"It's going to be an interesting transition and change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Thursday, Counsell was also calling out challenges – which he won’t be permitted to do during games – to help test the system further on the eve of the Cubs’ game Friday against the White Sox. Select spring training ballparks were ABS-equipped last year, but Sloan was not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ballesteros expected ‘soon’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cubs catcher Moisés Ballesteros is expected to join the team this weekend, after his arrival was delayed by visa issues, Counsell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're optimistic right now he's going to be here shortly,” Counsell said. “If that should happen, I think we're in a good place. He's going to be behind in terms of when you see him in a game. But with the normal spring training schedule, I feel confident in the number of games we're looking at here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs have less “firm information” on veteran catcher Christian Bethancourt’s timetable, Counsell said, as he also deals with visa issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul id=\"rte-587c7042-0de8-11f1-9535-d5d886860bfa\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Counsell was encouraged by the carry and velocity on left-hander Shota Imanaga’s fastball Thursday, during a two-inning live batting practice session.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Left-handed reliever Ryan Rolison was struck above the knee by a line-drive comebacker Thursday while facing right fielder Seiya Suzuki. Rolison finished his inning of live batting practice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",

Nakai and Sakamoto, skating right behind her, each made a mistake on a combination sequence, and that made the difference in the medals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sakamoto scored 224.90 points to earn a silver to go with her bronze from Beijing. Nakai finished third with 219.16 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment Nakai's score was read after the final program of the night, U.S. teammate Amber Glenn jumped up onto the kiss-and-cry stand and raised Liu's hand in triumph. Liu sheepishly turned and applauded the 17-year-old Nakai, who raced over and hugged her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first individual gold medal for an American woman since 2002, when Sarah Hughes stood atop the podium in Salt Lake City, and it was the second gold for Liu at the Milan Cortina Games. She helped the Americans win team gold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medal blended right into her gold-sequined dress, only its blue ribbon standing out. And it seemed to be the perfect complement to the golden stripes through her dark brown hair, which are meant to resemble the growth rings on a tree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu has done a whole lot of growing up over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was the youngest U.S. champion ever when she won the first of back-to-back titles at 13 years old. But after finishing sixth at the Beijing Games, Liu was so burned out that she abruptly retired. She spent the next two years doing bucket-list things like climbing up to the base camp of Mount Everest and enrolling at UCLA, where she is studying psychology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was after a skiing trip, when Liu felt the same adrenaline rush that came with skating, that she contemplated her comeback. But this time, she would be skating on her terms, more happy-go-lucky and self-assured than she had been as a childhood prodigy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even during warmups Thursday night, she skated with a grin on her face, never showing any signs of pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Glenn finished in fifth place behind Mone Chiba of Japan, a stunning rebound from her disastrous short program Tuesday night. Glenn's season-best free skate gave a score of 214.91 points, and it just about landed her on the podium as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glenn pumped her first and fought back tears when her score was read, then she took a seat in the new \"leader's chair.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She wound up sitting there for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adeliia Petrosian, the 18-year-old Russian competing as a neutral athlete at the Milan Cortina Games, tried the only quadruple jump during the women's competition but fell on the quad toe loop. She was clean the rest of the way, but the points Petrosian lost on that fall ended up leaving her less than a half-point behind Glenn in the leader's chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Chiba — the ninth skater to follow the three-time U.S. champ — who finally took over first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That didn't last long with Liu next on the ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reigning world champion — that title was the first for an American in a mere 19 years, by the way — was perfect from her opening triple flip to her closing combination sequence. As the last bits of Donna Summer's rendition of \"MacArthur Park\" closed, and the roar of the fans filled the void, the carefree Liu gave a casual flip of her ponytail as if to say, \"So what?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her coaches, Phillip DiGuglielmo and Massimo Scali, were a little more rambunctious. They punched the air, then gave each other a big hug, before heading over to greet their star pupil when she stepped off the ice to await her score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The score that ultimately would give her an Olympic title and end a long drought for the American women.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

He would have counted $2.4 million against the salary cap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was limited to just eight games last year after starting the season on injured reserve because of a knee injury. He played 133 special teams snaps and 82 more at linebacker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He played a whopping 84% of the Bears’ special teams downs the year before, however. Ogbongbemiga played 25 games for the Bears in two years after joining the team following a three-year stint with the Chargers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 27-year-old had one start for the Bears. His best defensive game came in Week 12 against the Steelers, when he had 14 tackles after replacing the injured Ruben Hyppolite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears currently sit about $3 million above the 2026 salary cap. They must be under it by the start of the league year next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get there, the Bears could consider cutting Tremaine Edmunds, who had four interceptions last year, the second-most of any NFL linebacker. The savings would be massive — $15 million. In the past, Bears general manager Ryan Poles has released such veterans before the NFL Scouting Combine out of courtesy. The Combine starts Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edmunds is due a $1 million roster bonus on the fifth day of the league year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears could also simply restructure the contracts of a few veteran players to get under the cap.  &lt;/p&gt;",

That means if he doesn’t make the Opening Day roster this year, he would have to clear waivers before being sent down to the minors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With last year’s arrivals of former prospects &lt;b&gt;Edgar Quero&lt;/b&gt;, 22, and &lt;b&gt;Kyle Teel&lt;/b&gt;, 24 — and Sox management adamant about both receiving ample experience behind the plate — it almost feels inevitable that someone is the odd man out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The thing that really sticks out is they are all so supportive of each other and work really well together,” Sox manager &lt;b&gt;Will Venable&lt;/b&gt; said this week, adding that he’s seen improvements in each of the three defensively. “I know there’s a lot of competition for a roster spot, for playing time. But they have been extremely supportive of each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee said he’s willing to play anywhere in the field — even outfield, if given the chance. But Venable shot down that possibility immediately. “That’s not a path for him in the outfield. … He’s a catcher for us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teel said the three of them lean on each other in different ways. Lee being the elder of the group, Teel and Quero may look to him for things like daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like there's always that competition. This is the game we play. We're always competing. But it's a great relationship,” said Teel, who will be leaving camp later this month to play in the World Baseball Classic, providing more playing time for Lee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grant Taylor camper of the day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hard-throwing right-hander &lt;b&gt;Grant Taylor&lt;/b&gt; was lights out in his live pitching session to Sox hitters Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After striking out four batters in a row, outfielder &lt;b&gt;Andrew Benintendi&lt;/b&gt; finally hit what would have been a bloop single, resulting in resounding cheers from other hitters in the cage. Taylor allowed just soft contact to a couple other batters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Taylor] looked amazing. Stuff looked really crisp. Just aggressive coming down the mound,” Venable said. “[His stuff] is as good as it gets. Objectively his stuff is I think the best in our organization. He’s a competitor, he’s a guy you like having out there. I think he’s just scratching the surface here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Games begin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox finally start game action Friday against the Cubs at Sloan Park in Mesa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the final scores don’t matter, most spring training games provide an opportunity for players to face opposing teams in live action and for coaches to see how players are making their adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First couple of games, you are not looking or evaluating too much on the performance. You want to make sure they have a sense of what we are trying to do as far as executing players,” Venable said. “There will be a bunch of things that come up, we will end up addressing and kind of re-correcting. We want to sit back and let them get their feet wet and use the information to help us move forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListL\" data-module

He underwent Tommy John surgery soon after the Mets drafted him in the first round in 2016. Then other injuries kept nagging him — back and side discomfort, shoulder discomfort, a blister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It led to him fielding only minor league deals from teams after the 2022 season, but he was hoping to pitch in the big leagues. His agent floated the idea of pitching in Japan, so he made the “no-brainer” decision to move overseas in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when he bounced back with the Yokohama Bay Stars, posting a 3.42 ERA in his first season. He followed that up with a 1.54 ERA the next season and then finished with a 1.74 ERA last year, good for second best in the Nippon Professional Baseball league, where he crossed paths with new Sox slugger Munetaka Murakami (who hit .400 off Kay but no home runs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kind of just finding a good routine in between each start and making sure that my body is right for the next one, I think, was the biggest thing that I learned over there in Japan,” Kay said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that success, Kay finds himself a spot in the Sox rotation, which is searching for consistent starters. Last year’s All-Star Shane Smith and the team’s longest-tenured player Davis Martin, are the only other two that have secured a starting role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kay has already talked with teammate Erick Fedde, who took a similar career path when he pitched in Korea and returned in 2024 and provided one of the few bright spots that season for the Sox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think just seeing the guys before us have success [overseas] … and then came back and had more success, I think that was huge,” Kay said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old left hander is using this Spring Training to readjust back to facing MLB hitters. He added a sinker to his arsenal while in Japan, alongside a four-seam fastball, slider, sweeper and a sporadic changeup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitters in Japan tend to have more flat swings, he noted, making it easier for them to catch up to high fastballs, which led to the development of his sinker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was sitting behind his bullpen the other day and it’s really, really electric stuff,” said catcher Korey Lee. “[He] knows how to pinpoint some pitches, kind of more of that pitchability type of guy and knows where he’s going to throw it rather than that overpowering stuff. He’s still throwing really, really hard but at the end of the day, it’s more about the location for him rather than the velo and the stuff, and I think that plays on the team really, really well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White Sox showed great interest in Kay once he indicated a return to the MLB, but Kay said he settled with the Sox because, “You see the plan that they have for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You see the future and you see all the exciting young talent that all these guys have, and I think it’s a fun time to be part of this organization,” he said. “And I think [we’re] definitely going to either shock some people and I think this team is going to make some noise.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListL\" data-module  data-hide-authors=\"true\"

These conditions led units to deteriorate and contributed to neighborhood destabilization, the investigation found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The housing authority has 2,800 scattered units, with more than 450 sitting vacant. Of those vacant units, approximately 78% are located in communities of color, the lawsuit said. The CHA is the largest single owner of rental housing in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scattered units are small- to mid-sized apartment buildings and single-family homes. In 2023, the agency announced a push to renovate its &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/11/27/23975023/cha-property-renovation-restore-home-program-tracey-scott-scattered-sites\"   &gt;scattered sites portfolio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Answers Project and Block Club Chicago published an &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/11/29/as-city-battles-housing-shortage-cha-lets-hundreds-of-empty-homes-decay/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 about the CHA’s chronic vacancy issues with scattered site units. The CHA’s inspector general office also reported in recent years on the agency’s inappropriate maintenance of the properties, including its failure to comply with the city’s vacant buildings ordinance by registering, securing and maintaining the properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These properties should be maintained at a standard worthy of the communities they exist in — and that standard still applies when those communities are Black and Latine,” Josefina Navar, deputy director at HOPE Fair Housing Center, said in a Wednesday news release. “Every day that a unit sits abandoned or in disrepair is a major disservice to both these communities and the thousands of families lingering on the waiting lists for housing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CHA’s waitlist numbers in the thousands for its housing programs, with some applicants waiting up to decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHA spokesperson Matthew Aguilar said the agency hasn’t been formally served with the lawsuit and can’t comment on pending litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manage Chicago CEO Chris Amatore said in a statement that many of the incidents mentioned in the lawsuit predate his company’s involvement. The property management firm took over in July 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since assuming responsibility, we have operated within the scope of our contractual authority with CHA regarding maintenance and security matters,” Amatore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to comment further, citing the pending litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hispanic Housing Development declined to comment and said it hasn’t been formally served with the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humboldt Park resident and plaintiff Caroline Bermudez has lived next to a CHA property at 849 N. St. Louis Ave., which has been vacant for nearly a decade, according to the suit. The single-family home was previously managed by Hispanic Housing and is now operated by Manage Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bermudez experienced “persistent disruptive activity, found used drug paraphernalia in her yard, and endured repeated incidents that made her home environment unlivable and unsafe,” according to the lawsuit. The property’s conditions, described as a “stash house with significant narcotics activity,” led her and her partner to temporarily relocate to live with family for more than a year, due to safety concerns. While they were gone, people broke into their house and left a stolen vehicle with a loaded firearm inside her garage, according to the suit. She’s now back in her home, despite continued issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She brought her complaint to HOPE, which spurred its investigation. Bermudez and her neighbors reported the issues to city agencies, law enforcement and the CHA, according to the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m angry because I had to relocate out of the house because the city and CHA have refused to do anything,” Bermudez told the Sun-Times. “It is a systemic failure on multiple levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the lawsuit, Bermudez hopes the CHA makes the home next door habitable for a family in need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I call on city officials — the City Council and the mayor — to finally hold CHA accountable for its negligent practices,” Bermudez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor’s office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new discrimination lawsuit is salt in the wound for the embattled housing authority, as it scrambles to address a recent &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2026/02/11/cha-hud-federal-disability-civil-rights-laws-ada-whistleblower-complaint\"   &gt;whistleblower complaint&lt;/a&gt; alleging dysfunction of the agency’s reasonable accommodations process for residents with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Records show the CHA violated federal disability laws and the civil rights of residents for at least eight years — leading to negotiations for a voluntary compliance agreement between the CHA and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2026/02/11/cha-hud-federal-disability-civil-rights-laws-ada-whistleblower-complaint\"   &gt;CHA has violated disability, civil rights laws for years, whistleblower and HUD say&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/11/15/cha-residents-frustrated-housing-agency-permanent-ceo\"   &gt;CHA residents grow frustrated as agency marks one year without permanent CEO&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Jones lost his sight and while recovering found an interest in music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Wilson heard the story and purchased a piano and had it delivered to his home as an anonymous gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones became a professional musician. His story was told in multiple appearances on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Wilson visited Jones after the shooting to share some encouraging words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He told me that I can still do anything I set my mind to, and there's a place for me in this world,\" recalled Jones, now 46. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones didn't learn until years after the shooting that the piano was a gift from Mr. Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It just shows you the big heart he had, he didn't want it to be about him, he wanted it to be about me and helping me. Music is what basically carried me through those tough times,\" Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Rutherford was retiring that year, and in lieu of throwing a retirement party for himself, he took that money and bought the piano,\" said his wife, Wanza Wilson. \"He was so moved by that boy's story.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Wilson, who was on the police force for 28 years, died Jan. 17 from natural causes. He was 87.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He saw early in his police career how bad things could get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was one of the first officers on the scene after Richard Speck killed eight student nurses who roomed together at a South Side townhouse in 1966. After Speck fled, a ninth roommate emerged from her hiding place under a bed, climbed out a window and began screaming for help. The crime shocked the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later, in 1992, Mr. Wilson had a close encounter with a serial killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Wilson had just emerged from a South Side grocery store when three men robbed him of his pager and cash. Mr. Wilson quickly had the pager deactivated and got a new one with the same number. He then intercepted calls to the pager intended for the robbers and spoke with a girl whom Mr. Wilson persuaded to provide him with the name of one of the men who robbed him: Ralph Harris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris was charged with the robbery and while out on parole and awaiting trial in the summer of 1992 committed four murders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Wilson was also a businessman who owned and operated five motels — four on the South Side and one on the West Side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He would get those motels and clean them up,\" recalled his wife, noting that Mr. Wilson had three other partners in the venture, including one other Chicago police detective. \"Some of them were vice ridden to begin with, and these young detectives took a chance with the investment, and Rutherford promised his supervisors that they were coming in there to clean the businesses up and they'd be reputable, and they did.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He hired dozens of people from the community to work at the motels, his wife said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He loved this neighborhood, and people respected him because he was doing good, and he loved being a police officer and catching the bad guy,\" his wife said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retired Chicago police officer Thomas Wortham III said Mr. Wilson was there for him after one of the darkest times in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, outside his Chatham home, Wortham's son, Thomas Wortham IV, was shot and killed by thieves who tried to steal his motorcycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n

In Knight's case, he believed he could, so he started both of the Hawks' last two games against the Sharks and Blue Jackets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believed he could for perhaps the most Knightian reasons imaginable, too, considering all the Hawks have come to know about his thorough, philosophical and sometimes superhuman approach to life and hockey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I don't like speaking things into existence, and I saw it as a test,\" Knight said Thursday. \"The way I look at it is ... putting yourself in different situations is how you're going to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Learning how to navigate not feeling well at all physically —&amp;nbsp;and learning how to play with that —&amp;nbsp;is really valuable going into the future. If there's times where you have to play —&amp;nbsp;or maybe you're in the playoffs — you've got to figure something out. For me, it gives me more experience, which is good. I want to grab as much experience as I can.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes his immune system was weakened by a delayed Hawks flight the week before that didn't arrive in Pittsburgh until nearly 3 a.m., and he would like to see the NHL shift more toward flying the morning after games rather than overnight. But that's a topic for another day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Olympic break did turn out to be perfectly timed, giving him time to get back to true 100%. He relaxed with friends and family in Connecticut and Massachusetts and then escaped to the beaches of Florida, where he also got lunch with Panthers goalie and longtime mentor Sergei Bobrovsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The value of this February rest has been much-discussed in regards to the Hawks' plethora of rookie forwards and defensemen, but it makes sense it would be even more valuable for their goalies. Knight's &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2025/11/30/blackhawks-nhl-goalie-spencer-knight-off-ice-habits-red-light-mat\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;unique off-ice habits&lt;/a&gt; designed to maximize his health and recovery can only do so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Knight isn't a rookie, this is his first season as a full-time starter in the NHL, and that experience has been eye-opening. He has already made 39 starts this season, compared to 36, 0, 19 and 27 starts in each of the last four seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I've been able to be really intentional observing and anticipating things [to figure out] what to expect,\" he said. \"But there's still situations you don't expect, right? And you just learn how to go [with it]. &lt;i&gt;... &lt;/i&gt;Whatever I have in that moment before the game, that's what I've got. I'll just do what I can.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knight raced out of the gates this season with a splendid .924 save percentage and plus-12.8 GSAA in his first 15 starts. He led the league in GSAA and led full-time starters in save percentage at that point (Nov. 24).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But since then, he has been only a league-average goalie, posting an .895 save percentage and minus-0.1 GSAA over his last 24 starts. (The league average save percentage of .896 this season is the lowest since 1993-94.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He still sits in the top 10 in total GSAA, but it would be great to see him finish this breakout season with a hot stretch run. That would likely have a snowball effect on the Hawks' overall team success and morale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he's not working on anything specific technique-wise right now, but he plans to evaluate that in April. He likes to keep skating immediately after the season and then take a break later in the summer instead of taking it right away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-890005\" name=\"list-890005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, anchorId=list-890005, pullQuoteIcon=[{image=null, narrowImage=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=null}], relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, _styledTemplate=/page/list/PageListH.hbs, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, carouselSpeed=null, buttonHoverBgColor=#a91d23, rteHeadingFont=font-1, secondaryColor=#656565, hideCategories=true, _template=/page/list/includes/PageList-header.hbs, font3=Arial, font4=Source-serif-4, ctaUrl=null, pagination=[{body=[Next Page], href=?p=2, _template=/link/Link.hbs, contentId=null, pianoSectionSlug=null, target=null}], hideImage=false, suppressPagination=true, footerLinkHoverColor=#d3242c, hideAudioPlayback=false, description=[], showSecondItemMedia=false, listColumns234=null, footerTextColor=#ffffff, headerSecondaryBgColor=#000000, primaryTextColorInverse=#ffffff, titleColor=null, title=Latest on the Blackhawks, ampLink=null, listHeaderPosition=null, hideDescriptions=false, showActionBar=true, linkHoverColor=#d3242c, buttonBgColor=#d3242c, ctaTarget=null, promoButtonText=null, backgroundColor=null, headerSecondaryTextColor=#ffffff, count=8139, listTitleFont=font-2, headlineFont=font-1, promoDescriptionFont=font-3, primaryColor=#d3242c, slimFooter=false, hideHeadline=false, hideDates=true, headerBorderColor=#e9e9e9, ratingCardFont=font-1, titleTarget=null, tableCaptionColor=#626262, items=[{type=Image, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/olympic-sports/2026/02/18/united-states-beats-sweden-2-1-in-ot-advances-to-olympic-mens-hockey-semis, publishDate=February 18, 2026 04:52 PM, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/associated-press, name=[{items=[AP]}], bio=[{items=[The Associated Press is an independent, not-for-profit news cooperative headquartered in New York City.

But if the Cubs don’t come to extension agreements with any of their walk-year players, they’ll be facing a roster overhaul this offseason, affecting the lineup, rotation and bullpen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cubs president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer has pointed out the advantages of financial flexibility after this season. But with the current collective bargaining agreement expiring on Dec. 1, if the owners lock out the players — &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/18/mlb-players-association-bracing-for-lockout-before-2027-season-all-but-guaranteed-bruce-meyer-executive-director\"   &gt;as MLB players association interim executive director Bruce Meyer said he expects&lt;/a&gt; — the timeline to pull off that overhaul could be tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Both on a position player level and pitching level, we have a lot of free agents,” Hoyer said at the start of spring training. “It's going to be a topic of conversation, there's no question, with those free agents. I think we look at it as, players need to focus on right now, focus on this team.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The front office, however, is looking ahead. Hoyer and his group knew this was coming. It was somewhat by design, as they kept the end of the CBA in mind while structuring multi-year deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the group, the three everyday hitters — left fielder Ian Happ, second baseman Nico Hoerner and right fielder Seiya Suzuki are the longest tenured. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/16/cubs-chairman-tom-ricketts-on-potential-mlb-broadcast-consolidation-we-love-our-independence\"   &gt;Happ and Suzuki said Monday&lt;/a&gt; that the Cubs have not initiated extension talks. Hoerner declined to comment on the subject of contract negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's plenty of guys that are on their last year here,” Hoerner said. “That's also an opportunity, though, because we've been fortunate to play as a group for a while. It creates excitement in that you don't get to share a locker room with guys in a consistent core a lot in the big leagues. And so to have that opportunity, to have gotten better, and to now be in a place where we can really seize that opportunity is super exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs will at least retain shortstop Dansby Swanson, whose seven-year deal runs through 2029, and third baseman Alex Bregman, who signed a five-year deal this offseason, offering veteran leadership past this season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Cubs could lose three important pieces to their lineup. Suzuki provides a power threat near the top of the order. Switch-hitting Happ’s knack for getting on base makes him a steadying presence, regardless of whether he’s on a hot or cool streak. Hoerner’s contact ability and clutch performance play whether he’s leading off or hitting in the bottom half of the lineup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoerner could hit the free agent market as a shortstop, a premium position that comes with higher earning potential. Happ should benefit from a thin outfield class. And Suzuki’s bat will be seen as an asset, whether teams evaluate him as a long-term outfielder or designated hitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happ and Suzuki both expressed an openness to extension negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to work hard and perform well,” Suzuki said through interpreter Edwin Stanberry, “and hopefully they say, yes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as extension candidates go, pitching tends to be more volatile, which will factor in as the Cubs decide whether to jump the market. This past winter, for example, they chose not to pick up left-hander Shota Imanaga’s three-year team option. A good season with an uptick in velocity could at least alter the calculation as Imanaga plays out his one-year qualifying offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left-hander Matthew Boyd ($15 million mutual option for 2027) and Taillon could also hit free agency after this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do have three free-agent starters, but I think that's something that we'll continue to discuss throughout the spring and throughout the season,” Hoyer said. “But I think having that next wave take a step forward will be really helpful, and something that's a big priority.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs, however, aren’t in position to fill all three spots with only internal options — unless they’re comfortable with their rotation taking a step back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catcher Carson Kelly, 31, also has a mutual option ($7.5 million) for 2027. And per usual, the Cubs’ bullpen is stacked with players on short-term contracts, necessitating the Cubs’ normal offseason restocking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every player's got a situation,” manager Craig Counsell said. “And, frankly, if you're at the point where you're in a free agent year, you're doing pretty good, things have gone pretty well for you. So, it's this team. It's now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, title=Latest on the Cubs, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, pagination=[{body=[Next Page], href=?p=2, _template=/link/Link.hbs, contentId=null, pianoSectionSlug=null, target=null}], buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, count=13708, carouselAutoPlay=false, items=[{type=Image, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, timestamp=1771468564000, publishDate=February 18, 2026 08:36 PM, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, isFeatured=false, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/18/cubs-kevin-alcantara-is-competing-for-an-opening-day-roster-spot-finally-pain-free-after-offseason-surgery, anchorId=promo-cc0000, target=null, primaryMediaType=null, category=[{items=[Cubs]}], wordCount=534, ampLink=null, media=[{image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/97/00/9436d888400ba2fcc437f178d584/st26-alcantara-01-f16.jpg, width=4200, height=2800}, alt=ST26-alcantara-01-f16.jpg, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/97/00/9436d888400ba2fcc437f178d584/st26-alcantara-01-f16.jpg, width=4200, height=2800}}], description=[{items=[Alcantara said the sports hernia had been bothering him since last February.]}], authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/maddie-lee, jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Cubs reporter]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[], name=[{items=[Maddie Lee]}], media=[]}], audio=[], audioDuration=null, title=Cubs&amp;#x27; Kevin Alcantara is competing for Opening Day roster spot, finally pain-free after offseason surgery, _template=/page/promo/PagePromo.hbs}, {type=Image, wordCount=612, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, title=MLB Players Association bracing for lockout before 2027 season: &amp;#x27;All but guaranteed&amp;#x27;, _styledTemplate=null, category=[{items=[Cubs]}], imageAlignment=null, isFeatured=false, publishDate=February 18, 2026 07:23 PM, anchorId=promo-cc0001, target=null, primaryMediaType=null, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/maddie-lee, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[], jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Cubs reporter]}], media=[], name=[{items=[Maddie Lee]}]}], url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/18/mlb-players-association-bracing-for-lockout-before-2027-season-all-but-guaranteed-bruce-meyer-executive-director, ampLink=null, audio=[], media=[{image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/c3/5a/7e37377944c580e190c2e8ea401e/union-shakeup-baseball.jpg, width=5760, height=3840}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/c3/5a/7e37377944c580e190c2e8ea401e/union-shakeup-baseball.jpg, width=5760, height=3840}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=Bruce Meyer}], description=[{items=[MLBPA leadership visited Cubs camp on Wednesday.]}], audioDuration=null, timestamp=1771464180000, _template=/page/promo/PagePromo.hbs}, {type=Image, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, timestamp=1771374188000, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/maddie-lee, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, name=[{items=[Maddie Lee]}], _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[], media=[], jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Cubs reporter]}]}], wordCount=673, _styledTemplate=null, description=[{items=[Suzuki is set to represent Japan in the World Baseball Classic, where he’ll play center field.

Madigan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the utility executive still sensed the moral danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He knew that pleasing a powerful politician by hiring his allies&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for do-nothing jobs was wrong, a prosecutor said Thursday. So when the FBI gave Marquez the opportunity to put things right in January 2019, he took it — and wore a wire &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/3/30/23663522/key-federal-witness-comed-bribery-trial-pays-a-price-defense-grills-his-decision-his-personal-life\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;against his friends and colleagues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/madigan-trial-news/mike-madigan-guilty-verdict\"   &gt;Once a political giant, Madigan now a convicted felon and likely prison inmate — but not a racketeer&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That decision also spared him any prison time. U.S. District Judge Mary Rowland agreed Thursday to give Marquez only two years of probation and a&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;$50,000 fine for his role in the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first, she made one thing clear: “We need people like you to stand up sooner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can’t have ComEd stand up to this stuff, we are sunk,” Rowland said. “We’re in real trouble if we don’t have powerful entities saying ‘enough’ to unreasonable, corrupt politicians.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The low-key, 75-minute sentencing of Marquez seemed to finally close the book — in the lower courts, anyway — on the blockbuster corruption investigation that upended Chicago politics and led to prison sentences &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/06/13/mike-madigan-sentencing-hearing\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;for Madigan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024/06/24/ed-burke-trial-alderman-edward-m-burke-news-verdict-sentence-final\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;ex-Chicago Ald. Edward M. Burke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was little suspense, though, as prosecutors had agreed in 2020 to seek probation if Marquez continued his cooperation. The main point of contention in Thursday’s hearing revolved around whether Marquez should pay a fine as high as $250,000, and whether he should be ordered to perform 320 hours of community service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, Rowland ordered Marquez to pay a fraction of the fine sought by prosecutors. She also spared him any court-ordered community service. Christopher Niewoehner, his defense attorney, said Marquez already spent “at least” 336 hours in 2025 helping students at Pima Community College in Arizona, where he lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-9d0000\" name=\"image-9d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/83ad2fb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4315x2422+0+228/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2Fba%2Ffeb8da074321b14665c95a8e63c8%2Fmarquezsentencing-260220-001.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e75658c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4315x2422+0+228/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2Fba%2Ffeb8da074321b14665c95a8e63c8%2Fmarquezsentencing-260220-001.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72f0a30/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4315x2422+0+228/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2Fba%2Ffeb8da074321b14665c95a8e63c8%2Fmarquezsentencing-260220-001.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"MARQUEZSENTENCING_260220-001.JPG\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72f0a30/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4315x2422+0+228/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2Fba%2Ffeb8da074321b14665c95a8e63c8%2Fmarquezsentencing-260220-001.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/615143d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4315x2422+0+228/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2Fba%2Ffeb8da074321b14665c95a8e63c8%2Fmarquezsentencing-260220-001.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72f0a30/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4315x2422+0+228/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2Fba%2Ffeb8da074321b14665c95a8e63c8%2Fmarquezsentencing-260220-001.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fidel Marquez at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse for sentencing on Feb. 19, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers / Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the light sentence came after Marquez testified in two trials against five people who now sit in federal prison: Madigan, former ComEd lobbyists &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-corruption-trials/2025/07/24/madigans-political-fixer-gets-2-year-prison-sentence\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Michael McClain&lt;/a&gt;

The former Chicago City Council member — who wore a wire against Madigan, Burke and others — struck a deal that helped him avoid even a criminal conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while Solis has &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2022/4/21/23036288/danny-solis-deal-cooperation-truly-extraordinary-bribery-charge\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;previously been described&lt;/a&gt; as one of Chicago’s “most significant cooperators in the last several decades,” prosecutors on Thursday heaped praise upon Marquez for his role in ending the ComEd conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Chapman even suggested Marquez, who rose to become ComEd’s senior vice president of governmental affairs, deserved to be known as a “super cooperator.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is simply difficult to describe in words how important and powerful that cooperation was,” Chapman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Niewoehner, a former federal prosecutor, compared Marquez to influence peddler Stuart Levine, a crucial cooperator caught up in the investigation that snared ex-Gov. Rod Blagojevich more than a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think when you sentence Mr. Marquez, he truly is the most extraordinary cooperator in the living memory, I think, of the U.S. attorney’s office,” Niewoehner told the judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/madigan-trial-news/2024/11/05/former-comed-exec-wore-wire-takes-stand-michael-madigan-trial\"   &gt;Key witness testifies ComEd funneled more than $600,000 to Madigan allies to get bills passed&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When the FBI confronted Marquez at his mother’s home in Hammond, Indiana, on Jan. 16, 2019, he “made an immediate decision to help because he thought it was the right thing to do,” Niewoehner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a chance for him to stop something he thought was wrong,” the attorney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marquez gathered much of the feds’ most crucial evidence without the assistance of a lawyer, Niewoehner wrote in a recent court memo.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The attorney said Marquez didn’t find counsel until after May 2019, once he’d secretly recorded McClain, Pramaggiore, Hooker and Doherty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marquez testified during Madigan’s trial that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/madigan-trial-news/2024/11/05/former-comed-exec-wore-wire-takes-stand-michael-madigan-trial\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;ComEd funneled cash to Madigan’s allies&lt;/a&gt; over several years as a “favor” so that Madigan would be “more positively disposed toward ComEd’s legislative agenda.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madigan’s trial ended in February 2025, with jurors agreeing that the former speaker conspired to have ComEd officials pay $1.3 million to his allies as part of the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McClain, Pramaggiore, Hooker and Doherty &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/5/2/23697452/jurors-reach-verdict-in-comed-bribery-trial\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;were convicted by a separate jury&lt;/a&gt; in May 2023 for their roles in the plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge John Blakey sentenced Madigan last summer to 7 ½ years in prison. The once-powerful Democrat is serving his sentence in West Virginia. However, he’s challenging his conviction, and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is set to hear arguments in his case April 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Manish Shah gave McClain and Pramaggiore two-year prison sentences. He gave Hooker 18 months and Doherty one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McClain and Pramaggiore are also pursuing an appeal, and arguments in their case are set for April 14.&lt;/p&gt;",

As you can see, all of our children love to participate in it.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lunar New Year, which began on Tuesday, is a centuries-old tradition that marks the end of winter and the start of a new year with a new moon. Year of the Horse celebrations will last 15-days — until March 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preparations for Thursday's performance started months ago. Students from pre-kindergarten to eighth grade worked with music teachers and choreographers to bring the event to life. Oi said she watched as students grew more confident with their routines as they rehearsed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If you saw them in August, they do not want anything to do with that stage,\" Oi said. \"But now, they're just, like, little stage lovers.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the the drums fell silent in the gymnasium, student voices picked up in excitement, ready for what was to come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An orange dragon began circling around the perimeter of the space. Students operating the dragon strategically paced their steps to make the puppet look like was alive. Students danced around the stage holding red silk fans that symbolized wishes for prosperity, health and success in the coming year. Early learners — as young as three and four-years-old — performed the Bianpao dance with firecrackers to bring good luck and drive away bad fortune. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"

dance alongside his classmates. Lin and his classmates wore traditional red garments and danced around the stage in a choreographed routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lin said he was \"very excited\" to dance with his class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a whole school effort, said Joe Delfin, the school's music teacher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Fortunately, our students are professionals,\" Delfin said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delfin said he has watched alumni, who used to be performers in the annual celebration, return to the show with their kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"They're starting their own traditions,\" he said. \"We hope that these students will really appreciate their culture and share it with their neighbors, friends and their families as well.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
