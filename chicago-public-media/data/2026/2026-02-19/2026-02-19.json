After prayer, worshippers went downstairs where long tables were set for a communal meal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They came together with a renewed focus on safety, turning to one another for support amid heightened immigration enforcement across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"A lot of us are children of immigrants, or [are] immigrants,\" said Rana Jaber, a board member at the center. \"We let our community know that this is a safe space for them.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help ensure that safety, Jaber said the Downtown Islamic Center increased their security measures and education in recent months to ensure people can gather to pray safely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramadan, which began on Tuesday evening in the United States, is observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting from sunrise to sunset, prayer and spiritual reflection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The whole exercise [of Ramadan] is like a boot camp of turning back to God, re-centering yourself, remembering your purpose, your mission,\" said Abrar Omeish, 31. \"It's turning back to remember who's in control.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as worshippers at the center focused on spiritual renewal, Omeish said many are also navigating uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located near DePaul University's downtown Loop campus, the center draws international students from local universities, families and newcomers to Chicago looking for community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omeish said that renewed immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump has impacted members of the community, as many come from immigrant backgrounds. Still, she said, Ramadan offers a reminder to remain grounded and steadfast in their faith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's about finding the goodness in whatever is to come — whether ...  you live the rest of your life here, or maybe are forced out of this country,\" she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, \"We come together as a community to remind ourselves of that, and to remind ourselves to stay grounded in what ultimately matters.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

I’m continuing to build up for the first game. … I'm feeling strong right now, but I need to continue working on that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcántara is competing for the fourth outfielder spot this spring, with Justin Dean and non-roster invitees Dylan Carlson and Chas McCormick also vying to make the Opening Day roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm here for the team,” Alcántara said he told manager Craig Counsell. “Whatever opportunity you bring me, I want to … do my best. I feel so happy with that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcántara was on the cusp of making the Tokyo Series roster last year,&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/03/11/cubs-set-tokyo-series-travel-roster-matt-shaw-expected-to-debut-in-japan\"   &gt; left off in favor of third baseman Matt Shaw&lt;/a&gt;. This year, Alcántara has the advantage of being pain-free, and having last year to point to as proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kevin did a heck of a job last September,” Counsell said this week. “There was not a lot of playing time, it was super sporadic. I thought his preparation was great. In the clubhouse, he was great. When he got chances, executed what we wanted him to do. And I thought that was really important. And he had success. It was a successful month.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcántara didn’t get many chances. In his 10 appearances, he only had 11 at-bats. But he recorded four hits, an RBI and a stolen base. Then when it was time for the Cubs to select their playoff roster, they included him for both rounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That tells you what happened that last month,” Counsell said. “And now it's just, you’ve got to continue to get better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The issue is, when you put a good team together, it gets harder to make that team. It gets harder to find at-bats, find plate appearances. He's young. When the runway for opportunity comes, that's not quite clear yet. But I also think Kevin showed that he could, in a part time role, be a contributor. And certainly take note of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year in Triple-A, Alcántara had a streaky season. He finished with just a .266 batting average, while hitting a career-high 17 home runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did so while playing through pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's a nagging injury that you can play with but just is uncomfortable,” Counsell said. “... It doesn't take you off the field, but from a running perspective, explosiveness perspective, from a ‘how many swings do I have in me today’ preparation perspective, all those things, that's very real.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcántara is looking forward to showing what he can do without those limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope I’m healthy every year,” he said, “and continue to play a lot of games and help the team.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The Cubs announced their minor-league coaching staff Wednesday. Changes include new managers for High-A South Bend and the Arizona Complex League. In South Bend, Daniel Wasinger was promoted from bench coach. And former major-league infielder Dixon Machado, who also spent stints in the Cubs’ farm system, will be at the helm in the ACL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Counsell announced Wednesday that right-hander Jameson Taillon is set to start the Cubs’ Cactus League opener Friday against the White Sox at Sloan Park. Left-hander Matthew Boyd is penciled in for Saturday’s home game against the Rangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, title=Latest on the Cubs, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, count=13708, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, pageCount=4570, carouselSpeed=null, buttonHoverBgColor=#a91d23, rteHeadingFont=font-1, secondaryColor=#656565, hideCategories=true, _template=/page/list/includes/PageList-header.hbs, font3=Arial, font4=Source-serif-4, ctaUrl=null, hideImage=false, footerLinkHoverColor=#d3242c, _styledTemplate=/page/list/PageListE.hbs, hideAudioPlayback=false, description=[], listColumns234=null, showSecondItemMedia=false, footerTextColor=#ffffff, hideDescriptions=true, headerSecondaryBgColor=#000000, primaryTextColorInverse=#ffffff, titleColor=null, ampLink=null, listHeaderPosition=null, showActionBar=true, linkHoverColor=#d3242c, buttonBgColor=#d3242c, ctaTarget=null, suppressPagination=false, promoButtonText=null, backgroundColor=null, headerSecondaryTextColor=#ffffff, anchorId=list-c90005, listTitleFont=font-2, headlineFont=font-1, promoDescriptionFont=font-3, primaryColor=#d3242c, pullQuoteIcon=[{image=null, narrowImage=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=null}], slimFooter=false, hideHeadline=false, hideDates=true, headerBorderColor=#e9e9e9, pagination=[{body=[Next Page], href=?p=2, _template=/link/Link.hbs, contentId=null, pianoSectionSlug=null, target=null}], items=[{type=Image, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, media=[{image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/c3/5a/7e37377944c580e190c2e8ea401e/union-shakeup-baseball.jpg, width=5760, height=3840}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/c3/5a/7e37377944c580e190c2e8ea401e/union-shakeup-baseball.jpg, width=5760, height=3840}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=Bruce Meyer}], title=MLB Players Association bracing for lockout before 2027 season: &amp;#x27;All but guaranteed&amp;#x27;, category=[{items=[Cubs]}], _styledTemplate=null, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/maddie-lee, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[], media=[], jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Cubs reporter]}], name=[{items=[Maddie Lee]}]}], imageAlignment=null, isFeatured=false, wordCount=653, publishDate=February 18, 2026 07:23 PM, description=[{items=[MLBPA leadership visited Cubs camp on Wednesday.]}], target=null, primaryMediaType=null, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/18/mlb-players-association-bracing-for-lockout-before-2027-season-all-but-guaranteed-bruce-meyer-executive-director, ampLink=null, anchorId=promo-790000, audio=[], audioDuration=null, timestamp=1771464180000, _template=/page/promo/PagePromo.hbs}, {type=Image, title=MLBPA names Bruce Meyer interim executive director, description=[{items=[The decisions by the Major League Baseball Players Association executive board during an online meeting was a move for continuity ahead of the likely start in April of what figures to be contentious collective bargaining.]}], publishDate=February 18, 2026 07:10 PM, wordCount=257, _styledTemplate=null, media=[{narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/fc/34/bb0b180b48c99d36df69c9d02760/ap21336638856377.jpg, width=5670, height=3780}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/fc/34/bb0b180b48c99d36df69c9d02760/ap21336638856377.jpg, width=5670, height=3780}, alt=Bruce Meyer}], imageAlignment=null, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb, isFeatured=false, timestamp=1771463423000, target=null, primaryMediaType=null, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/associated-press, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, bio=[{items=[The Associated Press is an independent, not-for-profit news cooperative headquartered in New York City.

The four migrants appeared to be recently detained, clergy members said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You saw the crying eyes, confusion, uncertainty,” said Father Leandro Fossá, pastor for Our Lady of Mount Carmel in Melrose Park. “You could also see they were responsive, so they felt the hope of the moment they could see the church was there with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What clergy members found inside the facility was a far cry from what it would have been last year during the Trump administration's immigration blitz. The windows were still boarded up and a fence and other barriers still kept protesters and the public at bay, but the building was empty when they arrived, they said. Just four detainees arrived while they were there, a striking difference from reports last fall of the building being crowded with people and little room to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Religious immigrant advocates, including the late Sisters Pat Murphy and JoAnn Persch, used to regularly visit with immigrants detained at the Broadview facility until the COVID-19 pandemic pushed visits online in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after faith leaders were &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/01/religious-leaders-request-to-give-communion-to-detainees-at-broadview-facility-is-denied-again\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;denied access&lt;/a&gt; this fall as the Trump administration upped its immigration enforcement in the area, some clergy members &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/19/clergy-sue-ice-over-restriction-on-providing-religious-services-to-detainees-intimidation-of-religious\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;sued the federal government&lt;/a&gt;. The Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership, a plaintiff in the case, accused the government of violating federal law and First Amendment rights of religious leaders and detainees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to continue to do what we were able to do for so many years and suddenly stopped with the change in direction here,” said Sister Jeremy Midura, a Felician sister and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. “Sister Pat and Sister JoAnn were able to go into the facility. All that changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clergy members said the facility appeared clean, despite reports of squalid conditions inside the building last fall, and immigration agents were accommodating. They said they intend to schedule more visits to the facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cupich praises injunction that allowed clergy into ICE facility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardinal Blase Cupich, Archbishop of Chicago, praised the federal judge's injunction that allowed clergy into the ICE facility.

Homegoing services are scheduled for 10 a.m. Saturday, Feb. 28, at Rainbow PUSH. Doors open at 9 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relatives of Jackson said that \"all are welcome,\" regardless of political party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Do not bring your politics, out of respect to Rev. Jesse Jackson and the life that he lived, to these homegoing services. They come respectful and come to say thank you,\" Jesse Jackson Jr. said during a media event in front of the Jackson family home. \"But these homegoing services are welcome to all — Democrat, Republican, liberal and conservative, right wing, left wing, because his life is broad enough to cover the full spectrum of what it means to be an American.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarded as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s protege, Jackson worked tirelessly throughout the Civil Rights Movement and after to champion for the rights of Black people. He started the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the famed Chicago-based multiracial nonprofit, in 1970, and it continues to fight for social change, economic equality and civil rights. In the 1980s, Jackson ran the first viable presidential campaign by a Black candidate in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of his death, leaders around the world and Chicago residents have shared messages of support for the family, remembering Jackson for his years of activism while mourning his loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How did he die?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the family has not given an official cause of death or said where he died, Jackson had been declining in health for a decade before his death. In 2015,&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2017/11/17/18375473/rev-jesse-jackson-announces-parkinson-s-diagnosis\"   &gt; Jackson was initially diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, but he revealed last April that it was actually progressive supranuclear palsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How is the political world reacting to his death?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political figures from across the country have weighed in to pay their respects and honor his legacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement, former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama wrote: \"Michelle and I will always be grateful for Jesse's lifetime of service, and the friendship our families share. We stood on his shoulders. We send our deepest condolences to the Jackson family and everyone in Chicago and beyond who knew and loved him.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump also extended his sympathies to Jackson's family in a statement posted to Truth Social Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I knew him well, long before becoming President,\" he said. \"He was very gregarious — Someone who truly loved people! Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago leaders, including Mayor Brandon Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker, also shared their condolences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"In honor of Rev. Jackson's service, and as our city mourns, the Chicago flag will lower to half-staff,\" Mayor Johnson wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker also ordered all flags across the state to fly at half-mast to honor him in a statement posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He broke down barriers, inspired generations, and kept hope alive. Our state, nation, and world are better due to his years of service,\" Pritzker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How are Chicago residents reacting to his death?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the city, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2026/02/17/jesse-jackson-chicago-remembers\"   &gt;Chicago residents mourned Jackson’s death&lt;/a&gt; and urged that his legacy continue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Travis, a congregant of Apostolic Church of God in Woodlawn, said in his youth, his parents brought him to demonstrations organized by Operation Breadbasket, a group Jackson led. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, 64, Travis remembers Jackson as \"instrumental in fighting for justice and freedom for all people.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chloe Gould, 41, a Bronzeville resident, said that his death still hit \"like you lost a family member.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of his death, she said she worries about the future of civil rights activism, as activists and leaders have not stepped in to fill his shoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Who is gonna be the civil rights activist now?\" she asked. &lt;/p&gt;",

Dr. Martin Luther King than Rev. Jesse Lewis Jackson,” said Santita Jackson, Jesse Jackson’s eldest daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Jackson died peacefully early Tuesday morning surrounded by his family, who said they will honor his life by carrying forward his commitment to justice and equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reverend had been in declining health for more than a decade. In 2017, he announced he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease two years earlier, but last April he revealed the diagnosis was actually progressive supranuclear palsy, a condition that also affects bodily movement. He was also hospitalized just months before he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in his final moments, Jackson’s children said their father never spoke about his pain and continued to “bounce back,” driven by his lifelong devotion to helping others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yusef Jackson said what kept his father going “was not his desire for more life, but his desire for more service.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His family said they reassured Jesse Jackson before he died that they would “continue his work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Each of my siblings and my mother, we wanted to give him comfort that it was going to be all right, that he has taught us enough to continue his work,” said Yusef Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yusef Jackson said he would be taking the reins of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the famed Chicago-based multiracial nonprofit Jesse Jackson started in 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Jackson never held public office, but in the 1980s, he ran the first viable presidential campaign by a Black candidate. His son, U.S. Rep. Jonathan Jackson, said he would use his congressional seat to continue to fight for equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That's our calling, that's our mission, and that's what we're going to fight for,” said Jonathan Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funeral services for Jesse Jackson are expected to begin next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reverend’s eldest son, Jesse Jackson Jr., said the services will welcome all, regardless of political party, but urged attendees to “not bring your politics out of respect” to his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His life is broad enough to cover the full spectrum of what it means to be an American,” said Jesse Jackson Jr. “We only ask people to come and be respectful.”&lt;/p&gt;",

Their strategy in bargaining has always been to put as much pressure on the players as they can to try and create divisions and cracks among our membership. It's never worked. I don't think it ever will work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meyer, previously the deputy executive director, was at Cubs camp to meet with the players as part of the union’s annual spring training circuit.&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/17/cubs-react-to-tony-clark-resigning-as-mlbpa-executive-director-the-strength-of-the-union-is-in-the-players\"   &gt; Tony Clark’s resignation as executive director Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; pushed back the players association’s camp meeting schedule, but it picked back up Wednesday with the Royals and Cubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb/2026/02/18/mlbpa-names-bruce-meyer-interim-executive-director\"   &gt;MLBPA names Bruce Meyer interim executive director&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Our staff, we've worked for years with Tony,” Meyer said. “We all have feelings for him as a human being. It's been very hard for a lot of us, for a lot of reasons. We haven't gotten much sleep, and in my case, haven't eaten much either. We've been on the phone, as you can imagine, informing players, agents reaching out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it's fine. The union is strong, will remain strong. This is not going to affect collective bargaining in any way, really. And we’ve just got to make sure we put the players in the best position to understand what's going on, make whatever informed decisions they're going to make. And whatever that takes, we're committed to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLBPA leadership addressed Clark’s resignation in the meeting with Cubs players but also forged ahead, discussing expected bargaining topics, according to sources. Meyer declined to comment on specifics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ll say, they were both very good meetings,” Meyer said. “A lot of great questions and participation from the players. So, terrific meetings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meyer, who is expected to retain his role as the union's lead negotiator, is not the first person to suggest that a lockout could be coming. It was a tool the owners used last bargaining cycle. And the league has already floated the idea of a salary cap, which the players have long opposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are preparing for a concerted push on the other side for a salary cap,” Meyer said. “And we're ready for it, and our players are ready for it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MLB commissioner Rob Manfred, for his part, has downplayed the likelihood of a lockout that would impact the 2027 season. When asked in August what the contingency plan would be for the 2027 All-Star Game at Wrigley Field in the case of a work stoppage, he said: “My contingency plan is to make an agreement with the players and play the ‘27 season. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/16/cubs-chairman-tom-ricketts-on-potential-mlb-broadcast-consolidation-we-love-our-independence\"   &gt;Cubs chairman Tom Ricketts&lt;/a&gt; this spring declined to weigh in on specific bargaining topics, saying he’d leave those decisions up to the league. But he said his advice to fans following the posturing on both sides would be: “Enjoy the season. Enjoy the games as we have them. Obviously it's the last year of the collective bargaining agreement. Both the league and the players association want to make some improvements from their perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time the owners and players sat down at a bargaining table to hammer out a CBA, the sport went through a 99-day lockout before the sides ratified an agreement. It came just in time to salvage the full season, with opening day pushed back about a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are ready, willing and able to negotiate whenever and wherever they are ready to do that,” Meyer said Wednesday. “And if we can get an early deal and avoid the negative effects of a lockout — which is their decision — coming off a great season of baseball, great playoffs — if we can get a fair deal that avoids that, we will make every effort to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, title=Latest on the Cubs, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, pullQuoteIcon=[{image=null, narrowImage=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=null}], relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, items=[{type=Image, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, title=MLB Players Association bracing for lockout before 2027 season: &amp;#x27;All but guaranteed&amp;#x27;, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, category=[{items=[Cubs]}], isFeatured=false, media=[{image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/c3/5a/7e37377944c580e190c2e8ea401e/union-shakeup-baseball.jpg, width=5760, height=3840}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/c3/5a/7e37377944c580e190c2e8ea401e/union-shakeup-baseball.jpg, width=5760, height=3840}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=Bruce Meyer}], wordCount=653, publishDate=February 18, 2026 07:23 PM, description=[{items=[MLBPA leadership visited Cubs camp on Wednesday.]}], target=null, primaryMediaType=null, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/18/mlb-players-association-bracing-for-lockout-before-2027-season-all-but-guaranteed-bruce-meyer-executive-director, ampLink=null, anchorId=promo-790000, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/maddie-lee, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[], media=[], name=[{items=[Maddie Lee]}], jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Cubs reporter]}]}], audio=[], audioDuration=null, timestamp=1771464180000, _template=/page/promo/PagePromo.hbs}, {media=[{narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/fc/34/bb0b180b48c99d36df69c9d02760/ap21336638856377.jpg, width=5670, height=3780}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/fc/34/bb0b180b48c99d36df69c9d02760/ap21336638856377.jpg, width=5670, height=3780}, alt=Bruce Meyer}], type=Image, title=MLBPA names Bruce Meyer interim executive director, publishDate=February 18, 2026 07:10 PM, category=[{items=[MLB]}], wordCount=257, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb, isFeatured=false, timestamp=1771463423000, target=null, primaryMediaType=null, description=[{items=[The decisions by the Major League Baseball Players Association executive board during an online meeting was a move for continuity ahead of the likely start in April of what figures to be contentious collective bargaining.]}], url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb/2026/02/18/mlbpa-names-bruce-meyer-interim-executive-director, ampLink=null, anchorId=promo-790001, audio=[], audioDuration=null, _template=/page/promo/PagePromo.hbs, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/associated-press, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, bio=[{items=[The Associated Press is an independent, not-for-profit news cooperative headquartered in New York City.

Plymouth Court. The 0.35-acre site includes a city-owned parking structure that will be demolished, as well as three parcels of vacant land. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leon Walker, CEO and founder of DL3 Realty, said it's a site that’s been neglected for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think this is a diamond in the rough that needs to be lifted up and polished off so that people could really appreciate the opportunity we present here,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acoda will have 300 apartments, with 20% affordable, according to the city’s Department of Planning and Development. There will also be ground-floor retail and restaurant space, a co-working space, live-work lofts and 60 parking spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project, designed by architecture firm Perkins &amp;amp; Will, is eligible for up to $5 million in grant funding from the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"As we continue to confront the housing shortage head-on, I'm thrilled the city is supporting this 300-unit project that includes 60 much-needed affordable homes for the Loop,\" Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a news release. \"The investment will empower people from all walks of life to live in the beating heart of our city, extending job opportunities as well as access to public transit and Chicago's numerous cultural and community amenities.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a60000\" name=\"image-a60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0413269/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1227x689+0+459/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2F0b%2F7fafdab149e3864a872065b97045%2F331-s-plymouth-image2.jpeg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1fe15b5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1227x689+0+459/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2F0b%2F7fafdab149e3864a872065b97045%2F331-s-plymouth-image2.jpeg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e7a5a51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1227x689+0+459/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2F0b%2F7fafdab149e3864a872065b97045%2F331-s-plymouth-image2.jpeg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Rendering of DL3 Realty&amp;#x27;s 25-story high-rise Acoda\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e7a5a51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1227x689+0+459/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2F0b%2F7fafdab149e3864a872065b97045%2F331-s-plymouth-image2.jpeg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53a3cbd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1227x689+0+459/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2F0b%2F7fafdab149e3864a872065b97045%2F331-s-plymouth-image2.jpeg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e7a5a51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1227x689+0+459/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2F0b%2F7fafdab149e3864a872065b97045%2F331-s-plymouth-image2.jpeg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rendering of DL3 Realty’s 25-story high-rise, Acoda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of the Chicago Department of Planning and Development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;DL3 Realty is also committing at least $1.5 million to upgrade the adjacent Pritzker Park, at Van Buren and State streets. Improvements will include a performance space, improved lighting and public art, according to the planning department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the same block, at 22 W. Van Buren St., was a building used as &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2020/6/21/21296462/blues-brothers-film-flophouse-hotel-chicago-downtown-l-train-movies-plymouth-hotel\"   &gt;Elwood Blues’ apartment&lt;/a&gt; in the movie \"The Blues Brothers,\" which was filmed in and around Chicago. But that portion of the block was demolished in 1990, according to the planning department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walker said he thinks Acoda is a great opportunity for a live, work and play environment, especially as buildings Downtown &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/04/25/office-residential-conversions-apartments-housing-downtown\"   &gt;continue to be converted&lt;/a&gt; for other uses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The property's live-work units will be like duplexes: The first floor will have space for tenants to work and host meetings, while the second floor will serve as the private living quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We find that to be incredibly attractive to emerging entrepreneurs and others who just can't afford to pay two rents while they're getting their business off the ground,” Walker said. “Every time we put live-works out, we have a waiting list for those that want to rent those units.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acoda will complement the city’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2024/04/03/mayor-johnson-proposing-150m-tif-assistance-lasalle-street-revamp\"   &gt;LaSalle Corridor Revitalization&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative to convert office buildings into apartments, with many of them affordable. DL3 is part of the development team overhauling the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/architecture-design/2025/07/09/landmarks-commission-lasalle-street-art-deco-field-building-skyscraper\"   &gt;Field Building&lt;/a&gt;, which will create 386 new apartments, in addition to retail space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Plymouth Court project is one of a few opportunities in the Loop for new, ground-up construction, Walker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Downtown has slumped and gone through its changes after COVID in terms of how we work and live,” Walker said. “There's a great opportunity to make this a live, work, learn and play environment, but we need new buildings and new product to make that happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site’s zoning hasn’t been determined and could require a planned development designation, according to planning department Deputy Commissioner Peter Strazzabosco. The land sale will include a redevelopment agreement requiring the City Council's approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The planning department said the proposed $3.8 million purchase price is the site’s market value. The sale hasn’t closed yet, but Walker said the firm is aiming to break ground in 2027, with construction taking about 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;",

The deal barely avoided what would have been the first loss of regular-season games since 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meyer spent 30 years at Weil, Gotshal &amp;amp; Manges before joining the NHL Players Association in 2016 as senior director of collective bargaining, policy and legal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three members of the union's eight-man executive subcommittee, Jack Flaherty, Lucas Giolito and Ian Happ, were among the players who in March 2024 advocated for the ouster of Meyer in an effort led by former union lawyer Harry Marino. Clark backed Meyer, the effort failed and those three players were dropped off the subcommittee that December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subcommittee voted 8-0 against approving the 2022 labor contract and Meyer had advocated pushing management for a deal more favorable to the union. Team player representatives, the overall group supervising negotiations, voted 26-4 in favor, leaving the overall ballot at 26-12 for ratification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current subcommittee includes Chris Bassitt, Jake Cronenworth, Pete Fairbanks, Cedric Mullins, Marcus Semien, Paul Skenes, Tarik Skubal and Brent Suter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Loomis St. in Little Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Park District selected Cabrini after whittling down 157 nominated figures to eight candidates. In a public vote, nearly 1,500 of the 3,900 votes were cast for Cabrini. Other nominations included Renato Dulbecco, Enrico Fermi, Phillip Mazzei, Maria Montessori, Florence Scala, Antonin Scalia and Amerigo Vespucci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artists interested in creating the sculpture can submit an application &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/dcase_opportunities.html.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;online starting March 1&lt;/a&gt;. Upon completion, the statue will be owned by the City of Chicago and displayed in the seven-acre park on the Near West Side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cabrini was an Italian-born missionary nun who founded the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, through which she helped build dozens of schools, hospitals and orphanages across the Americas and Europe. She is half of the namesake of the Cabrini-Green homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e20000\" name=\"image-e20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/489b96d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5353x3004+0+282/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff0%2F79%2Facb494d053fd12204b61f4990e25%2Fcolumbus-statue.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c28f76c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5353x3004+0+282/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff0%2F79%2Facb494d053fd12204b61f4990e25%2Fcolumbus-statue.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/245dadd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5353x3004+0+282/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff0%2F79%2Facb494d053fd12204b61f4990e25%2Fcolumbus-statue.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A poster of Italian Americans stands, surrounded by Italian and American flags, in the spot where a statue of Christopher Columbus once stood in Arrigo Park in Little Italy.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/245dadd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5353x3004+0+282/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff0%2F79%2Facb494d053fd12204b61f4990e25%2Fcolumbus-statue.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/026a5a7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5353x3004+0+282/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff0%2F79%2Facb494d053fd12204b61f4990e25%2Fcolumbus-statue.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/245dadd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5353x3004+0+282/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff0%2F79%2Facb494d053fd12204b61f4990e25%2Fcolumbus-statue.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A poster, which was set up by the Joint Civic Committee of Italian Americans, is displayed at Arrigo Park in the Little Italy neighborhood in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times (file)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was made the patron saint of immigrants in 1950, four years after more than 100,000 people attended a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/11/11/18471565/at-the-shrine-of-first-u-s-saint-who-came-to-america-as-an-immigrant\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;celebratory mass at Soldier Field&lt;/a&gt; for her receiving sainthood.

Her work reflects Chicago at its best: a city that rises by lifting others. This monument at Arrigo Park will honor her enduring legacy and all of the communities who continue to shape our city.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Mayor Lori Lightfoot &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2020/7/27/21340773/christopher-columbus-statues-grant-arrigo-park-removal-protests\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;removed the park’s Columbus statue&lt;/a&gt;, as well as two other Columbus statues in the city, in 2020 after they became targets of vandalism during the civic unrest following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Columbus statue in Arrigo Park has been loaned to the Joint Civic Committee of Italian Americans for display in an upcoming Chicago Museum of Italian Immigration on Taylor Street. The deal is part of a settlement between the group and the park district resolving &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2022/8/3/23290728/christopher-columbus-statues-chicago-grant-arrigo-park-protests-talian-american-lawsuit-lightfoot\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;a long-running lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; following the statue's removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last remnants of the Columbus statue were &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2025/07/24/columbus-statue-pedestal-removal-grant-park-rotating-art\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;removed from Grant Park in July&lt;/a&gt;, and were expected to be replaced by rotating art installations to “celebrate Chicago’s diverse communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mother Cabrini’s dedication to advancing equity, justice and inclusivity for the marginalized immigrant communities aligns with the Park District’s promise to make parks accessible to all,” Chicago Park District General Supt. and CEO Carlos Ramirez-Rosa said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;",

They say the action violates the separation of powers and the Administrative Procedure Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Illinois, six grant awards to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of Illinois-Chicago that are collectively worth over $20 million — which Raoul said are to “make the electricity grid more reliable and resilient, reduce carbon emissions, and utilize domestic sources of rare earth elements and critical minerals” — were on the chopping block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This unlawful attempt to block funding approved by Congress will seriously harm work being done in Illinois and across the nation to improve energy efficiency, strengthen energy resiliency and increase clean energy – all of which benefit the public,” Raoul said in a statement. “I will continue to stand with my fellow attorneys general to fight back against the president’s illegal actions that harm our communities and our environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Energy didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also signed on to the suit are the attorney generals of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raoul and other attorneys general have been mounting legal wins, the latest of which came a week ago when &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/health/2026/02/12/federal-judge-temporarily-blocks-trump-cuts-to-hiv-lead-poisoning-prevention-funds\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a federal judge temporarily blocked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration from cutting more than &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2026/02/10/trump-administration-cuts-illinois-hiv-prevention-grants\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;$600 million in public health grants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Illinois and three other Democratic-led states — just a day after Raoul joined a coalition of states in a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/health/2026/02/11/federal-cuts-hiv-lead-poisoning-prevention-grants-raoul\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;federal lawsuit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to challenge the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, in response to another suit from Raoul and other legal officials, a federal appeals court &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/health/2026/01/06/appeals-court-kwame-raoul-trump-administration-medical-research\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;ruled to restore medical research funding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cut by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Raoul was part of a large coalition of legal officials that won a suit for the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/09/24/illinois-wins-suit-on-disaster-relief-funding-held-by-dhs-over-sanctuary-laws\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;release of $2 billion in federal disaster relief funding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; held up by the White House over sanctuary city policies.

The school was called North Division when it knocked off Austin to win the championship in 1904. It was renamed Waller and then became Lincoln Park in the late 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This season, the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/02/15/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;No. 21 Lions&lt;/a&gt; are one of the most talented teams in the Public League but didn't live up to expectations early in the season. Lincoln Park even had a key player transfer to a prep school in late December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coach Josh Anderson, a former Simeon star and the son of former NBA player Nick Anderson, guided the team through the rough start and relished his team’s 52-43 win against No. 25 Hyde Park in the Public League playoff semifinals on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2026/02/18/chicago-illinois-high-school-basketball-scores\"   &gt;Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; at UIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hours in the gym, hours of film,” Anderson said. “They’ve built a bond. Every season they grew. We hung our hat on the work. When you are 16 and 17 it is about maturity. They have taken to the coaching and they have matured.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Ahmad Lee and senior forward Larry Harris lived up to their potential under the bright lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The losses we took this season were not because of the teams we were playing,” Harris said. “It was because of ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee, a fast and dynamic guard, finished with 17 points, six assists and four rebounds. Harris, an athletic leaper, added 17 points and seven rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their two best players were their two best players,” Hyde Park coach Jerrel Oliver said. “Everything we said we would try to stop, we didn’t stop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kye Ward-Owens scored with 4:28 left to pull the Thunderbirds within 39-34, but Lincoln Park (20-7) shot 11-for-14 from the free throw line in the fourth quarter to seal the win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was part of the growth and maturity, the hours of free throws,” Anderson said. “There were some days where we weren’t doing anything but free throws. Getting that footwork down. I am proud of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lions knocked off highly-regarded Peoria Richwoods last week and have played one of the most challenging schedules in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This feels great,” Lee said. “One more game. The Richwoods game helped us a lot. That big win was great for our chemistry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Jaylen Dickerson scored 12 points and had five assists for the Lions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We always had belief,” Dickerson said. “We just needed to mature and we did. We don’t really pay attention to the rankings. We don’t let that fog up our brain.
