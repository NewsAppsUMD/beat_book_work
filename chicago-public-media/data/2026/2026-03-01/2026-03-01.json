It's good to see that he's ready to go, and he's feeling good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But as far as for me, I don't think anything changes. That stuff's out of my control. We have such a deep staff that we got plenty of guys that can fill those roles. And like we're saying earlier, whatever Counce for us, we'll be ready.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele wrote on his post that Meister had told him to “start building up and get ready for games” after posting a video of his bullpen session Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs have yet to put Steele on the 60-day injured list, but that could be a formality if they need to clear space on the 40-man roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as for Rea, who made 27 starts for the Cubs in 2025, there’s plenty of work ahead - especially with his changeup - as he threw only 29 of 51 pitches for strikes and fell behind in counts often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think (the changeup) needs to get better (to left-handed batters),” Rea said. “I think my games last year, where I did well, and my changeup was a big part of those. Early in spring, it hasn't been good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pete Speak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pete Crow-Armstrong possesses a colorful language, that sometimes needs an explanation or even a translation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manager Craig Counsell said he sought answers after failing to understand his prized center fielder’s self-examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes, Pete says things that I have no idea what they mean, no idea what they mean,” Counsell said. “And even when he explains them, they have no idea what he means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But that's OK. I like that. I enjoy that. It actually makes me think a little bit, and a lot of players do that, so it's fun. I just think that's a very personal thing that I think we all hope that we get better at that as we just get older, no matter what you're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He said something yesterday. ‘I (said), Pete can you explain because I don't know what it means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hodge podge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porter Hodge continues to struggle with finding his control that helped him emerge as a standout reliever in 2024 when he posted an 0.884 WHIP to go with a 1.88 ERA in 39 appearances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to be in the strike zone more, flat out,” Counsell said of Hodge, who has walked seven in two innings covering three spring games. “I think we got walks in every outing, multiple walks in two of three.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cubs 6, Dodgers 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Brown pitched with plenty of conviction during two scoreless innings. The most encouraging aspect of Brown’s performance was that he didn’t walk a batter while using his knuckle curve effectively to complement his 97 mph fastball and struck out three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Christian Bethancourt, vying for a backup catching job, made his spring debut and made a favorable impression on starter Colin Rea. This marked the first time they worked together since their days with the Padres 10 years ago, and Rea appreciated that Bethancourt challenged him by mixing speeds early in counts and not allowing him to get into a pattern. Bethancourt will depart soon to play for Team Panama in the WBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Keep an eye on Kevin Alcantara. The Cubs’ top outfield prospect, also making his spring debut after undergoing hernia surgery, employed a new wider batting stance. Alcantara went 0-for-4 with two strikeouts but fouled off five pitches during a nine-pitch sequence in his first at-bat before flying to center. Alcantara, who has one minor league option left, said he will make a start in the outfield on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;b&gt;ON DECK:&lt;/b&gt; Cubs vs. White Sox, Sunday, 1:05 p.m., Mesa, Ariz.

His teammates, yet again, did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it was a similar story for the Hawks in their 3-1 loss to the Avalanche as in their &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/02/26/blackhawks-connor-bedard-fire-predators-nhl-power-play-quarterback\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;4-2 loss Thursday&lt;/a&gt; against the Predators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bedard has scored in both games and racked up eight shots on goal. Every other Hawk has combined for one goal and 30 shots over the two games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We've got to help him,\" captain Nick Foligno said Saturday. \"[It] can't just be on Connor. He's doing his job. He's getting scoring chances. He's making plays. He could have had five [goals] tonight. So it's on the rest of us to pick it up and find a way to help him out, give him some run support.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bedard's power-play snipe early in the first period held up for some time, but Cale Makar ultimately equalized for the Avalanche with eight seconds left in the second period, breaking through solid Hawks goalie Spencer Knight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gavin Brindley gave the hosts their first lead with 12:29 left and Makar added an empty-netter to improve the Avalanche's home record to a ridiculous 22-4-4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks, meanwhile, are now 4-10-2 over their last 16 games (dating back to Jan. 9), and they've scored only 31 goals during that span —&amp;nbsp;averaging less than two per game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bedard is undeniably doing his part since the Olympic break. In addition to the goal, he pushed through contact to get to the net more than usual Saturday, and he also got involved in skirmishes more than usual. The fire blazing underneath him isn't dying down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;GOAL: Connor Bedard with a SNIPE on the power play for his 25th goal of the season! &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/BL6eYGziBB\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BL6eYGziBB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; BHF (@BlackhawksFocus) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BlackhawksFocus/status/2027886601846542557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 28, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks at least had one other line going Saturday, which is more than they could claim Thursday. Coach Jeff Blashill united the veteran trio of Jason Dickinson, Ilya Mikheyev and Tyler Bertuzzi to \"tilt the ice\" against the NHL's top team, and they did just that. They were excellent in the first period especially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But second-line center Frank Nazar, despite faster movement in transition Saturday, continues to generate less production than the Hawks desperately need him to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth line has generated very little all season long. Depth forwards Foligno, Colton Dach and Landon Slaggert have seven goals combined, and Ryan Donato has also struggled whenever demoted to that role (as he was Saturday).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And first-line winger Andre Burakovsky, who clicked so seamlessly with Bedard early on this season, hasn't looked any better exiting the break than he did entering it — even though he continues to have an avid defender in Blashill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blashill mentioned how Burakovsky led the team in scoring-chance differential against the Predators (according to the Hawks' internal analytics). He stated Burakovsky will remain with Bedard on Sunday against the Mammoth as their road trip continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blashill did agree with the basic sentiment about needing more depth scoring, though. He maligned some mishandled pucks that negated potential odd-man rushes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things might've played out differently had Dickinson converted — rather than hit the crossbar on — a breakaway 20 seconds in, as well. But Avalanche's shot advantage of 35-15 tells a fairly decisive tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Against a high-powered team...we did a good job bending but not breaking,\" Blashill added. \"We exited our zone cleaner out of 'D'-zone, which is a positive. It's just that we do [need to] find a way to produce more offense, more chances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Some of it comes down to execution. Some of it comes down to, we've got offensive guys that can produce, but they're probably not feeling it right now. So we've got to get their confidence going.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not exactly surprising the Hawks lack sufficient offensive weapons at this stage of their rebuild, and top prospects Anton Frondell and Roman Kantserov's imminent NHL arrivals should help address the problem. But the organization can't expect them to be saviors.&lt;/p&gt;",

Satellite photos from Airbus showed that the site was heavily bombed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His death at his office “showed that he consistently stood among the people and at the forefront of his responsibilities, confronting what officials call global arrogance,” state TV said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Khamenei, one of the most evil people in History, is dead,” Trump wrote in a social media post.

He led Iran’s clerical establishment and its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, the two main centers of power in the governing theocracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reports trickled out about the death, eyewitnesses in Tehran told The Associated Press that some residents were rejoicing, blowing whistles and letting out ululations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran, which responded to the strikes with its own counterassault, warned of retribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s National Security Council, said Saturday that Israel and America will “regret their actions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brave soldiers and the great nation of Iran will deliver an unforgettable lesson to the hellish international oppressors,” Larijani posted on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Israel launched a major attack on Iran earlier in the day, and Trump called on the Iranian public to “seize control of your destiny” by rising up against the Islamic leadership that has ruled the nation since 1979. Iran retaliated by firing missiles and drones toward Israel and U.S. military bases in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iranian state media, citing the Red Crescent, on Saturday evening said at least 201 people had been killed and more than 700 injured. Iran retaliated by firing missiles and drones toward Israel and U.S. military bases in the region, and exchanges of fire continued into the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the first strikes on Iran appeared to hit near the offices of the 86-year-old supreme leader. Smoke rose from the capital as part of strikes that Iranian media said occurred nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a nationally televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes had targeted Khamenei’s compound and “there are growing signs that the tyrant is no longer alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the address, two Israeli officials said Israel had confirmed his death. The officials both spoke on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement and gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khamenei succeeded Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. He had the final say on all major policies, led Iran’s clerical establishment and personally commanded the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard — the two main centers of power in the country’s theocracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CXP_uPkf_sY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"LIVE: Interceptions in Tel Aviv after US and Israel launch attack on Iran\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video announcing the “major combat operations,” Trump told Iranians that “when we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu echoed that goal, saying, “Our joint operation will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strikes during the holy fasting month of Ramadan opened a stunning new chapter in U.S. intervention in Iran and marked the second time in eight months that the Trump administration has used military force against the Islamic Republic. They also came weeks after a U.S. military operation that captured Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The targets included members of Iran’s leadership, according to a U.S. official and another person briefed on the attacks who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing operation. There was no immediate information on whether top officials had been killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 12 hours after the attacks began, the U.S. military reported no U.S. casualties and minimal damage at U.S. bases despite “hundreds of Iranian missile and drone attacks.” It said targets in Iran included Revolutionary Guard command facilities, air defense capabilities, missile and drone launch sites, and military airfields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various members of Iran’s leadership were targeted in the attack. Israel said it killed the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and the country’s defense minister. The Israeli military also said its strikes killed the secretary of the Iranian Security Council, a close adviser to Khamenei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Iran’s top leaders were to be killed, regime change is not guaranteed and neither the U.S. nor Israel have articulated a vision for what new leadership would look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats decried that Trump had taken action without congressional authorization. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the top House Democrat, said that though Iran is a “bad actor,” the president must nonetheless “seek authorization for the preemptive use of military force that constitutes an act of war.” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration had briefed several Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress in advance of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N. Security Council said it would meet Saturday afternoon. In a letter to the council, Araghchi said Iran will retaliate by all means necessary and “all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile forces in the region shall be regarded as legitimate military objectives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran also requested an urgent session of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors about “these threats to safeguarded nuclear facilities,” according to a letter posted by the semiofficial Tasnim news agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N.’s nuclear watchdog said on X it was closely monitoring developments and had seen “no evidence of radiological impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Iran was in a “near-total internet blackout,” advocacy group NetBlocks said, complicating connections with the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-ad0000\" name=\"module-ad0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What we know so far:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-7d1491b0-14a7-11f1-a6a1-61d08433a9e0\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why the U.S. and Israel attacked:&lt;/b&gt; Tensions have soared in recent weeks as American warships moved into the region, and President Donald Trump said he wanted a deal to constrain Iran’s nuclear program. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the joint attack on the nation Israel considers its archenemy was to “remove an existential threat posed” by Iran.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trump’s statement: &lt;/b&gt;He indicated the U.S. was striking for reasons far beyond the nuclear program, listing grievances stretching back to the beginning of the Islamic Republic following a revolution in 1979 that turned Iran from one of America’s closest allies in the Middle East into a fierce foe. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-trump-address-f662a4f3378535d81197be699fb35a3e\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Read what he said in full.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Airspaces are closing:&lt;/b&gt; Iraq and the United Arab Emirates closed their airspace, and sirens sounded in Jordan. Bahrain said that a missile attack targeted the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet headquarters. Explosions also could be heard in Qatar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;World leaders fear broader escalation:&lt;/b&gt; The strikes create a dilemma for the United States’ democratic allies. While European leaders firmly oppose Iran’s nuclear program and crackdowns by its hard-line theocracy, they are loath to embrace unilateral military action by Trump that could breach international law and unleash a broader conflict.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rising tensions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions have soared in recent weeks as American warships moved into the region. Trump said he wanted a deal to constrain Iran’s nuclear program at a moment when the country is struggling at home with growing dissent following nationwide protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immediate trigger for Saturday’s strikes appears to be the unsuccessful latest round of nuclear talks. But they also reflect the dramatic changes across the region that have left Iran’s leadership in its weakest position since the Islamic Revolution nearly half a century ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli and American strikes last June greatly weakened Iran’s air defenses, military leadership and nuclear program. A regionwide war, sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, has left Iran’s network of proxies across the Middle East greatly weakened. U.S. sanctions and global isolation, meanwhile, have decimated Iran’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran responded to the latest strikes as it had been threatening to do for months, including by launching missiles and drones targeting Israel as well as strikes targeting U.S. military installations in Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar. “The time has come to defend the homeland and confront the enemy’s military assault,” Iran’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 85 people were reported killed at a girls’ school in southern Iran in the Israeli-U.S. strikes, and dozens others were wounded, according to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency. The White House and the Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flights across the Middle East were disrupted and air defense fire thudded over Dubai, the commercial capital of the United Arab Emirates. Shrapnel from an Iranian missile attack on the capital of the UAE killed one person, state media said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-6e0000\" name=\"module-6e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-da0000\" name=\"image-da0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a64cba1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/90dd4ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d930597/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"President Donald Trump explaining why the United States attacked Iran.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d930597/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d2fe59c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d930597/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump explaining why the United States attacked Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;AP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Trump said&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is President Donald Trump’s sttement on Iran in full:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime. A vicious group of very hard, terrible people. Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas, and our allies throughout the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For 47 years, the Iranian regime has chanted Death to America and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder, targeting the United States, our troops and the innocent people in many, many countries. Among the regime’s very first acts was to back a violent takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, holding dozens of American hostages for 444 days. In 1983, Iran’s proxies carried out the marine barracks bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American military personnel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2000, they knew and were probably involved with the attack on the USS Cole. Many died. Iranian forces killed and maimed hundreds of American service members in Iraq. The regime’s proxies have continued to launch countless attacks against American forces stationed in the Middle East in recent years, as well as U.S. naval and commercial vessels and international shipping lines. It’s been mass terror, and we’re not going to put up with it any longer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Lebanon to Yemen and Syria to Iraq, the regime has armed, trained and funded terrorist militias that have soaked the earth with blood and guts. And it was Iran’s proxy, Hamas, that launched the monstrous Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, slaughtering more than 1,000 innocent people, including 46 Americans, while taking 12 of our citizens hostage. It was brutal, something like the world has never seen before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore. Instead, they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and to continue developing the long range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe, our troops stationed overseas, and could soon reach the American homeland. Just imagine how emboldened this regime would be if they ever had, and actually were armed with nuclear weapons as a means to deliver their message.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For these reasons, the United States military is undertaking a massive and ongoing operation to prevent this very wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests. We’re going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally again obliterated. We’re going to annihilate their navy. We’re going to ensure that the region’s terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region or the world and attack our forces, and no longer use their IEDs, or roadside bombs as they are sometimes called, to so gravely wound and kill thousands and thousands of people, including many Americans. And we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. It’s a very simple message. They will never have a nuclear weapon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces. I built and rebuilt our military in my first administration and there is no military on earth even close to its power, strength or sophistication. My administration is taking every possible step to minimize the risk to U.S. personnel in the region. Even so, and I do not make this statement lightly, the Iranian regime seeks to kill. The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost, and we may have casualties. That often happens in war. But we’re doing this not for now. We’re doing this for the future. And it is a noble mission. We pray for every service member as they selflessly risk their lives to ensure that Americans and our children will never be threatened by a nuclear-armed Iran. We ask God to protect all of our heroes in harm’s way. And we trust that with his help, the men and women of the armed forces will prevail. We have the greatest in the world, and they will prevail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the armed forces and all of the police, I say tonight that you must lay down your weapons and have complete immunity. Or in the alternative, face certain death. So, lay down your arms. You will be treated fairly with total immunity, or you will face certain death. Finally, to the great proud people of Iran, I say tonight that the hour of your freedom is at hand. Stay sheltered. Don’t leave your home. It’s very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere. When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For many years, you have asked for America’s help. But you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want. So let’s see how you respond. America is backing you with overwhelming strength and devastating force. Now is the time to seize control of your destiny, and to unleash the prosperous and glorious future that is close within your reach. This is the moment for action. Do not let it pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May God bless the brave men and women of America’s armed forces. May God bless the United States of America. May God bless you all. Thank you.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Attack was coordinated between Israel and U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacks came after weeks of the U.S. military massing forces in the region even as U.S. and Iranian envoys held talks in Switzerland and Oman aimed at finding a diplomatic solution to head off American military operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, a key mediator in the U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, said in a post on X that he was dismayed that the United States and Israel moved forward with the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Active and serious negotiations have yet again been undermined,” said al-Busaidi, who traveled to Washington on Friday to meet with Vice President JD Vance for talks. “Neither the interests of the United States nor the cause of global peace are well served by this. And I pray for the innocents who will suffer. I urge the United States not to get sucked in further.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel said the operation was carried out as a “broad, coordinated, and joint operation against the regime” that has been planned for months between the Israeli and U.S. militaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, in justifying the military action, claimed that Iran has continued to develop its nuclear program and plans to develop missiles to reach the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also acknowledged that there could be American casualties, saying “that often happens in war.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a notable call on Americans to brace themselves from a U.S. leader who swept into office on an “America First” platform and vowed to keep out of “forever wars” that had bogged down his recent predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s statement indicated the U.S. was striking for reasons far beyond the nuclear program, listing grievances stretching back to the beginning of the Islamic Republic following a revolution in 1979 that turned Iran from one of America’s closest allies in the Middle East into a fierce foe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. president said he was aiming to “annihilate” the Iranian navy and destroy regional proxies supported by Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also called on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to lay down its arms, pledging that members would be given immunity, while warning they would face “certain death” if they didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore,” Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump had threatened military action — but held off — following Iran’s recent crackdown on protests spurred by economic grievances and evolved into a nationwide, anti-government push against the ruling clerics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Human Rights Activists News Agency says it confirmed more than 7,000 deaths in the crackdown and that it is investigating thousands more. The government has acknowledged more than 3,000 killed, though it has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran has said it hasn’t enriched since June, but it has blocked international inspectors from visiting the sites America bombed during a 12-day war then. Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press have shown new activity at two of those sites, suggesting Iran is trying to assess and potentially recover material there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran has a self-imposed limit on its ballistic missile program, limiting their range to 1,240 miles. That puts all the Mideast and some of Eastern Europe in their range. There is no public evidence of Iran seeking to have intercontinental ballistic missiles, though Washington has criticized its space program as potentially allowing it to one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran had hoped to avert a war, but maintains it has the right to enrich uranium and does not want to discuss other issues, like its long-range missile program or support for armed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strikes could also have a huge impact on global markets, particularly if Iran is able to make the Strait of Hormuz unsafe for commercial traffic. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil passed through the strait in 2025, about a third of total worldwide oil exports transported by sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Strikes hit targets across Iran&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iranian media reported strikes nationwide. Roads to Khamenei’s compound in downtown Tehran had been shut down by authorities as other blasts rang out across the capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khamenei has not made a public appearance in recent days and wasn’t immediately seen after. During the 12-day war in June, he was believed to have been taken to a secure location away from his Tehran compound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tehran, witnesses heard the first blast by Khamenei’s office. Iranian state television later reported on the explosion, without offering a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More explosions struck Iran’s capital after Israel said it was attacking the country. Authorities have offered no casualty information from the strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targets in the Israeli campaign included Iran’s military, symbols of government and intelligence targets, according to an official briefed on the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic information on the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Iran retaliates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours after the strikes, Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said it launched a “first wave” of drones and missiles targeting Israel, where a nationwide warning was issued as the military said it was working to intercept incoming Iranian missiles. There was no immediate word on any damage or casualties from the ongoing attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Bahrain said that a missile attack targeted the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet headquarters in the island kingdom. Witnesses heard sirens and explosions in Kuwait, home to U.S. Army Central. Explosions also could be heard in Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq and the United Arab Emirates closed their airspace, and sirens sounded in Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials also reported a drone strike hit a headquarters of the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia in Iraq, killing two people and wounding three Saturday. The group had earlier threatened to enter the fray should Iran come under attack. An Israeli military official said Israel was not aware of any Israeli strikes on Kataib Hezbollah headquarters in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, meanwhile, vowed to resume attacks on Red Sea shipping routes and on Israel, according to two senior Houthi officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no official announcement from the Houthi leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. embassies or consulates in Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Israel posted on social media that they told staffers to shelter in place and recommended all Americans “do the same until further notice.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

All these wars are just for profit,” protesters shouted as others pounded drums to the chants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some carried signs, including a large, red banner that read, “No boots on the ground. No bombs in the air. U.S. out of everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Israel launched a major attack on Iran early Saturday, and President Donald Trump called on the Iranian public to “seize control of your destiny” by rising up against the Islamic leadership that has ruled the nation since 1979. Iran retaliated by firing missiles and drones toward Israel and U.S. military bases in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/nation-world/2026/02/28/iran-trump-israel\"   &gt;Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei died&lt;/a&gt; following a major attack by Israel and the United States, Iranian state media confirmed early Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reports trickled out about the death, eyewitnesses in Tehran told The Associated Press that some residents were rejoicing, blowing whistles and letting out ululations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, around 100 demonstrators in Chicago who supported the strikes rallied in Daley Plaza, flying American flags and the pre-revolution Iranian flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 200 people were killed on the first day of fighting, including 115 reported dead when a girls’ school was struck. More than 700 were injured in the attacks, according to Iranian state media, citing the Red Crescent. The U.S. military reported no U.S. casualties and minimal damage at U.S. bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Saturday evening's antiwar protest, Ali Tarokh, an Iranian American and refugee rights advocate, said, “The message is simple: Stop this war.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"As an Iranian American who arrived here 13 years ago, I’m telling you, stop this war. This is not Iranian war. We don’t want this war,” Tarokh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and other protesters laid the attacks at the feet of President Trump and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling it “Netanyahu’s playbook.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“War is not the solution,” Tarokh said. “We have problems, we have challenges inside Iran, but it’s our problem, our challenges. We are able, we are mighty, we are strong. … Bombing and striking, war do not bring democracy into our country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters viewed the strikes as a violation of international and U.S. law, and as a punishment for Iran’s support of Gaza in its war with Israel. They repeatedly called for U.S. divestment from Israel and military attacks, arguing that funding should be diverted to health care and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-4a0000\" name=\"image-4a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c2dc159/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F2d%2Fe5973d0c4d3c913f3d95ac3356b4%2Fprotest-26301-03.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8079297/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F2d%2Fe5973d0c4d3c913f3d95ac3356b4%2Fprotest-26301-03.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24efc92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F2d%2Fe5973d0c4d3c913f3d95ac3356b4%2Fprotest-26301-03.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"PROTEST_26301-03.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24efc92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F2d%2Fe5973d0c4d3c913f3d95ac3356b4%2Fprotest-26301-03.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9908950/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F2d%2Fe5973d0c4d3c913f3d95ac3356b4%2Fprotest-26301-03.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24efc92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F2d%2Fe5973d0c4d3c913f3d95ac3356b4%2Fprotest-26301-03.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters call for an end to the U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran during a demonstration in Federal Plaza in the Loop, Saturday, Feb. 28, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giacomo Cain/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The people of this country do not want another forever war,” said Yusuf Masood, a member of the Anti-War Committee of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While millions here can barely afford to get by on a daily basis, forced to work long and arduous hours with little government support, the very same government sends billions of dollars abroad to support war on Iran and Israel’s crimes against Palestine,” Masood said. “We must stand resolutely in solidarity with the people of Iran, who only want to live free from becoming another vassal state of the U.S. empire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois' Democratic leaders also criticized the attacks, claiming Trump carried them out without congressional approval.

But none of that matters to Donald Trump — and apparently neither do the safety and lives of American service members,\" Gov.

It has been very successful; lots of people attend. We serve wonderful food and wine. Two attendees rarely miss this event, although they have never actually been invited. They come by default with their spouses, whom we did invite many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not fond of these two women because they are whiny and annoying. They go on and on about their ailments and life problems, and they rarely have anything insightful to say about the books we discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My spouse and I wonder if they have ever read any book, much less one of the books we cover. We're not sure if anyone else who attends feels the same way, but we do know that some of our friends have hung out with them. I often tell my spouse we need to drop them from the invitation list. She says we can't because the other attendees will notice, and we'll look like the bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is my partner right? Is there any way to stop inviting them without looking mean? I'm worried we will be stuck hosting the pair forever into our old age. — &lt;i&gt;HATES THIS PLOT IN THE WEST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR HATES THIS PLOT:&lt;/b&gt; You very well may wind up hosting those two pills in perpetuity — UNLESS, at the next meeting, you establish some rules that should have been made clear from the beginning. In order to participate in these get-togethers, members of the group must have read the book under discussion and refrain from discussing other topics during the meetings. To do this is not unreasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My mom and I recently got into an argument about her mortgage. I'm on the mortgage and title to her home because she couldn't afford to be on it by herself and needed my income and credit to help her. So, I did. I helped her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am now married, and my husband would like to refinance our home. The problem is, I'm still on the mortgage to my mother's house. I have asked her twice before to let me off the mortgage, and she responded by saying, \"I can't. I need you.\" When I asked again this last time, she blew up at me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She thinks my husband is controlling me or manipulating me to ask her to let me off the mortgage. Now she \"hates him\" and doesn't want to see him or his family. She's barely talking to me and acting super cruel and vindictive. It hurts me that she is acting like a 5-year-old having a temper tantrum. I'm so sad. I just don't know what to do anymore. Advice? — &lt;i&gt;ENSLAVED IN MARYLAND&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ENSLAVED:&lt;/b&gt; You have my sympathy. Getting your name (and the financial guarantee that goes with it) off your mother's mortgage may not be as simple as you would wish. It's time you spoke about this with an attorney with an expertise in real estate, because extricating yourself may be both time consuming and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

And built many war memorials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wandering around Washington, D.C., I made a point to stop by the biggies — the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, No. 1 in my book, for breaking war's symbolic stranglehold on imagined glory. A black granite gash in the earth featuring not eagles but the names of the 58,318 American dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Korean War Veterans Memorial, a night patrol of 19 stainless steel figures, in ponchos against the cold rain, faces etched with stress and fatigue, frozen in mid-stride. Even the sprawling, soulless World War II Memorial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-ad0000\" name=\"module-ad0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Opinion bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World War I Memorial wasn't on my radar. Until I found myself next to it, at the corner of 15th and Pennsylvania Avenue. A few extra steps, and there was Sabin Howard's epic sculpture \"A Soldier's Journey.\" Starting with a doughboy taking leave of his wife and daughter, charging into combat,&amp;nbsp;men around him killed, wounded, with a homecoming at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World War I is a stark reminder of the greasy slope of war — what started with an assassinated Austrian archduke exploded into fighting in across the globe, ending 31 years later — historians consider World War II an extension of World War I, after a 21-year intermission to raise a new generation of cannon fodder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;War between the United States and Iran commenced Saturday. It'll end... nobody knows, of course. We assume it'll be a few tightly contained airstrikes, like last summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then war always seems quick, at the outset, with the boys hurrahing down to the recruiting office to sign up, worried the action will be over before Christmas. The Russians, don't forget, rolled into Ukraine four years ago, expecting to be in Kyiv in a few days. They're still fighting, having lost an estimated 200,000 men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;When World War I broke out in 1914, President Woodrow Wilson, promised not to get involved. \"He kept us out of war\" was his re-election slogan in 1916. \"No new wars,\" Donald Trump echoed in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both promises worked. Both were broken. Both with reason. Iran is the worst sponsor of international terrorism — Hamas could have never pulled off the Oct. 7 attacks without Iran's enthusiastic backing — making it impossible not to welcome the elimination of&amp;nbsp;Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \"It's been mass terror, and we're not going to put up with it any longer,\" Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You go, Mr. President. Add it to the list of Trump successes, along with elimination of the penny. Whether that counterbalances scuttling voting rights, well, you decide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're attacking Iran now... why exactly? To destroy its capacity to produce nuclear weapons? Sounds laudable. But also very... familiar. Didn't we just do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A spectacular military success” Trump said after the strikes last July. “Iran’s key enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Totally, again, obliterated,\" Trump said Saturday. Maybe it'll stick this time. We're also calling for regime change. That seems naive — how well did that work in Afghanistan? Or to return to World War I: remember the regime Germany ended up with after Versailles. We liked the Nazis even less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-520000\" name=\"image-520000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9d17291/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5704x3201+0+301/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3f%2Fc6%2F4664b4c24623881bfda3e2c8fe98%2Fap26060537702769.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b221b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5704x3201+0+301/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3f%2Fc6%2F4664b4c24623881bfda3e2c8fe98%2Fap26060537702769.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1545048/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5704x3201+0+301/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3f%2Fc6%2F4664b4c24623881bfda3e2c8fe98%2Fap26060537702769.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A black plume of smoke rises from a warehouse at the industrial area of Sharjah City in the United Arab Emirates following reports of Iranian strikes in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Sunday, March 1, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1545048/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5704x3201+0+301/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3f%2Fc6%2F4664b4c24623881bfda3e2c8fe98%2Fap26060537702769.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4387ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5704x3201+0+301/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3f%2Fc6%2F4664b4c24623881bfda3e2c8fe98%2Fap26060537702769.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1545048/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5704x3201+0+301/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3f%2Fc6%2F4664b4c24623881bfda3e2c8fe98%2Fap26060537702769.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A black plume of smoke rises from a warehouse at the industrial area of Sharjah City in the United Arab Emirates following reports of Iranian strikes in Dubai, United Arab Emirates Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altaf Qadri/AP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new war seems doubly troubling when you look at our own besieged democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's domestic politics,\" said Timothy Snyder, whose books such as \"On Tyranny\" explore the rise of repressive regimes and how we risk becoming one of them. \"The need to create some kind of foreign conflict so Trump can say we have to do special things around the elections. I honestly think its as simple as that.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alas, World War I has lessons here, too — the government cracked down on dissidents, jailing pacifists, deporting foreign nationals who dared oppose the bloodshed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;War is a gamble. When you win big early on — kidnapping Maduro, killing Khamenei — you can fall under the spell of imagining it's a game you can win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be argued that to start a war is to lose it. That's the sense you get, standing before any war memorial. Though now might not be the time to go to Washington — I know people who were afraid to step foot in Chicago Sunday, worried about blundering into some ad hoc Iranian counterstrike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you do go to D.C., definitely visit the memorial to Vietnam, that bloody bog that took years to extricate ourselves from. And do seek out the World War I Memorial. The 58-foot wide sculpture is a true masterpiece, including a bit of the glory that some still itch to attach to war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is how the National Park Service web site puts it: \"At the center our hero calls his comrades into battle, illustrating the famous American battle cry from Belleau Wood: 'Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever?'\"&lt;/p&gt;",

Teams play well for a week or two and then may struggle for a few games before finding their feet again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no time for that in the one-and-done playoffs. A team can find itself buried with the season basically over after several bad minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockport's players all referenced intensity after the Porters demolished Joliet West in what was supposed to be a very competitive Class 4A regional final on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If we come out with intensity nobody can stop us,\" Lockport senior point guard Nathan Munson said. \"[Against Joliet West] we came out with that. You saw the results.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockport joins the rankings at No. 21 after the victory. The Porters were ranked a few weeks ago but fell out after losing at Sandburg. Junior twins Nedas and Nojus Venckus lead the team, which is expected to be a Super 25 regular next season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockport coach Dave Wilson had heavy praise for the twins on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"When your best players work their tails off every day it is contagious,\" Wilson said. \"The twins work so hard in everything that the other teammates have no choice. When your leaders buy into intensity and they don’t take plays off, they don’t take practices off, they don’t take drills off, then the other 14 sure as heck don’t have an excuse.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Porters move on to the Joliet West Sectional, where they will be underdogs against No. 11 Marist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simeon's big week&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simeon was actually No. 10 in the preseason Super 25 back in November. That was partly due to some confusion over the roster. Coach Tim Flowers didn't have a star, but returned a very experienced core. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wolverines' season hit a skid at the Pekin Holiday Tournament in late December with consecutive losses to Springfield, Morton and Crane. Simeon lost by 10 points to Lincoln Park in the city tournament and didn't advance to the final four. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Wolverines earned their way back into the Super 25 this week with impressive wins against Riverside-Brookfield and Young. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simeon will face No. 14 St. Ignatius in the Class 4A Mount Carmel Sectional semifinals on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Super 25 updates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were several close, competitive regional finals but very few upsets. The top half of the Super 25 remained largely unchanged, with only New Trier's win against St. Patrick shaking things up a bit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hersey and St. Laurence rejoined the rankings along with Lockport and Simeon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brother Rice makes its season debut. The Crusaders have been solid since November and played several good teams tight in losses, picking up single-digit defeats against Mount Carmel, Marist, Loyola and Neuqua Valley. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will face No. 7 Homewood-Flossmoor in the Joliet West Sectional on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Super 25 high school basketball rankings for March 1, 2026&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With record and last week's ranking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.

And it was reinforced on another smoking cover of Blaze Foley’s “Oval Room.” Originally written in the ’80s about Ronald Reagan, the song “feels fitting right now,” Price said, singing her heart out on the lyrics, “he’s the president, but I don’t care!” and flipping both her birds as the sold-out crowd roared in approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the bold, loudmouth “Hard Headed Woman” everyone paid to see — and got their money’s worth in a 90-minute showdown that was as much honky-tonk as it was straight shooting from the hip about current issues often snuffed out of modern mainstream country music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f10000\" name=\"image-f10000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7824f88/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2F36%2F1fbb24f54069852ead09fd3fabdb%2Fmargoprice-260302-07.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/88a7dc2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2F36%2F1fbb24f54069852ead09fd3fabdb%2Fmargoprice-260302-07.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e5be35f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2F36%2F1fbb24f54069852ead09fd3fabdb%2Fmargoprice-260302-07.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Margo Price performs Saturday at Metro in Wrigleyville. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e5be35f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2F36%2F1fbb24f54069852ead09fd3fabdb%2Fmargoprice-260302-07.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1a3d724/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2F36%2F1fbb24f54069852ead09fd3fabdb%2Fmargoprice-260302-07.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e5be35f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2F36%2F1fbb24f54069852ead09fd3fabdb%2Fmargoprice-260302-07.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margo Price performs Saturday at Metro in Wrigleyville.

Still, Price (who was born and raised in Aledo in western Illinois) creates a sound that fits in with the best of Nashville, past and present. Whether it’s a barn raiser like “Red Eye Flight,” the rockabilly twang beauty of “Wild At Heart,” the acoustic slide lullaby “Close To You” or the sassy “Don’t Wake Me Up,” a song written in her childhood bedroom a few Christmases ago, Price’s material has a retro-country seal that has throughlines to Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Emmylou Harris and Dolly Parton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-990000\" name=\"image-990000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e3414bf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F86%2Fb0%2F5d196aca44b68df1b860049eff25%2Fmargoprice-260302-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bf843df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F86%2Fb0%2F5d196aca44b68df1b860049eff25%2Fmargoprice-260302-09.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c269f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F86%2Fb0%2F5d196aca44b68df1b860049eff25%2Fmargoprice-260302-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Margo Price performs at Metro in Wrigleyville, Saturday, Feb. 28, 2026. | Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c269f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F86%2Fb0%2F5d196aca44b68df1b860049eff25%2Fmargoprice-260302-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a5f82d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F86%2Fb0%2F5d196aca44b68df1b860049eff25%2Fmargoprice-260302-09.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c269f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F86%2Fb0%2F5d196aca44b68df1b860049eff25%2Fmargoprice-260302-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margo Price performs Saturday at Metro in Wrigleyville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visuals furthered the Music City vibe, like the cowboy hats that appeared in the crowd and onstage or Price’s ensemble of knee-high suede boots that stomped the floor and long fringe cuff bracelets that swayed furiously as she strummed her guitar or slapped her tambourine. Or, the cowhide rugs, salt lamps and mushroom stools on the stage that made Metro feel like an intimate back-of-the-bar listening room, especially when coupled with an exceptional band that commanded attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alec Newman’s tender and steady bass, Brandon Combs’ controlled drum beats and Sean Thompson’s incredible wielding of electric guitar that often veered off into “Freebird”-level solos were incredible accompaniments to the night’s soundscape. Price’s chemistry with guitarist Logan Ledger (who also opened the show with his solo material) was palpable as they beautifully dueted on “Close To You” and “Love Me Like You Used To,” with Ledger perfectly taking over the reins for Tyler Childers, who appears on the recorded collab track. Ledger also had a moment in the main set to wow the crowd with his original tune, “All The Wine In California” as Price took a reprieve to head backstage to change into a silver sequined dress for the encore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/music/2025/09/04/margo-price-evanston-folk-festival-headliner\"   &gt;Country singer-songwriter Margo Price’s heart remains firmly planted in Illinois: ‘The Midwest will always be my home’&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/music/2024/12/04/mavis-staples-says-i-dont-ever-want-to-stop-singing-as-stars-gather-to-perform-at-85th-birthday-celebration\"   &gt;Mavis Staples says ‘I don’t ever want to stop singing’ as stars gather to perform at 85th birthday celebration&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Both these guys on either side of me have records downstairs,” Price said, promoting the great talents of Thompson and Ledger, knowing full well she wasn’t the only star of the night. The merch booth also had a spotlight on Farm Aid — as Price shared, with any donation, fans were able to enter to win one of her signed signature guitars. “We need to support our local farmers!” Price demanded. A few steps after she performed the Spanish folk song “De Colores,” an anthem linked to the United Farm Workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all the standout moments of the night, the one that stuck after the show ended was her rollicking single “Don’t Let the Bastards Get You Down,” that called for resiliency and to keep up the fight in the face of adversity. It’s songs like these that have netted Price co-signs from her heroes and generational game changers like Joan Baez, Kris Kristofferson and fellow Illinoisan Mavis Staples with whom Price worked on the 2022 song “Fight to Make It,” with proceeds going to reproductive justice organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price’s material hearkens back to the very foundation of country music that was used as protest — and “outlaw” or not, she dares to press the community on what the America they sing about really stands for. As she ended the night throwing roses out to the crowd, you can only hope she saved one for herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Margo Price set list for Feb. 28 concert at Metro in Chicago&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;About To Find Out&lt;br&gt;Wild At Heart&lt;br&gt;Red Eye Flight&lt;br&gt;Don’t Wake Me Up&lt;br&gt;Close To You&lt;br&gt;Love Me Like You Used To Do&lt;br&gt;I Just Don’t Give A Damn (George Jones cover)&lt;br&gt;Tennessee Song&lt;br&gt;Keep A Picture&lt;br&gt;Prelude (Hard Headed Woman)&lt;br&gt;Don't Let the Bastards Get You Down&lt;br&gt;Oval Room (Blaze Foley cover)&lt;br&gt;De Colores (traditional cover)&lt;br&gt;Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos) (Woody Guthrie cover)&lt;br&gt;All The Wine In California (Logan Ledger cover)&lt;br&gt;Kissing You Goodbye (Waylon Jennings cover)&lt;br&gt;Hurtin’ (on the Bottle)&lt;br&gt;Maggie’s Farm (Bob Dylan cover)&lt;/p&gt;",

I'm ready to play some real meaningful baseball and just go wear those colors. I haven't done it for some years, and getting to do it at the highest stage is going to be special.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong and Bregman each collected two hits Sunday against the White Sox, with Bregman planning to host a few of his Team USA teammates at his house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman hasn’t lost in international competition while playing for Team USA four times at the college level and in the 2017 WBC, and he relishes the bond with his teammates for short periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what is about it, it’s probably the stars and stripes, to be honest,” Bregman said. “You become a family and a team really quickly. Even though we’re in different camps now, we’ll be in the same clubhouse (Monday).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The coolest part about it is the bond that’s created right away when you step in that locker room when you know what you’re representing and playing for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman’s first three weeks with the Cubs has been smooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like our team's in a really good place right now,” Bregman said. “Guys are focused and locked in, ready for the season, getting preparing every day. I think it's a great group. And I'm very excited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team USA opens pool play Friday against Brazil in Houston. Among the other prominent Cubs players participating in the WBC are pitcher Jameson Taillon (Canada), outfielder Seiya Suzuki (Japan), pitcher Javier Asaad (Mexico), catchers Miguel Amaya and Christian Bethancourt (Panama) and closer Daniel Palencia (Venezuela).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Outfield auditions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The departures of Crow-Armstrong and Suzuki create more opportunities for Michael Conforto, Dylan Carlson, Chas McCormick and Kevin Alcantara for a backup spot in the outfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s probably where we benefit from it,” Counsell said “The other side of is, you'd love to have your guys around.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counsell confirmed that Alcantara, who played his first game Saturday as the designated hitter after recovering from hernia surgery, will make his first start in the outfield Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shaw salad&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glut of backup outfield auditions could cut into playing time for infielder Matt Shaw and his utility role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d love for him to have 50 games out there, but that’s not realistic,” Counsell said. “Eight-ish games? That’s where we’re at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ben is back&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infielder Ben Cowles was claimed off waivers by the Blue Jays. To make room for Cowles on the 40-man roster, pitcher Shelby Miller was placed on the 60-day injured list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks the third time Cowles has joined the Cubs. Cowles was waived by the Cubs after Miller was signed on Feb. 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;White Sox 5, Cubs 1&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left-hander Shota Imanaga was tagged for three solo home runs in 2 2/3 innings. One encouraging aspect was that Imanaga’s fastball topped out at 95 mph, but his bigger concern is that he will be able to sustain that velocity as he pitches deeper into games. Sox top outfield prospect Braden Montgomery tagged an 82 mph slider by Imanaga for a solo homer in the second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Poor fundamentals gnawed at manager Craig Counsell in 2024, but he can be assured that the rundown drills performed this spring have carried out to exhibition games. Shortstop Dansby Swanson fielded Tanner Murray’s grounder and threw quickly to home plate, where catcher Carson Kelly chased Edgar Quero to third before Alex Bregman tagged him in the fifth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Pete Crow-Armstrong batted only .188 against left-handers last season, but he did an exceptional job of slapping a slider from Sox left-hander Anthony Kay into left field for a single in the second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• On deck: Cubs at Reds, 2:05 p.m. Monday, Goodyear, Marquee, Jameson Taillon vs. Brady Singer.&lt;/p&gt;",

The day honors a Revolutionary War hero and the city’s vibrant Polish American community. Here’s what to know about the holiday, its history and how it will be celebrated this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s closed for Pulaski Day?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Chicago and Cook County government offices and courts will be closed on Monday, March 2. Chicago Public Library locations will also be closed all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most schools, including Chicago Public Schools, will be open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post offices and banks will also be open, as it is not a federal holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who was Casimir Pulaski?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casimir Pulaski was a Polish military leader who fought against Russian control in Poland before joining the American Revolution. After meeting Benjamin Franklin in Paris, Pulaski traveled to America in 1777 and quickly became a key figure in the American Revolutionary War, according to the Chicago Public Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulaski organized and led the country’s first cavalry, earning him the title “Father of the American Cavalry,” according to the National Park Service. Pulaski died in 1779 from injuries during the Battle of Savannah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His name is now a familiar sight in Chicago — seen on Pulaski Road, Pulaski Park and other landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is Pulaski Day?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulaski Day, observed on the first Monday of March, honors Pulaski’s role in the American Revolution and celebrates the contributions of Chicago’s Polish American community. The holiday is held around Pulaski’s birthday, March 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois established the holiday in 1977 under Gov. James Thompson. In 1986, the Chicago City Council passed a resolution introduced by Mayor Harold Washington to officially recognize it, following strong advocacy from local Polish organizations and community leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago’s Polish population — one of the largest outside of Poland — has long used Pulaski Day to celebrate Pulaski’s legacy and its cultural heritage. As of 2023, about 130,000 Chicago residents and more than 720,000 people in the Chicago metro area have Polish ancestry, according to the Census Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois is the only state with an official Pulaski Day. However, New York City and Buffalo, New York, which have significant Polish communities, mark Pulaski’s contributions with parades held at different times of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulaski Day was initially observed with school closures across Illinois, but that changed beginning in the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How is Pulaski celebrated?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago’s celebrations center on an annual event at the Polish Museum of America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Pulaski has been memorialized in the U.S. for generations,\" Richard Owsiany, president of the Polish Museum of America, said last year. \"For almost 30 years, the museum has hosted this event to honor what he did for the country and to keep his legacy alive.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's event will include remarks from Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs, Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas and others. It will also feature live artistic performances, filmed presentations and the traditional wreath-laying ceremony at Stanislaw Batowski’s painting of \"Pulaski at Savannah.\" The public can view the event at 10 a.m. Monday at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"http://www.PolishMuseumOfAmerica.org\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;PolishMuseumOfAmerica.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What does Pulaski Day mean for the Polish community in Chicago?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many in Chicago’s Polish community, Pulaski Day is about more than remembering a historic figure — it’s a chance to celebrate the heritage and come together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pulaski came to the U.S. to fight for your freedom and ours,” Bogdan Pukszta, executive director of the Polish American Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview before the holiday in 2025. “For Poles like me, who were born in Poland, Pulaski is someone we grew up learning about. Here, it’s about sharing that legacy with the broader American community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pukszta moved to Chicago in the early 1980s, just before Illinois recognized the holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When Pulaski Day was first established, all schools had the day off. That’s changed, but the meaning hasn’t,” he said. “It’s an opportunity for us to celebrate, reflect and catch up with the community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Events like Pulaski Day also help younger generations stay connected to their roots, Pukszta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For those familiar with Poland, Pulaski is a hero. For Americans, he should be remembered as someone who fought for this country’s freedom,” he said. “This holiday bridges both identities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago’s Polish community gathers for other key events like the May 3 Constitution Day Parade and Polish Independence Day in November — but Pulaski Day holds a unique place as a symbol of shared history between Poland and the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just about Polish pride,” Pukszta said. “It’s about honoring someone who fought for both nations and recognizing the contributions of Polish Americans to Illinois.”&lt;/p&gt;",

So I would say, keep that in mind as we're talking and thinking about this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele’s injury was the first of several injuries that eventually caught up to the Cubs and cost them a chance at advancing to the National League Championship Series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow left-hander Shota Imanaga faded late, and rookie sensation Cade Horton suffered a right rib fracture shortly before the end of the regular season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs settled for Mike Soroka instead of ponying up for Shane Bieber at the trade deadline, and Soroka went on the injured list and missed six weeks because of a shoulder strain while Bieber posted a 4-2 record after his trade from the Guardians to the Blue Jays, who won Game 4 of the World Series with Bieber limited the World Champion Dodgers to four hits in 5 1/3 innings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs fortified their rotation this winter with the acquisition of Edward Cabrera that cost them top outfield prospect Owen Caissie, and the anticipated return of Steele — who posted a 3.10 ERA in 78 starts from 2022-24 — could bring more than the equivalent of a mid-season trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manager Craig Counsell remains cautiously optimistic about Steele’s progress and his long-range view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re on the same page, and we’ll keep communicating,” Counsell said. “As you’re going through (rehab), you never want to slow down. You want to earn very step and make progress. And I think that’s a very important part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let me throw some other things in the equation. We got to kind of balance that all out, but I think we'll come up with something good, and I think the timing of this is going to be really good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After receiving clearance from Dr. Keith Meister (as part of his Arizona visit to check on the progress of his patients), Steele will be allowed to incorporate breaking pitches into his pitch mix as he increases the intensity of his rehab from 35-40 pitches to eventually facing batters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs are stretching out Colin Rea and Javier Asaad to serve as insurance in the event projected starters Jameson Tallion, Matthew Boyd, Imanaga, Cabrera and Horton aren’t available by the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rea made 27 starts last season, and Asaad could start a game for Team Mexico in the World Baseball Classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counsell anticipates Rea will start “a lot of games this year,” and his ability to shift between the rotation and bullpen is “what makes seasons and make the stability of that is what makes seasons go well and go smoothly and helps those around you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele, meanwhile, is eager to celebrate any milestone such as getting clearance from Meister while feeling no urge to rush with rotation depth he described as “amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's really important that I'm hitting my stride at that point. That's when it’s going to help the team the most.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
