It's good to see that he's ready to go, and he's feeling good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But as far as for me, I don't think anything changes. That stuff's out of my control. We have such a deep staff that we got plenty of guys that can fill those roles. And like we're saying earlier, whatever Counce for us, we'll be ready.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele wrote on his post that Meister had told him to “start building up and get ready for games” after posting a video of his bullpen session Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs have yet to put Steele on the 60-day injured list, but that could be a formality if they need to clear space on the 40-man roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as for Rea, who made 27 starts for the Cubs in 2025, there’s plenty of work ahead - especially with his changeup - as he threw only 29 of 51 pitches for strikes and fell behind in counts often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think (the changeup) needs to get better (to left-handed batters),” Rea said. “I think my games last year, where I did well, and my changeup was a big part of those. Early in spring, it hasn't been good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pete Speak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pete Crow-Armstrong possesses a colorful language, that sometimes needs an explanation or even a translation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manager Craig Counsell said he sought answers after failing to understand his prized center fielder’s self-examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes, Pete says things that I have no idea what they mean, no idea what they mean,” Counsell said. “And even when he explains them, they have no idea what he means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But that's OK. I like that. I enjoy that. It actually makes me think a little bit, and a lot of players do that, so it's fun. I just think that's a very personal thing that I think we all hope that we get better at that as we just get older, no matter what you're doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He said something yesterday. ‘I (said), Pete can you explain because I don't know what it means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hodge podge&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porter Hodge continues to struggle with finding his control that helped him emerge as a standout reliever in 2024 when he posted an 0.884 WHIP to go with a 1.88 ERA in 39 appearances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to be in the strike zone more, flat out,” Counsell said of Hodge, who has walked seven in two innings covering three spring games. “I think we got walks in every outing, multiple walks in two of three.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cubs 6, Dodgers 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Brown pitched with plenty of conviction during two scoreless innings. The most encouraging aspect of Brown’s performance was that he didn’t walk a batter while using his knuckle curve effectively to complement his 97 mph fastball and struck out three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Christian Bethancourt, vying for a backup catching job, made his spring debut and made a favorable impression on starter Colin Rea. This marked the first time they worked together since their days with the Padres 10 years ago, and Rea appreciated that Bethancourt challenged him by mixing speeds early in counts and not allowing him to get into a pattern. Bethancourt will depart soon to play for Team Panama in the WBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Keep an eye on Kevin Alcantara. The Cubs’ top outfield prospect, also making his spring debut after undergoing hernia surgery, employed a new wider batting stance. Alcantara went 0-for-4 with two strikeouts but fouled off five pitches during a nine-pitch sequence in his first at-bat before flying to center. Alcantara, who has one minor league option left, said he will make a start in the outfield on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;b&gt;ON DECK:&lt;/b&gt; Cubs vs. White Sox, Sunday, 1:05 p.m., Mesa, Ariz.

His teammates, yet again, did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it was a similar story for the Hawks in their 3-1 loss to the Avalanche as in their &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/02/26/blackhawks-connor-bedard-fire-predators-nhl-power-play-quarterback\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;4-2 loss Thursday&lt;/a&gt; against the Predators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bedard has scored in both games and racked up eight shots on goal. Every other Hawk has combined for one goal and 30 shots over the two games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We've got to help him,\" captain Nick Foligno said Saturday. \"[It] can't just be on Connor. He's doing his job. He's getting scoring chances. He's making plays. He could have had five [goals] tonight. So it's on the rest of us to pick it up and find a way to help him out, give him some run support.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bedard's power-play snipe early in the first period held up for some time, but Cale Makar ultimately equalized for the Avalanche with eight seconds left in the second period, breaking through solid Hawks goalie Spencer Knight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gavin Brindley gave the hosts their first lead with 12:29 left and Makar added an empty-netter to improve the Avalanche's home record to a ridiculous 22-4-4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks, meanwhile, are now 4-10-2 over their last 16 games (dating back to Jan. 9), and they've scored only 31 goals during that span —&amp;nbsp;averaging less than two per game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bedard is undeniably doing his part since the Olympic break. In addition to the goal, he pushed through contact to get to the net more than usual Saturday, and he also got involved in skirmishes more than usual. The fire blazing underneath him isn't dying down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;GOAL: Connor Bedard with a SNIPE on the power play for his 25th goal of the season! &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/BL6eYGziBB\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BL6eYGziBB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; BHF (@BlackhawksFocus) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BlackhawksFocus/status/2027886601846542557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 28, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks at least had one other line going Saturday, which is more than they could claim Thursday. Coach Jeff Blashill united the veteran trio of Jason Dickinson, Ilya Mikheyev and Tyler Bertuzzi to \"tilt the ice\" against the NHL's top team, and they did just that. They were excellent in the first period especially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But second-line center Frank Nazar, despite faster movement in transition Saturday, continues to generate less production than the Hawks desperately need him to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth line has generated very little all season long. Depth forwards Foligno, Colton Dach and Landon Slaggert have seven goals combined, and Ryan Donato has also struggled whenever demoted to that role (as he was Saturday).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And first-line winger Andre Burakovsky, who clicked so seamlessly with Bedard early on this season, hasn't looked any better exiting the break than he did entering it — even though he continues to have an avid defender in Blashill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blashill mentioned how Burakovsky led the team in scoring-chance differential against the Predators (according to the Hawks' internal analytics). He stated Burakovsky will remain with Bedard on Sunday against the Mammoth as their road trip continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blashill did agree with the basic sentiment about needing more depth scoring, though. He maligned some mishandled pucks that negated potential odd-man rushes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things might've played out differently had Dickinson converted — rather than hit the crossbar on — a breakaway 20 seconds in, as well. But Avalanche's shot advantage of 35-15 tells a fairly decisive tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Against a high-powered team...we did a good job bending but not breaking,\" Blashill added. \"We exited our zone cleaner out of 'D'-zone, which is a positive. It's just that we do [need to] find a way to produce more offense, more chances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Some of it comes down to execution. Some of it comes down to, we've got offensive guys that can produce, but they're probably not feeling it right now. So we've got to get their confidence going.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not exactly surprising the Hawks lack sufficient offensive weapons at this stage of their rebuild, and top prospects Anton Frondell and Roman Kantserov's imminent NHL arrivals should help address the problem. But the organization can't expect them to be saviors.&lt;/p&gt;",

Satellite photos from Airbus showed that the site was heavily bombed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His death at his office “showed that he consistently stood among the people and at the forefront of his responsibilities, confronting what officials call global arrogance,” state TV said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Khamenei, one of the most evil people in History, is dead,” Trump wrote in a social media post.

He led Iran’s clerical establishment and its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, the two main centers of power in the governing theocracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reports trickled out about the death, eyewitnesses in Tehran told The Associated Press that some residents were rejoicing, blowing whistles and letting out ululations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran, which responded to the strikes with its own counterassault, warned of retribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s National Security Council, said Saturday that Israel and America will “regret their actions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brave soldiers and the great nation of Iran will deliver an unforgettable lesson to the hellish international oppressors,” Larijani posted on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Israel launched a major attack on Iran earlier in the day, and Trump called on the Iranian public to “seize control of your destiny” by rising up against the Islamic leadership that has ruled the nation since 1979. Iran retaliated by firing missiles and drones toward Israel and U.S. military bases in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iranian state media, citing the Red Crescent, on Saturday evening said at least 201 people had been killed and more than 700 injured. Iran retaliated by firing missiles and drones toward Israel and U.S. military bases in the region, and exchanges of fire continued into the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the first strikes on Iran appeared to hit near the offices of the 86-year-old supreme leader. Smoke rose from the capital as part of strikes that Iranian media said occurred nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a nationally televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes had targeted Khamenei’s compound and “there are growing signs that the tyrant is no longer alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the address, two Israeli officials said Israel had confirmed his death. The officials both spoke on condition of anonymity pending a formal announcement and gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khamenei succeeded Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. He had the final say on all major policies, led Iran’s clerical establishment and personally commanded the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard — the two main centers of power in the country’s theocracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CXP_uPkf_sY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"LIVE: Interceptions in Tel Aviv after US and Israel launch attack on Iran\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video announcing the “major combat operations,” Trump told Iranians that “when we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Netanyahu echoed that goal, saying, “Our joint operation will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strikes during the holy fasting month of Ramadan opened a stunning new chapter in U.S. intervention in Iran and marked the second time in eight months that the Trump administration has used military force against the Islamic Republic. They also came weeks after a U.S. military operation that captured Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The targets included members of Iran’s leadership, according to a U.S. official and another person briefed on the attacks who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing operation. There was no immediate information on whether top officials had been killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 12 hours after the attacks began, the U.S. military reported no U.S. casualties and minimal damage at U.S. bases despite “hundreds of Iranian missile and drone attacks.” It said targets in Iran included Revolutionary Guard command facilities, air defense capabilities, missile and drone launch sites, and military airfields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various members of Iran’s leadership were targeted in the attack. Israel said it killed the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and the country’s defense minister. The Israeli military also said its strikes killed the secretary of the Iranian Security Council, a close adviser to Khamenei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if Iran’s top leaders were to be killed, regime change is not guaranteed and neither the U.S. nor Israel have articulated a vision for what new leadership would look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats decried that Trump had taken action without congressional authorization. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the top House Democrat, said that though Iran is a “bad actor,” the president must nonetheless “seek authorization for the preemptive use of military force that constitutes an act of war.” White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration had briefed several Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress in advance of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N. Security Council said it would meet Saturday afternoon. In a letter to the council, Araghchi said Iran will retaliate by all means necessary and “all bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile forces in the region shall be regarded as legitimate military objectives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran also requested an urgent session of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors about “these threats to safeguarded nuclear facilities,” according to a letter posted by the semiofficial Tasnim news agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N.’s nuclear watchdog said on X it was closely monitoring developments and had seen “no evidence of radiological impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Iran was in a “near-total internet blackout,” advocacy group NetBlocks said, complicating connections with the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-ad0000\" name=\"module-ad0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What we know so far:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-7d1491b0-14a7-11f1-a6a1-61d08433a9e0\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why the U.S. and Israel attacked:&lt;/b&gt; Tensions have soared in recent weeks as American warships moved into the region, and President Donald Trump said he wanted a deal to constrain Iran’s nuclear program. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the joint attack on the nation Israel considers its archenemy was to “remove an existential threat posed” by Iran.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trump’s statement: &lt;/b&gt;He indicated the U.S. was striking for reasons far beyond the nuclear program, listing grievances stretching back to the beginning of the Islamic Republic following a revolution in 1979 that turned Iran from one of America’s closest allies in the Middle East into a fierce foe. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-trump-address-f662a4f3378535d81197be699fb35a3e\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Read what he said in full.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Airspaces are closing:&lt;/b&gt; Iraq and the United Arab Emirates closed their airspace, and sirens sounded in Jordan. Bahrain said that a missile attack targeted the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet headquarters. Explosions also could be heard in Qatar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;World leaders fear broader escalation:&lt;/b&gt; The strikes create a dilemma for the United States’ democratic allies. While European leaders firmly oppose Iran’s nuclear program and crackdowns by its hard-line theocracy, they are loath to embrace unilateral military action by Trump that could breach international law and unleash a broader conflict.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rising tensions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tensions have soared in recent weeks as American warships moved into the region. Trump said he wanted a deal to constrain Iran’s nuclear program at a moment when the country is struggling at home with growing dissent following nationwide protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immediate trigger for Saturday’s strikes appears to be the unsuccessful latest round of nuclear talks. But they also reflect the dramatic changes across the region that have left Iran’s leadership in its weakest position since the Islamic Revolution nearly half a century ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli and American strikes last June greatly weakened Iran’s air defenses, military leadership and nuclear program. A regionwide war, sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, has left Iran’s network of proxies across the Middle East greatly weakened. U.S. sanctions and global isolation, meanwhile, have decimated Iran’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran responded to the latest strikes as it had been threatening to do for months, including by launching missiles and drones targeting Israel as well as strikes targeting U.S. military installations in Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar. “The time has come to defend the homeland and confront the enemy’s military assault,” Iran’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 85 people were reported killed at a girls’ school in southern Iran in the Israeli-U.S. strikes, and dozens others were wounded, according to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency. The White House and the Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flights across the Middle East were disrupted and air defense fire thudded over Dubai, the commercial capital of the United Arab Emirates. Shrapnel from an Iranian missile attack on the capital of the UAE killed one person, state media said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-6e0000\" name=\"module-6e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-da0000\" name=\"image-da0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a64cba1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/90dd4ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d930597/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"President Donald Trump explaining why the United States attacked Iran.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d930597/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d2fe59c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d930597/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump explaining why the United States attacked Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;AP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Trump said&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is President Donald Trump’s sttement on Iran in full:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime. A vicious group of very hard, terrible people. Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas, and our allies throughout the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For 47 years, the Iranian regime has chanted Death to America and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder, targeting the United States, our troops and the innocent people in many, many countries. Among the regime’s very first acts was to back a violent takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, holding dozens of American hostages for 444 days. In 1983, Iran’s proxies carried out the marine barracks bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American military personnel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2000, they knew and were probably involved with the attack on the USS Cole. Many died. Iranian forces killed and maimed hundreds of American service members in Iraq. The regime’s proxies have continued to launch countless attacks against American forces stationed in the Middle East in recent years, as well as U.S. naval and commercial vessels and international shipping lines. It’s been mass terror, and we’re not going to put up with it any longer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Lebanon to Yemen and Syria to Iraq, the regime has armed, trained and funded terrorist militias that have soaked the earth with blood and guts. And it was Iran’s proxy, Hamas, that launched the monstrous Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, slaughtering more than 1,000 innocent people, including 46 Americans, while taking 12 of our citizens hostage. It was brutal, something like the world has never seen before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore. Instead, they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and to continue developing the long range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe, our troops stationed overseas, and could soon reach the American homeland. Just imagine how emboldened this regime would be if they ever had, and actually were armed with nuclear weapons as a means to deliver their message.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For these reasons, the United States military is undertaking a massive and ongoing operation to prevent this very wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests. We’re going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally again obliterated. We’re going to annihilate their navy. We’re going to ensure that the region’s terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region or the world and attack our forces, and no longer use their IEDs, or roadside bombs as they are sometimes called, to so gravely wound and kill thousands and thousands of people, including many Americans. And we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. It’s a very simple message. They will never have a nuclear weapon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces. I built and rebuilt our military in my first administration and there is no military on earth even close to its power, strength or sophistication. My administration is taking every possible step to minimize the risk to U.S. personnel in the region. Even so, and I do not make this statement lightly, the Iranian regime seeks to kill. The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost, and we may have casualties. That often happens in war. But we’re doing this not for now. We’re doing this for the future. And it is a noble mission. We pray for every service member as they selflessly risk their lives to ensure that Americans and our children will never be threatened by a nuclear-armed Iran. We ask God to protect all of our heroes in harm’s way. And we trust that with his help, the men and women of the armed forces will prevail. We have the greatest in the world, and they will prevail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the armed forces and all of the police, I say tonight that you must lay down your weapons and have complete immunity. Or in the alternative, face certain death. So, lay down your arms. You will be treated fairly with total immunity, or you will face certain death. Finally, to the great proud people of Iran, I say tonight that the hour of your freedom is at hand. Stay sheltered. Don’t leave your home. It’s very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere. When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For many years, you have asked for America’s help. But you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want. So let’s see how you respond. America is backing you with overwhelming strength and devastating force. Now is the time to seize control of your destiny, and to unleash the prosperous and glorious future that is close within your reach. This is the moment for action. Do not let it pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May God bless the brave men and women of America’s armed forces. May God bless the United States of America. May God bless you all. Thank you.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Attack was coordinated between Israel and U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacks came after weeks of the U.S. military massing forces in the region even as U.S. and Iranian envoys held talks in Switzerland and Oman aimed at finding a diplomatic solution to head off American military operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, a key mediator in the U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, said in a post on X that he was dismayed that the United States and Israel moved forward with the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Active and serious negotiations have yet again been undermined,” said al-Busaidi, who traveled to Washington on Friday to meet with Vice President JD Vance for talks. “Neither the interests of the United States nor the cause of global peace are well served by this. And I pray for the innocents who will suffer. I urge the United States not to get sucked in further.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel said the operation was carried out as a “broad, coordinated, and joint operation against the regime” that has been planned for months between the Israeli and U.S. militaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, in justifying the military action, claimed that Iran has continued to develop its nuclear program and plans to develop missiles to reach the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also acknowledged that there could be American casualties, saying “that often happens in war.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a notable call on Americans to brace themselves from a U.S. leader who swept into office on an “America First” platform and vowed to keep out of “forever wars” that had bogged down his recent predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s statement indicated the U.S. was striking for reasons far beyond the nuclear program, listing grievances stretching back to the beginning of the Islamic Republic following a revolution in 1979 that turned Iran from one of America’s closest allies in the Middle East into a fierce foe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. president said he was aiming to “annihilate” the Iranian navy and destroy regional proxies supported by Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also called on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to lay down its arms, pledging that members would be given immunity, while warning they would face “certain death” if they didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore,” Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump had threatened military action — but held off — following Iran’s recent crackdown on protests spurred by economic grievances and evolved into a nationwide, anti-government push against the ruling clerics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Human Rights Activists News Agency says it confirmed more than 7,000 deaths in the crackdown and that it is investigating thousands more. The government has acknowledged more than 3,000 killed, though it has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran has said it hasn’t enriched since June, but it has blocked international inspectors from visiting the sites America bombed during a 12-day war then. Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press have shown new activity at two of those sites, suggesting Iran is trying to assess and potentially recover material there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran has a self-imposed limit on its ballistic missile program, limiting their range to 1,240 miles. That puts all the Mideast and some of Eastern Europe in their range. There is no public evidence of Iran seeking to have intercontinental ballistic missiles, though Washington has criticized its space program as potentially allowing it to one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran had hoped to avert a war, but maintains it has the right to enrich uranium and does not want to discuss other issues, like its long-range missile program or support for armed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strikes could also have a huge impact on global markets, particularly if Iran is able to make the Strait of Hormuz unsafe for commercial traffic. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil passed through the strait in 2025, about a third of total worldwide oil exports transported by sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Strikes hit targets across Iran&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iranian media reported strikes nationwide. Roads to Khamenei’s compound in downtown Tehran had been shut down by authorities as other blasts rang out across the capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khamenei has not made a public appearance in recent days and wasn’t immediately seen after. During the 12-day war in June, he was believed to have been taken to a secure location away from his Tehran compound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tehran, witnesses heard the first blast by Khamenei’s office. Iranian state television later reported on the explosion, without offering a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More explosions struck Iran’s capital after Israel said it was attacking the country. Authorities have offered no casualty information from the strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targets in the Israeli campaign included Iran’s military, symbols of government and intelligence targets, according to an official briefed on the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic information on the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Iran retaliates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours after the strikes, Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said it launched a “first wave” of drones and missiles targeting Israel, where a nationwide warning was issued as the military said it was working to intercept incoming Iranian missiles. There was no immediate word on any damage or casualties from the ongoing attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Bahrain said that a missile attack targeted the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet headquarters in the island kingdom. Witnesses heard sirens and explosions in Kuwait, home to U.S. Army Central. Explosions also could be heard in Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq and the United Arab Emirates closed their airspace, and sirens sounded in Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials also reported a drone strike hit a headquarters of the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia in Iraq, killing two people and wounding three Saturday. The group had earlier threatened to enter the fray should Iran come under attack. An Israeli military official said Israel was not aware of any Israeli strikes on Kataib Hezbollah headquarters in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, meanwhile, vowed to resume attacks on Red Sea shipping routes and on Israel, according to two senior Houthi officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no official announcement from the Houthi leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. embassies or consulates in Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Israel posted on social media that they told staffers to shelter in place and recommended all Americans “do the same until further notice.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

All these wars are just for profit,” protesters shouted as others pounded drums to the chants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some carried signs, including a large, red banner that read, “No boots on the ground. No bombs in the air. U.S. out of everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Israel launched a major attack on Iran early Saturday, and President Donald Trump called on the Iranian public to “seize control of your destiny” by rising up against the Islamic leadership that has ruled the nation since 1979. Iran retaliated by firing missiles and drones toward Israel and U.S. military bases in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/nation-world/2026/02/28/iran-trump-israel\"   &gt;Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei died&lt;/a&gt; following a major attack by Israel and the United States, Iranian state media confirmed early Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As reports trickled out about the death, eyewitnesses in Tehran told The Associated Press that some residents were rejoicing, blowing whistles and letting out ululations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, around 100 demonstrators in Chicago who supported the strikes rallied in Daley Plaza, flying American flags and the pre-revolution Iranian flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 200 people were killed on the first day of fighting, including 115 reported dead when a girls’ school was struck. More than 700 were injured in the attacks, according to Iranian state media, citing the Red Crescent. The U.S. military reported no U.S. casualties and minimal damage at U.S. bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Saturday evening's antiwar protest, Ali Tarokh, an Iranian American and refugee rights advocate, said, “The message is simple: Stop this war.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"As an Iranian American who arrived here 13 years ago, I’m telling you, stop this war. This is not Iranian war. We don’t want this war,” Tarokh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and other protesters laid the attacks at the feet of President Trump and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling it “Netanyahu’s playbook.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“War is not the solution,” Tarokh said. “We have problems, we have challenges inside Iran, but it’s our problem, our challenges. We are able, we are mighty, we are strong. … Bombing and striking, war do not bring democracy into our country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters viewed the strikes as a violation of international and U.S. law, and as a punishment for Iran’s support of Gaza in its war with Israel. They repeatedly called for U.S. divestment from Israel and military attacks, arguing that funding should be diverted to health care and education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-4a0000\" name=\"image-4a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c2dc159/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F2d%2Fe5973d0c4d3c913f3d95ac3356b4%2Fprotest-26301-03.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8079297/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F2d%2Fe5973d0c4d3c913f3d95ac3356b4%2Fprotest-26301-03.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24efc92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F2d%2Fe5973d0c4d3c913f3d95ac3356b4%2Fprotest-26301-03.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"PROTEST_26301-03.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24efc92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F2d%2Fe5973d0c4d3c913f3d95ac3356b4%2Fprotest-26301-03.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9908950/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F2d%2Fe5973d0c4d3c913f3d95ac3356b4%2Fprotest-26301-03.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24efc92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F07%2F2d%2Fe5973d0c4d3c913f3d95ac3356b4%2Fprotest-26301-03.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protesters call for an end to the U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran during a demonstration in Federal Plaza in the Loop, Saturday, Feb. 28, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giacomo Cain/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The people of this country do not want another forever war,” said Yusuf Masood, a member of the Anti-War Committee of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While millions here can barely afford to get by on a daily basis, forced to work long and arduous hours with little government support, the very same government sends billions of dollars abroad to support war on Iran and Israel’s crimes against Palestine,” Masood said. “We must stand resolutely in solidarity with the people of Iran, who only want to live free from becoming another vassal state of the U.S. empire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois' Democratic leaders also criticized the attacks, claiming Trump carried them out without congressional approval. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration had briefed several Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress in advance of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No justification, no authorization from Congress, and no clear objective. But none of that matters to Donald Trump — and apparently neither do the safety and lives of American service members,\" Gov. JB Pritzker said in a social media post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizers from the U.S. Palestinian Community Network, Anti-War Committee and two dozen more organizations arranged Saturday’s demonstration, which lasted nearly two hours after protesters marched from Federal Plaza to Trump Tower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organizations planned another protest for 5:30 p.m. Monday at Ida B. Wells Drive and Michigan Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contributing:&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Associated Press&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
