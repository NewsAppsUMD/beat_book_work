Simmons asks if she's on the phone with the police, but she doesn't respond and continues speaking to the person on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I'm not going to argue,\" Simmons says in the video. \"I'm gonna let you know that it is against the law to call the police on an elected official who's knocking doors, I know because I passed the law in 2021. So if you'd like me to leave the building, I would leave the building, but I am so disappointed in how you chose to handle the situation at a time when police have been known to get into deadly altercations with people of color.

They saw a truck parked in the intersection and a man with a gun running toward them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man pointed his gun through the car window and yelled at them in Spanish. Pizer and his group got out with the man pointing his gun in Pizer’s face The man then got into the driver’s seat and maneuvered the car to block the street and parked it. Seconds later, the vehicle went up in flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before we knew it, our rental car and the truck were in flames,” Pizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pizer, a former Illinois state representative who now works for U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley, watched as the man got onto a city bus and fired shots in the air, ordering people off the bus. The bus was soon set ablaze, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the commotion, Pizer sent frantic texts to friends back at his condo nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-350000\" name=\"image-350000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4047cc2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ea44e2d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/725c919/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Yoni Pizer, 2020 Illinois House 12th District Democratic primary election candidate.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/725c919/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/705b334/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/725c919/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan “Yoni” Pizer was on his way to watch whales in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on Sunday when an armed cartel member seized his car at gunpoint and set it on fire.

He and a friend got separated from their husbands. A stranger told them to get in his car and drove them to the beach, which remained placid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People [were] doing yoga and jogging and riding bikes,” Pizer said. “No one knew what had just begun, and I did my best to tell people that there was a terrorist attack going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pizer and his friend walked along the beach back to their condo; their husbands took shelter in an orphanage at a nearby church. They stayed there for eight hours until the violence died down and they could return to the condo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Instability in Jalisco&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos circulating on social media showed smoke over the tourist city of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco and people sprinting through the airport of the state's capital in panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of American, Canadian, Mexican and international airlines canceled flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Guadalajara, which is scheduled to host matches during this summer's soccer World Cup, burning vehicles blocked roads and businesses closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-580000\" name=\"image-580000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/663ef61/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2F94%2Fbeecad184486aa77d72f09f240af%2F2262734563.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a745f8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2F94%2Fbeecad184486aa77d72f09f240af%2F2262734563.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/669a9fa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2F94%2Fbeecad184486aa77d72f09f240af%2F2262734563.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Burned cars are seen in the parking lot of a Costco retail store in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco state, Mexico, on February 23, 2026.

Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus told residents to stay at home, suspended public transportation and said the state was “living through critical hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumors circulated on social media that violence could continue and utilities could be shut off. But as Pizer and his party waited anxiously, calm prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ongoings of terror that we were worried about overnight, none of that came to pass,” Pizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pizer surmised that the goal of the violence was to communicate to the government that the cartel could take a certain level of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They really were about sending a message, we believe, to the government that they could turn on and turn off violence at a whim,” Pizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: “If they had wanted to kill people, we would have been among the first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pizer expressed concern about what the news will do for the area’s reputation, as much of Puerto Vallarta is dependent on tourism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We really want things to return to just the wonderful place that so many people know that it is,” Pizer said. “It really deserves our support and, frankly, going forward, our loyalty.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Disrupted wedding plans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In preparation for their wedding in Guadalajara on Friday, Kaitlin Bucaro and Robbie Morris were sitting at a Chicago coffee shop writing their wedding vows Sunday morning when they heard from a guest who had traveled to Mexico earlier that her flight was rerouted and couldn’t land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple read and watched news coming out of Guadalajara and within hours knew they’d have to cancel the 150-guest wedding they had spent a year — and thousands of dollars — planning. They were set to fly to Mexico on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This situation that’s happening is not necessarily in these contracts with these vendors,” Bucaro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think very quickly we realized what was going on there was bigger than this wedding and bringing a bunch of people,” she said. “We needed to look out for everybody’s safety, including our own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple is “gutted,” Morris added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ve made friends in Guadalajara over several trips there the past few years.

After thousands of votes were cast, \"Abolish ICE\" was named as one of the winners in the city's \"You Name a Snowplow\" contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the Department of Streets and Sanitation announced the six winning names for the fourth annual snowplow-naming contest. They were pulled from more than 13,300 entries and 39,000 voters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top six snowplow names that received the most votes also included \"Stephen Coldbert,\" \"Pope Frío XIV,\" \"The Blizzard of Oz,\" \"Svencoolie\" and \"Caleb Chilliams.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Chance the Scraper\" received an honorable mention after it finished just .24% out of the top six, according to a city news release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I want to thank the people of Chicago for their unmatched creativity, sense of humor and civic pride,\" Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a news release. \"We are grateful and inspired by the record-breaking participation in the contest this year.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An overwhelming number of Chicagoans voted for \"Abolish ICE\" in the run-up to Monday's announcement. According to a list of all submissions &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/01/snowplow-name-contest-streets-sanitation-ice\"   &gt;provided to the Sun-Times&lt;/a&gt;, the slogan had been entered roughly 9,300 times by late January, making up about 70% of entries.

He failed to finish the first inning after racking up 25 pitches to six batters in the Sox’ 5-4 loss to the Rockies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he knows exactly where he stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘He understands that he’s a dude on this team,’’ manager &lt;b&gt;Will Venable&lt;/b&gt; said. ‘‘Last year, he came trying to prove he was a dude on this team. Going through that year, the expectations change for him now. But there’s the added obligation of being a leader on this club. Guys look at him and follow his lead. He’s somebody who is going to take that challenge on.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge Monday for Smith, who hit two batters, walked one and allowed three runs (two earned) and two hits, was throwing strikes. After pitching a complete second inning, he recalled being bad in his first start last spring before impressing during the rest of camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith would go on to make 29 starts for the Sox and finished 7-8 with a 3.81 ERA and 145 strikeouts in 146⅓ innings. Posting a 2.37 ERA in his first 13 starts helped him build a case to become the lone All-Star representative on what would be a 102-loss team. He also became the second Rule 5 player, along with second baseman &lt;b&gt;Dan Uggla&lt;/b&gt; in 2006, to make an All-Star team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring feels different to him, knowing he doesn’t have to impress every time out to win a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s nerves, it’s mechanics, it’s moving at game speed for the first time in a while,’’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘The pressure on yourself is different. Every day still matters, obviously. But it’s just what I want to work on today that’s going to set me up better for maybe five weeks from now, six weeks from now, rather than my next outing has to be perfect in order to do it.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Montgomery scratched&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortstop &lt;b&gt;Colson Montgomery&lt;/b&gt; was scratched because of illness, Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘He went out there and got his workout in,’’ Venable said. ‘‘Just not feeling well. He’s out with an illness. He wanted to play. We thought at this time in the year [it was] just better to let him get hydrated and recover.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will loves William&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;William Bergolla Jr&lt;/b&gt;., who made a flashy impression last spring before&lt;br&gt;batting .286/.342/.333 with no home runs and 40 stolen bases at Double-A Birmingham, had a start at shortstop fall into his lap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I don’t know if I’m supposed to say this, but he’s one of our favorites,’’ Venable said. ‘‘He’s a guy last year that we were really excited to have him come over. It seemed like he made every single play, got big hits, great defensively and just has an incredible feel for the game. Really excited he’s in camp with us now.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bergolla added weight and, perhaps, some power during the offseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘That is something that’s going to be huge for him because he really does everything else really well,’’ Venable said. ‘‘Just has to add a little more pop in there. But he’s a fun one to watch.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ROCKIES 5, SOX 4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zac Veen’s&lt;/b&gt; 468-foot walk-off home run against left-hander &lt;b&gt;Shane Murphy &lt;/b&gt;handed the Sox (3-1) their first loss of the spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Japanese slugger &lt;b&gt;Munetaka Murakami&lt;/b&gt;, whose strikeout rate in each of his last three seasons overseas approached 30%, struck out his first two times up before notching a single and an opposite-field double as he prepares for the World Baseball Classic.

Hitters are timing the not-so-rare-anymore velocity with rising competence. Therein lies the emphasis on equally valuable — or even more valuable — tools for pitchers: fastball command and keeping hitters off-balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor, 23, has known this for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Nowadays, the best starters and relievers throw 100-plus, but every single one of the best starters has five or six pitch mixes,’’ Taylor told the Sun-Times on Monday. ‘‘So it shows that the game is adjusting to the velo. The hitters are getting a little better, so you have to have more options to get guys out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘[Tigers ace Tarik] Skubal hit 103 last year, and he’s still got a great pitch mix. Velo in short stints can carry you through an outing. But for long-term success, you need some other pitches.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor featured a four-seam fastball, curve, slider, cutter and changeup last season. This spring, he’s introducing a two-seam fastball that runs away from left-handers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drafted in the second round out of LSU in 2023, Taylor posted a 1.01 ERA in 15 outings last season at Double-A Birmingham before breaking into the majors. He made 36 appearances with the Sox (34 of them in relief) and posted an unremarkable 4.91 ERA. But he struck out 54 batters and walked 15 in 36⅔ innings and finished well, allowing no runs in his last 10 outings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting might be in Taylor’s future — that’s his desire — but he will earn his big-league chops in the back of the Sox’ bullpen for now, likely with multi-inning assignments. He pitched a perfect inning Monday, striking out two Rockies and throwing 10 of his 12 pitches for strikes. Three pitches hit 100 mph and two others 99.6 and 99.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor’s live batting-practice sessions have been must-see events early in camp. He didn’t disappoint last week, striking our four consecutive batters and breaking teammate Andrew Benintendi’s bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s gross,’’ Benintendi said of Taylor’s arsenal. ‘‘He has the 100-plus fastball, but he’s worked on some stuff in the offseason that will make him even more effective.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of the positive vibes simmering around shortstop Colson Montgomery’s rookie breakthrough last season, a promising young catching core and the signing of free-agent Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami, whether general manager Chris Getz’s rebuild can emerge from the muck of three consecutive 100-loss seasons largely hinges on quality pitching depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The master plan envisions Taylor being part of a contending staff, perhaps in the starting rotation with lefty prospects Noah Schultz and Hagen Smith, who are expected to make their big-league debuts this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We’ve had conversations about how that might play out in the future, but at this time I’m solely focused on doing the best I can in the pen,’’ Taylor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Any innings in the big leagues are fun. I enjoyed [the bullpen] last year, and I anticipate I’ll enjoy it again this year.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListL\" data-module  data-hide-authors=\"true\"

Be compassionate. Do some internal and external housecleaning. &lt;/p&gt;",

They come as WGN parent company Nexstar is working to merge with Tegna in a deal that’s under regulatory review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nexstar spokesperson said in a statement to the Sun-Times: “Nexstar does not comment on personnel issues, but the company is taking steps necessary to compete effectively in this period of unprecedented change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The layoffs are an apparent effort to cut costs in anticipation of the excessive debt Nexstar will incur from money borrowed to buy Tegna. WGN is still very profitable, despite changes in viewing habits, but the cuts have to come from somewhere, through no fault of the employees affected. Nexstar already has been carrying the debt from its $4.1 billion purchase of Tribune Media in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratings-wise, WGN News performs great in the morning, dominates Fox 32 at 9 p.m. and is competitive at 10. Its popular morning-news show is emulated by other stations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;",
