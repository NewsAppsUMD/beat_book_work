Simmons asks if she's on the phone with the police, but she doesn't respond and continues speaking to the person on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I'm not going to argue,\" Simmons says in the video. \"I'm gonna let you know that it is against the law to call the police on an elected official who's knocking doors, I know because I passed the law in 2021. So if you'd like me to leave the building, I would leave the building, but I am so disappointed in how you chose to handle the situation at a time when police have been known to get into deadly altercations with people of color.

They saw a truck parked in the intersection and a man with a gun running toward them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man pointed his gun through the car window and yelled at them in Spanish. Pizer and his group got out with the man pointing his gun in Pizer’s face The man then got into the driver’s seat and maneuvered the car to block the street and parked it. Seconds later, the vehicle went up in flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before we knew it, our rental car and the truck were in flames,” Pizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pizer, a former Illinois state representative who now works for U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley, watched as the man got onto a city bus and fired shots in the air, ordering people off the bus. The bus was soon set ablaze, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the commotion, Pizer sent frantic texts to friends back at his condo nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-350000\" name=\"image-350000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4047cc2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ea44e2d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/725c919/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Yoni Pizer, 2020 Illinois House 12th District Democratic primary election candidate.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/725c919/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/705b334/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/725c919/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan “Yoni” Pizer was on his way to watch whales in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on Sunday when an armed cartel member seized his car at gunpoint and set it on fire.

He and a friend got separated from their husbands. A stranger told them to get in his car and drove them to the beach, which remained placid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People [were] doing yoga and jogging and riding bikes,” Pizer said. “No one knew what had just begun, and I did my best to tell people that there was a terrorist attack going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pizer and his friend walked along the beach back to their condo; their husbands took shelter in an orphanage at a nearby church. They stayed there for eight hours until the violence died down and they could return to the condo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Instability in Jalisco&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos circulating on social media showed smoke over the tourist city of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco and people sprinting through the airport of the state's capital in panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of American, Canadian, Mexican and international airlines canceled flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Guadalajara, which is scheduled to host matches during this summer's soccer World Cup, burning vehicles blocked roads and businesses closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-580000\" name=\"image-580000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/663ef61/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2F94%2Fbeecad184486aa77d72f09f240af%2F2262734563.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a745f8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2F94%2Fbeecad184486aa77d72f09f240af%2F2262734563.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/669a9fa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2F94%2Fbeecad184486aa77d72f09f240af%2F2262734563.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Burned cars are seen in the parking lot of a Costco retail store in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco state, Mexico, on February 23, 2026.

Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus told residents to stay at home, suspended public transportation and said the state was “living through critical hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumors circulated on social media that violence could continue and utilities could be shut off. But as Pizer and his party waited anxiously, calm prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ongoings of terror that we were worried about overnight, none of that came to pass,” Pizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pizer surmised that the goal of the violence was to communicate to the government that the cartel could take a certain level of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They really were about sending a message, we believe, to the government that they could turn on and turn off violence at a whim,” Pizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: “If they had wanted to kill people, we would have been among the first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pizer expressed concern about what the news will do for the area’s reputation, as much of Puerto Vallarta is dependent on tourism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We really want things to return to just the wonderful place that so many people know that it is,” Pizer said. “It really deserves our support and, frankly, going forward, our loyalty.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Disrupted wedding plans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In preparation for their wedding in Guadalajara on Friday, Kaitlin Bucaro and Robbie Morris were sitting at a Chicago coffee shop writing their wedding vows Sunday morning when they heard from a guest who had traveled to Mexico earlier that her flight was rerouted and couldn’t land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple read and watched news coming out of Guadalajara and within hours knew they’d have to cancel the 150-guest wedding they had spent a year — and thousands of dollars — planning. They were set to fly to Mexico on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This situation that’s happening is not necessarily in these contracts with these vendors,” Bucaro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think very quickly we realized what was going on there was bigger than this wedding and bringing a bunch of people,” she said. “We needed to look out for everybody’s safety, including our own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple is “gutted,” Morris added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ve made friends in Guadalajara over several trips there the past few years.

After thousands of votes were cast, \"Abolish ICE\" was named as one of the winners in the city's \"You Name a Snowplow\" contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the Department of Streets and Sanitation announced the six winning names for the fourth annual snowplow-naming contest. They were pulled from more than 13,300 entries and 39,000 voters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top six snowplow names that received the most votes also included \"Stephen Coldbert,\" \"Pope Frío XIV,\" \"The Blizzard of Oz,\" \"Svencoolie\" and \"Caleb Chilliams.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Chance the Scraper\" received an honorable mention after it finished just .24% out of the top six, according to a city news release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I want to thank the people of Chicago for their unmatched creativity, sense of humor and civic pride,\" Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a news release. \"We are grateful and inspired by the record-breaking participation in the contest this year.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An overwhelming number of Chicagoans voted for \"Abolish ICE\" in the run-up to Monday's announcement. According to a list of all submissions &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/01/snowplow-name-contest-streets-sanitation-ice\"   &gt;provided to the Sun-Times&lt;/a&gt;, the slogan had been entered roughly 9,300 times by late January, making up about 70% of entries.

He failed to finish the first inning after racking up 25 pitches to six batters in the Sox’ 5-4 loss to the Rockies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he knows exactly where he stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘He understands that he’s a dude on this team,’’ manager &lt;b&gt;Will Venable&lt;/b&gt; said. ‘‘Last year, he came trying to prove he was a dude on this team. Going through that year, the expectations change for him now. But there’s the added obligation of being a leader on this club. Guys look at him and follow his lead. He’s somebody who is going to take that challenge on.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge Monday for Smith, who hit two batters, walked one and allowed three runs (two earned) and two hits, was throwing strikes. After pitching a complete second inning, he recalled being bad in his first start last spring before impressing during the rest of camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith would go on to make 29 starts for the Sox and finished 7-8 with a 3.81 ERA and 145 strikeouts in 146⅓ innings. Posting a 2.37 ERA in his first 13 starts helped him build a case to become the lone All-Star representative on what would be a 102-loss team. He also became the second Rule 5 player, along with second baseman &lt;b&gt;Dan Uggla&lt;/b&gt; in 2006, to make an All-Star team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring feels different to him, knowing he doesn’t have to impress every time out to win a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s nerves, it’s mechanics, it’s moving at game speed for the first time in a while,’’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘The pressure on yourself is different. Every day still matters, obviously. But it’s just what I want to work on today that’s going to set me up better for maybe five weeks from now, six weeks from now, rather than my next outing has to be perfect in order to do it.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Montgomery scratched&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortstop &lt;b&gt;Colson Montgomery&lt;/b&gt; was scratched because of illness, Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘He went out there and got his workout in,’’ Venable said. ‘‘Just not feeling well. He’s out with an illness. He wanted to play. We thought at this time in the year [it was] just better to let him get hydrated and recover.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will loves William&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;William Bergolla Jr&lt;/b&gt;., who made a flashy impression last spring before&lt;br&gt;batting .286/.342/.333 with no home runs and 40 stolen bases at Double-A Birmingham, had a start at shortstop fall into his lap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I don’t know if I’m supposed to say this, but he’s one of our favorites,’’ Venable said. ‘‘He’s a guy last year that we were really excited to have him come over. It seemed like he made every single play, got big hits, great defensively and just has an incredible feel for the game. Really excited he’s in camp with us now.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bergolla added weight and, perhaps, some power during the offseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘That is something that’s going to be huge for him because he really does everything else really well,’’ Venable said. ‘‘Just has to add a little more pop in there. But he’s a fun one to watch.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ROCKIES 5, SOX 4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zac Veen’s&lt;/b&gt; 468-foot walk-off home run against left-hander &lt;b&gt;Shane Murphy &lt;/b&gt;handed the Sox (3-1) their first loss of the spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Japanese slugger &lt;b&gt;Munetaka Murakami&lt;/b&gt;, whose strikeout rate in each of his last three seasons overseas approached 30%, struck out his first two times up before notching a single and an opposite-field double as he prepares for the World Baseball Classic.

Hitters are timing the not-so-rare-anymore velocity with rising competence. Therein lies the emphasis on equally valuable — or even more valuable — tools for pitchers: fastball command and keeping hitters off-balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor, 23, has known this for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Nowadays, the best starters and relievers throw 100-plus, but every single one of the best starters has five or six pitch mixes,’’ Taylor told the Sun-Times on Monday. ‘‘So it shows that the game is adjusting to the velo. The hitters are getting a little better, so you have to have more options to get guys out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘[Tigers ace Tarik] Skubal hit 103 last year, and he’s still got a great pitch mix. Velo in short stints can carry you through an outing. But for long-term success, you need some other pitches.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor featured a four-seam fastball, curve, slider, cutter and changeup last season. This spring, he’s introducing a two-seam fastball that runs away from left-handers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drafted in the second round out of LSU in 2023, Taylor posted a 1.01 ERA in 15 outings last season at Double-A Birmingham before breaking into the majors. He made 36 appearances with the Sox (34 of them in relief) and posted an unremarkable 4.91 ERA. But he struck out 54 batters and walked 15 in 36⅔ innings and finished well, allowing no runs in his last 10 outings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting might be in Taylor’s future — that’s his desire — but he will earn his big-league chops in the back of the Sox’ bullpen for now, likely with multi-inning assignments. He pitched a perfect inning Monday, striking out two Rockies and throwing 10 of his 12 pitches for strikes. Three pitches hit 100 mph and two others 99.6 and 99.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor’s live batting-practice sessions have been must-see events early in camp. He didn’t disappoint last week, striking our four consecutive batters and breaking teammate Andrew Benintendi’s bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s gross,’’ Benintendi said of Taylor’s arsenal. ‘‘He has the 100-plus fastball, but he’s worked on some stuff in the offseason that will make him even more effective.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of the positive vibes simmering around shortstop Colson Montgomery’s rookie breakthrough last season, a promising young catching core and the signing of free-agent Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami, whether general manager Chris Getz’s rebuild can emerge from the muck of three consecutive 100-loss seasons largely hinges on quality pitching depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The master plan envisions Taylor being part of a contending staff, perhaps in the starting rotation with lefty prospects Noah Schultz and Hagen Smith, who are expected to make their big-league debuts this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We’ve had conversations about how that might play out in the future, but at this time I’m solely focused on doing the best I can in the pen,’’ Taylor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Any innings in the big leagues are fun. I enjoyed [the bullpen] last year, and I anticipate I’ll enjoy it again this year.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListL\" data-module  data-hide-authors=\"true\"

They come as WGN parent company Nexstar is working to merge with Tegna in a deal that’s under regulatory review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nexstar spokesperson said in a statement to the Sun-Times: “Nexstar does not comment on personnel issues, but the company is taking steps necessary to compete effectively in this period of unprecedented change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The layoffs are an apparent effort to cut costs in anticipation of the excessive debt Nexstar will incur from money borrowed to buy Tegna. WGN is still very profitable, despite changes in viewing habits, but the cuts have to come from somewhere, through no fault of the employees affected. Nexstar already has been carrying the debt from its $4.1 billion purchase of Tribune Media in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratings-wise, WGN News performs great in the morning, dominates Fox 32 at 9 p.m. and is competitive at 10. Its popular morning-news show is emulated by other stations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;",

Usually, we manage fine, but a current conflict may push me over the edge. \"Lauren\" lives alone with dogs that seem to be her only family. One of them (age 11) had been sick. She kept asking for sick leave to take him to the vet. I told her she had to use vacation time for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, the dog died, and now Lauren wants to take bereavement leave. When I refused, she had a fit and started yelling about unequal treatment because another co-worker, \"Jenny,\" was allowed to take bereavement leave earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenny's toddler son died in a drowning accident. It was a horrific tragedy. Jenny was traumatized and incapacitated for weeks. The situations are not comparable. But Jenny heard Lauren yelling and comparing Jenny's child to her elderly basset hound. This is causing all sorts of interpersonal problems that HR has flatly refused to get involved with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand that Lauren loved her dog, but I also think she needs to get a grip, apologize to Jenny and take a vacation if she needs to. Is it unreasonable to expect an adult to know the difference between a human and a dog and act accordingly? — &lt;i&gt;STRESSED SUPERVISOR IN CALIFORNIA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR SUPERVISOR:&lt;/b&gt; I think you already know the answer to your rather snarky question. HR at your firm may be reluctant to handle this hot potato because they do not have a policy in place that covers pet illness or bereavement for the loss of one. Please suggest it to your employer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My wife and I are seniors and live in a one-floor condominium. I am in good health, but she has several medical issues, including impaired balance and mobility. She refuses the recommended physical therapy and rarely uses the walker I bought for her. She hates cooking now and wants me to drive almost daily for takeout, which is expensive and time-consuming. Now, she's talking about selling our condominium to move into a seniors' complex with independent, assisted and continuing care phases. All meals are prepared there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not want this move and have told her so. When I do, she goes silent for days, telling me it's time for the change. I disagree. We are at an impasse. I am so upset about this I am considering divorce after 55 years. What do you recommend we do? — &lt;i&gt;STILL YOUNG IN NORTH CAROLINA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR STILL YOUNG:&lt;/b&gt; I recommend you discuss this with your CPA and your attorney before making any decisions. If you could afford it, an assisted living facility for her while you remain in the condo might be ideal. However, if that's not possible, would you be willing to send her to the facility while you rent a one-bedroom apartment for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I am pretty sure of: Your wife is signaling that she's shutting down. Her world is now smaller than it was. You haven't aged at the same rate, and it may be time to do for her what you would like her to do for you if the situation were reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Lo que es normal hoy en las comunidades mayoritariamente latinas de la ciudad no es lo que era antes del Operativo Midway Blitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El lado sureste, definido durante mucho tiempo por fábricas de acero y comunidades de clase trabajadora, fue uno de los primeros lugares a los que llegaron los mexicanos cuando llegaron a Chicago hace más de un siglo. En el lado oeste, conocido como el Lower West Side, Pilsen destaca por sus coloridos murales, su rica escena artística y culinaria, y su vibrante cultura chicana. Un poco más al suroeste, La Villita, cuenta con un vibrante corredor comercial y celebraciones comunitarias, como el desfile del Día de la Independencia Mexicana, que están entre los más antiguos y grandes del Medio Oeste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estos vecindarios trazaron caminos separados para convertirse en centros culturales mayoritariamente latinos para las comunidades mexicanas en Chicago. Pero compartieron una experiencia común el otoño pasado: el Operativo Midway Blitz de la administración de Trump. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/live/2025/09/16/cbp-raids-ice-chicago-elgin-operation-at-large\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;La campaña de aplicación de la ley de inmigración comenzó el 16 de septiembre,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Día de la Independencia Mexicana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los funcionarios federales dijeron que el operativo se enfocó en criminales violentos sin estatus legal, aunque &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/03/28/tren-de-aragua-venezuela-gang-trump-tom-homan-terrorism-violence-crime-chicago-colombia-honduras-ecuador-nicolas-maduro-salvador\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;esto resultó ser en gran medida falso&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A medida que aumentó la aplicación de la ley de inmigración, el miedo se extendió por Chicago y sus suburbios. Los vecindarios de mayoría latina e inmigrante, incluyendo Pilsen, La Villita y el lado sureste, entraron en alerta máxima.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estas comunidades desarrollaron su identidad latina a lo largo de generaciones, formadas por la migración, el trabajo y el desplazamiento. Los operativos de inmigración dirigidos por Trump crearon un momento compartido en sus historias, un momento lleno de miedo, incertidumbre y orgullo comunitario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        &lt;bsp-carousel class=\"Carousel Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"gallery-overview\" name=\"gallery-overview\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slides\"&gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slide\"&gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-media\"&gt;\n        \n            \n                \n                    &lt;picture data-crop=\"large\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/016e7ca/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1982+0+7/resize/840x555!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F8d%2Fecc640ab430bba904f833a745188%2Flvprotest-102625-13.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a79284/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1982+0+7/resize/1680x1110!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F8d%2Fecc640ab430bba904f833a745188%2Flvprotest-102625-13.jpg 2x\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/097d8a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1982+0+7/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F8d%2Fecc640ab430bba904f833a745188%2Flvprotest-102625-13.jpg\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"LVPROTEST-102625-13.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/097d8a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1982+0+7/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F8d%2Fecc640ab430bba904f833a745188%2Flvprotest-102625-13.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/38c676a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1982+0+7/resize/1680x1110!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F8d%2Fecc640ab430bba904f833a745188%2Flvprotest-102625-13.jpg 2x\" width=\"840\" height=\"555\"\n        src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/097d8a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1982+0+7/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F8d%2Fecc640ab430bba904f833a745188%2Flvprotest-102625-13.jpg\"&gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n                \n            \n        \n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-info\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-infoTitle\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-infoDescription\"&gt;Protesters march westbound on 26th Street in Little Village over recent federal law enforcement raids in the Chicago area, as part of Operation Midway Blitz, Saturday, Oct. 25, 2025.&lt;/span&gt;\n            \n            \n                &lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-pipe\"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-infoAttribution\"&gt;Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-pagination\"&gt;\n            &lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-currentSlide\"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

a principios de 1900. Muchos llegaron en 1919, cuando fueron reclutados durante una huelga nacional de fábricas de acero. Estas comunidades se convirtieron en parte de la columna vertebral del área industrial de South Chicago y el lado este, creando una identidad que perdura hasta hoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En 1923, la comunidad estableció la Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, la primera parroquia mexicoestadounidense en la ciudad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A partir de 2023, los latinos en el lado este y South Chicago representaban la mitad de los 52,000 residentes de los vecindarios, según la Agencia Metropolitana de Planeación de Chicago. El lado este solo es casi 90% latino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Historias de South Chicago y el lado sureste&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sc-masa\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Molino de Masa de Cecy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sc-maria\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;María&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#ses-natg\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Miembro de la Guardia Nacional de Illinois&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sc-pedraza\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Corina Pedraza&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#ses-bautista\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Olga Bautista&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"pilsen-top\" name=\"pilsen-top\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c107295/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/efbfe2a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53a3f35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"María Ruiz y Rita se sientan sobre un auto en el Desfile del Día de la Independencia de México mientras avanza en 91st Street en el lado sureste el 15 de septiembre de 1957.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53a3f35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2efd0e4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53a3f35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;María Ruiz y Rita se sientan sobre un auto en el Desfile del Día de la Independencia de México mientras avanza en 91st Street en el lado sureste el 15 de septiembre de 1957.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southeast Chicago Historical Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pilsen&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antes de que Pilsen se conociera por su identidad mexicana y mexicoamericana —con sus calles llenas de murales coloridos, tiendas y restaurantes mexicanos— el vecindario fue hogar de olas de inmigrantes europeos. Nombrada en honor a Plzeň, en lo que hoy es la República Checa, Pilsen comenzó a cambiar a mediados del siglo XX cuando las familias mexicanas y puertorriqueñas se mudaron, muchas desplazadas del lado oeste cercano debido a la construcción de autopistas y la expansión del campus de la Universidad de Illinois en Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Para la década de 1960, Pilsen se había convertido en predominantemente latino, modelada por el activismo social, el compromiso cívico y la expresión artística. Hoy, Pilsen es 68% latino e hispano, según datos del Censo de Estados Unidos. En los últimos años, el aumento en los costos de vivienda y el nuevo desarrollo han suscitado preocupaciones sobre la gentrificación y el desplazamiento de los residentes de muchos años.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Historias de Pilsen y el lado suroeste&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#pils-alejandra\"   &gt;Alejandra&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sw-progresando\"   &gt;Latinos Progresando&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"lv-top\" name=\"lv-top\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a5c4ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/777bfd5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49a8def/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mexican students protest at Froebel school in 1973.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49a8def/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4529303/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49a8def/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexican students protest at the Froebel Branch of Harrison High School at 2021 W. 21st St. in Chicago, May 5, 1973.

En 1990, el gobierno mexicano donó el arco de La Villita, consolidando la identidad del vecindario. Dice “Bienvenidos a Little Village”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El vecindario estaba orgulloso de sus raíces. Muchos comenzaron a llamar a La Villita “el México del Medio Oeste”. Los últimos datos del Censo de Estados Unidos muestran que South Lawndale, aún el nombre oficial del área, es 81% latino e hispano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El corredor entre Pilsen y La Villita tiene ahora la mayor concentración de latinos en el Medio Oeste. El corredor comercial de la calle 26 de La Villita genera millones en ingresos anuales y es el segundo distrito generador de impuestos más alto de la ciudad, después de la Milla Magnífica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Historias de La Villita&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#lv-viento\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Viento, el club de corredores&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#lv-morenos\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Licorería Moreno’s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"  data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-6e0000\" name=\"image-6e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b0e00db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/51731da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e14a6c4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"En 1983, Rudy Lozano, un activista comunitario mexicoestadounidense que fue fundamental en la campaña para la elección de Harold Washington como alcalde, fue asesinado en su hogar tras la victoria de Washington.

Hacia el final del operativo, el 10 de noviembre, docenas de agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza posaron en el centro de la ciudad frente a “El Frijol”. Mientras se preparaban para tomar la foto, un agente supuestamente dijo: “¡Todos digan ‘La Villita’!”. Según informes de los medios, los agentes gritaron de vuelta: “¡La Villita!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entre tanto, los agentes federales &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2025/11/06/tengo-papeles-maestra-es-detenida-por-agentes-de-inmigracion-en-guarderia-de-chicago\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;interrumpieron la vida diaria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, particularmente en lugares como La Villita, Pilsen y el lado sureste. Inmigrantes y otros habitantes de Chicago temían ser detenidos mientras caminaban por la calle, esperaban el autobús o llevaban a sus hijos a la escuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En algunos vecindarios, las calles estaban vacías. Los propietarios de negocios vieron drásticas caídas en las ventas. Algunos temían tener que cerrar. Los eventos comunitarios y algunos desfiles fueron cancelados.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los vecindarios conocidos por su vitalidad y vida comunitaria unida estaban en silencio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Las familias temían la separación, y los padres se preocupaban por el impacto a largo plazo en sus hijos. Críticos de los operativos de inmigración señalaron tácticas violentas, operativos performativos y detenciones inconstitucionales. Los partidarios dijeron que el gobierno federal estaba apuntando a inmigrantes violentos y peligrosos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Según documentos del Departamento de Justicia, 97% de los detenidos durante el Operativo Midway Blitz no tenían antecedentes criminales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La administración de Trump continuó impulsando la narrativa de que estaba sacando a asesinos y violadores de las calles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Después de que los agentes posaron en “El Frijol”, comenzaron a salir de Chicago. El aflujo federal de unos 300 agentes para el Operativo Midway Blitz terminó. Pero la aplicación de la ley de inmigración de ICE —Inmigración y Control de Aduanas— continúa.

Villita, sólo se comunicaban entre ellos para cancelar una carrera. Ahora se envían mensajes para verificar si ha habido avistamientos de agentes federales y luego decidir cuándo correrán y por qué ruta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Normalmente estoy verificando, ‘¿Cómo están todos personalmente?’ pero también, ‘¿Qué piensan sobre correr hoy? ¿Qué es algo en lo que deberíamos estar atentos?’”, dice Jess Vergara, de 37 años, quien fue parte del grupo que creó el club hace 13 años. “Así que estamos preparados cuando surgen las cosas”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El club tiene una nueva regla: nadie puede correr solo. Vergara dice que los corredores disminuirán la velocidad o regresarán para asegurarse de que nadie esté demasiado lejos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El club es mayormente latino y corre tres veces a la semana, reuniéndose en 26th Street y South Central Park Avenue, como lo han hecho durante 13 años.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los residentes los reconocen. Los dueños de negocios los saludan a su paso y los miembros suelen reunirse después de las carreras en restaurantes para tomar café.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los agentes federales de inmigración llegaron en septiembre, aproximadamente un mes antes del Maratón de Chicago. Para muchos corredores, no correr no era una opción después de semanas de entrenamiento.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vergara y los otros capitanes querían mantener a los corredores seguros. Trazaron rutas y paradas de agua; identificaron refugios seguros en caso de que los agentes los abordaran. Los miembros proporcionaron contactos de emergencia en caso de que algún corredor fuera detenido. El club llevó a cabo capacitaciones sobre Conoce tus Derechos para los corredores y sus familias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahora, dice Vergara, están tratando de mantener motivados a los corredores, pero también se están preparando en caso de que los federales regresen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estamos constantemente revisando las noticias, qué están haciendo otras organizaciones en La Villita y alrededor de Chicago”, dice. “Mantenemos contacto con los equipos de respuesta rápida y vemos qué están diciendo”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Es un sentimiento tan diferente.

inmigración. Los clientes han comenzado a regresar, “pero la gente tiene esta inquietud”, dice el dueño de la tienda, Mike Moreno Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le envían mensajes preguntándole si puede verificar que el área esté despejada de agentes de inmigración antes de salir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Antes de que inmigración llegara, si alguien veía un dron, nadie pensaba nada”, dice Moreno. “Si alguien veía un helicóptero volando sobre nosotros, pensaban, ‘Está bien, son las noticias revisando el tráfico o el Departamento de Policía de Chicago haciendo algo’. Ahora la gente está asustada”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreno, de 34 años, es un emprendedor de tercera generación. Creció en Archer Heights. Su abuelo emigró a Estados Unidos en la década de 1960, y su familia se mudó más tarde a La Villita, donde fueron de las primeras familias mexicanas en el vecindario. En 1977, su padre abrió Moreno’s Liquors, que se convirtió en una de las primeras licorerías de propiedad latina en Illinois. En 2019, Moreno expandió el negocio con Osito’s Tap, un bar atrás.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Con la presencia de agentes federales el otoño pasado, la gente se quedó en casa, dice Moreno. Las ventas disminuyeron en un 20% al principio, hasta un 60% en cierto momento, y se estabilizaron en una baja del 40% durante dos meses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Él dice que su negocio no se ha recuperado completamente, y tal vez no lo haga pronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Es la tormenta perfecta. Tienes una inflación que está en máximos históricos, tienes aranceles que están exacerbando eso. Los despidos están ocurriendo en todos lados”, cuenta Moreno. “Si juntas todo eso, lo último que necesitas es que la gente tenga miedo de salir a comprar”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nadie debería ser tratado así. Es irrespetuoso e inhumano”, asegura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreno dice que su familia le enseñó la importancia del compromiso cívico y la defensa. Su padre ayudó a establecer la Cámara de Comercio de La Villita y trabajó con líderes comunitarios para construir el icónico arco del vecindario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pesar del miedo en el otoño, dice Moreno, los residentes se unieron, y el momento podría unir a los latinos de diferentes comunidades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ver a la gente ayudándose mutuamente, llevando comida a una abuelita que tenía miedo de salir o advirtiendo a los vecinos sobre amenazas, eso fue inspirador”, agrega.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No vamos a rendirnos,” añade. “Todos juntos.

Utiliza un molino, una máquina que muele maíz, agua y otros ingredientes para hacer la masa utilizada en platillos mexicanos como los tamales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En lugar de celebrar 40 años en el negocio este año, Villarruel está preocupada por sus amigos, familiares, empleados y el vecindario en general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Después de que ICE y la Patrulla Fronteriza comenzaron a apuntar a South Chicago y a los vecindarios adyacentes del lado sureste el otoño pasado, Villarruel notó un cambio, especialmente alrededor de Acción de Gracias y Navidad, típicamente una época ocupada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Era lento. La gente tenía miedo de hacer fila”, cuenta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Su hijo, Saúl Villarruel, quien maneja las finanzas del negocio, dice que las ventas han disminuido drásticamente desde las fiestas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incluso ahora, “a gente está aterrorizada para salir”, agrega Cecy Villarruel. “No tengo miedo de salir, pero tengo miedo por mis empleados”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villarruel, ciudadana naturalizada estadounidense, dice que un trabajador no quiso salir durante tres o cuatro meses, y algunos de sus trabajadores todavía tienen miedo de salir y venir a trabajar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Llevábamos comida a sus casas. Muchos de ellos enviaban a sus nietos, y también tratábamos de llevar los productos a sus hogares”, cuenta Villarruel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saúl Villarruel dice que cuando los trabajadores no se presentan, otros miembros de la familia deben hacerse cargo del pequeño personal. “Sigue siendo un problema”, asegura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En una comunidad de inmigrantes africanos y latinos, él ve “a la gente mirando por encima del hombro”, dice. “Algunas personas tienen miedo de ser detenidas sólo por ser latinos”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aunque él es estadounidense de nacimiento y ciudadano, Saúl Villarruel se preocupa por su propia seguridad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Al mirarme, nadie asume que soy mexicano.

Dejamos de ir a la biblioteca, a las citas médicas. Ha cambiado nuestra vida un 100%”, dice María, quien pidió que no se revelara su apellido por temor a ser deportada. “Por la noche, no puedes dormir. Tienes miedo de que vengan a tocar la puerta. No sabes a qué hora del día van a venir. Pueden romper tus ventanas”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;María llegó hace cinco años de la ciudad fronteriza mexicana de Reynosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Era genial. Nos divertíamos mucho. La vida era buena”, dice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero eso ha cambiado. María dice que tiene miedo de salir por comida y llevar a sus hijos a la escuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mi hija de 13 años está bajo mucho estrés en este momento, y se le está cayendo el cabello”, dice. “Ha nevado, y no hemos podido salir a jugar en la nieve... Incluso han tenido que perder cosas como las prácticas de fútbol, los entrenamientos de boxeo y otras actividades cotidianas que estaban acostumbrados a hacer”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;María tiene que hablar de manera franca con sus hijos para que estén preparados para lo que podría suceder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Planeamos quedarnos aquí”, dice. “Si Dios nos permite quedarnos aquí, nos quedaremos, a menos que vengan por nosotros y tengamos que volver a México. Tendríamos que empezar de nuevo, porque nuestras vidas están aquí”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Volver arriba&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

darles un mejor futuro”, dice, pidiendo que no se la identificara porque teme represalias por hablar con los medios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La amenaza de que el presidente Donald Trump enviaría a la Guardia Nacional a las calles de Chicago ha disminuido desde el otoño, pero aún pesa sobre los miembros de la Guardia que en algunos casos tendrían que patrullar sus propios vecindarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No me sentiría bien con eso en absoluto”, dice la mujer del lado sureste. “Sé que si voy y tengo que detener a personas, lloraré porque no puedo controlarme.

Todo eso se hizo pedazos en octubre. Encontraron el lado este”, dice Pedraza, de 51 años, miembro de los equipos de respuesta rápida del lado suroeste y sureste, grupos comunitarios que se movilizan cuando residentes informan sobre avistamientos de ICE o agentes federales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creo que la comunidad en general quedó impactada al ver el nivel de violencia y el comportamiento agresivo”, cuenta. “Hubo adolescentes que fueron derribados en el suelo justo en la esquina más transitada del lado este, 106th y Ewing. Iban tras cualquiera y todos los que tuvieran piel oscura”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahora, dice Pedraza, la gente aquí vive sus vidas con más precaución. Los encuentros con ICE han disminuido, pero los miembros de la comunidad temen un regreso en marzo y los residentes son cautelosos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Las personas todavía van a redes sociales y dicen, ‘Vi algunos vehículos SUV oscuros. Vi un SUV con vidrios polarizados. ¿Puede alguien verificar?’”, cuenta Pedraza. “No creo que eso haya desaparecido. Creo que la gente definitivamente está manteniendo los ojos y oídos abiertos, porque sabemos que los agentes no han dejado el área”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La familia de Pedraza llegó a South Chicago en la década de 1960. Su padre enseñó en varias instituciones locales antes de abrir su propio pequeño negocio, y su madre trabajó largas horas en la fábrica de Jay’s Potato Chips. Al igual que muchas familias allí, dice Pedraza, “ayudaron a construir el vecindario ladrillo a ladrillo, turno a turno”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En noviembre de 2024, para ganar las elecciones presidenciales, Trump ganó terreno con los votantes latinos. Muchos, incluso en el lado sureste y el área de South Chicago, lo apoyan a él y a sus políticas, dijo Pedraza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eso está causando una división en la comunidad, dice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Definitivamente hay personas que sienten que ‘soy ciudadano estadounidense, no tengo nada que esconder. No es gran cosa solo mostrarles tu identificación’”, dice Pedraza. “Pero hay otras personas que sienten que es un gran problema. ¿Por qué no puedo caminar en mi vecindario sin sentir que tengo que demostrarle a alguien que soy ciudadano? Pensé que estábamos viviendo en Estados Unidos”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Volver arriba&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"ses-bautista\" name=\"ses-bautista\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lado sureste: Olga Bautista&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-af0000\" name=\"image-af0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/538ab63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5351x3003+0+282/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F15%2Fab4cbc194067880bdb731c41d8d0%2Fblitzeffect-260215-04-copy-01.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dc3e434/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5351x3003+0+282/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F15%2Fab4cbc194067880bdb731c41d8d0%2Fblitzeffect-260215-04-copy-01.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4133eb3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5351x3003+0+282/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F15%2Fab4cbc194067880bdb731c41d8d0%2Fblitzeffect-260215-04-copy-01.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Olga Bautista se encuentra en Colibri Coffee, ubicado en 3639 E. 106th St. en el lado sureste.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4133eb3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5351x3003+0+282/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F15%2Fab4cbc194067880bdb731c41d8d0%2Fblitzeffect-260215-04-copy-01.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/86f83d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5351x3003+0+282/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F15%2Fab4cbc194067880bdb731c41d8d0%2Fblitzeffect-260215-04-copy-01.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4133eb3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5351x3003+0+282/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F15%2Fab4cbc194067880bdb731c41d8d0%2Fblitzeffect-260215-04-copy-01.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olga Bautista se encuentra en Colibri Coffee, ubicado en 3639 E. 106th St. en el lado sureste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olga Bautista habla con orgullo sobre el lado sureste, su único hogar durante sus 47 años.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Esta comunidad está formada por familias de todo el mundo”, dice. “Familias de Europa del Este, familias mexicanas, personas de Latinoamérica. Campesinos afroamericanos del sur vinieron a trabajar en las fábricas de acero. Aquí hay una mezcla tan rica de culturas”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ubicada a lo largo del Lago Michigan, el área es conocida por los parques Calumet y Steelworkers, donde las familias se reúnen, los niños juegan al fútbol y generaciones han creado recuerdos. Bautista recuerda caminar al lago en minutos, asistir a campamentos de verano y más tarde ver a su propio hijo entrenar como salvavidas allí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Parroquia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, donde ella y sus hijos fueron bautizados, se encuentra entre las iglesias católicas mexicoestadounidenses más antiguas del Medio Oeste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero la sensación de seguridad y comunidad se ha visto sacudida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hemos visto una gran disminución de personas en las calles, comprando en los corredores comerciales”, cuenta Bautista, miembro de la Junta de Educación de Chicago. “La gente no está yendo a sus citas médicas. Los niños no están yendo a la escuela. Definitivamente está impactando la forma en que socializamos, la forma en que estamos en comunidad unos con otros. Los negocios aquí están sufriendo mucho”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La instalación de la Guardia Costera de Estados Unidos cerca del parque Calumet se había sentido accesible, con miembros de la Guardia Costera interactuando con las familias, organizando el truco o trato de Halloween y sentándose en mesas de picnic. La seguridad y la vigilancia aumentaron y se volvió más “militarizada”, dice Bautista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ella y otros residentes creen que el área ha sido utilizada como un terreno de preparación para operativos de aplicación de la ley de inmigración. Esos operativos han tenido un efecto paralizante en todo el vecindario, dice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Todavía estoy recibiendo avisos de que familias han sido secuestradas sólo esta semana. Están siendo secuestradas”, cuenta Bautista. “No están pidiendo información. Simplemente se llevan a estas personas. Las sacan de sus coches, de sus casas. Es muy violento. Es muy traumatizante para ellos y para sus familias y para toda esta comunidad, desde las historias de cómo las personas están siendo secuestradas hasta las imágenes visuales en la televisión”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Volver arriba&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"sw-progresando\" name=\"sw-progresando\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lado suroeste: Latinos Progresando &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c30000\" name=\"image-c30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9ec74d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4066250/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d737ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"El director ejecutivo de Latinos Progresando, Luis Gutiérrez, lidera una reunión de recursos comunitarios en la Secundaria María Saucedo en La Villita en febrero.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d737ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91950b6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d737ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;El director ejecutivo de Latinos Progresando, Luis Gutiérrez, lidera una reunión de recursos comunitarios en la Secundaria María Saucedo en La Villita en febrero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latinos Progresando, una organización que apoya a comunidades inmigrantes como Pilsen y La Villita, está lidiando con las consecuencias del Operativo Midway Blitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los miembros de la comunidad quieren respuestas, dice Luis Gutiérrez, quien fundó la organización hace 28 años.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muchos piden ayuda para navegar el sistema de inmigración y localizar a familiares que han sido detenidos. Los miembros del personal pasan horas tratando de determinar dónde se encuentran los detenidos. Los residentes llegan preocupados porque sus seres queridos no tienen su medicina o ningún medio para comunicarse con ellos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vienen todos los días buscando ayuda”, dice Gutiérrez, de 53 años, quien pasó la temporada de fiestas entregando comestibles, bienes esenciales para el hogar y regalos. Él y su personal visitaron a familias que tenían miedo de salir de sus hogares por temor a ser detenidos o deportados.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El trabajo ha afectado a los trabajadores de las organizaciones sin fines de lucro y de defensa, dice, “Constantemente estás respondiendo llamadas telefónicas, correos electrónicos y mensajes de texto, tratando de proporcionar algún tipo de información”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dice que los defensores dieron la voz de alarma a principios del año pasado, pidiendo apoyo, especialmente después de ver lo que sucedió en Los Angeles en el verano, pero pocos fuera de la comunidad latina respondieron inicialmente.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A finales del año pasado, de repente la ciudad despertó”, cuenta Gutiérrez. “Vimos a personas de diversas comunidades levantándose y diciendo, ‘Esto no está bien’”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El hijo de inmigrantes mexicanos, Gutiérrez, que creció en La Villita, dice que conoce de primera mano el miedo y la resiliencia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La posible detención por parte de funcionarios federales de inmigración ha causado ansiedad y trauma generalizados, creando una necesidad de servicios de salud mental, dice. “Nuestra comunidad realmente ha estado en modo de respuesta de emergencia desde que comenzó el COVID, y no hemos parado”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estoy trabajando con directores de escuela y estamos hablando sobre los niños que van caminando a la escuela solos”, dice Gutiérrez. “Estamos hablando sobre la falta de participación en programas e incluso en los consejos escolares locales”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Es triste”, agrega. “Pero cuando hablo con residentes de la comunidad y los veo navegar el sistema, hablar con sus hijos, preparar a sus familias, hay tanta fuerza y belleza en cómo se levantan durante este tiempo”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gutiérrez dice que los residentes creen que los agentes de inmigración regresarán, pero se sienten más preparados.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Otras comunidades se están levantando y protestando, y así vamos a continuar el trabajo, y lo que venga, lo vamos a manejar”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alejandra, una madre inmigrante de tres hijos, es una madre activa. Durante años, ha inscrito a sus hijos en actividades extracurriculares y ha sido voluntaria en un grupo de apoyo para padres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mi mayor esperanza es que todos mis hijos crezcan para ser buenas personas y miembros ejemplares de la sociedad”, dice. “Depende de nosotros como padres guiarlos por el camino correcto”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Como muchas inmigrantes de México, Alejandra cuenta que llegó a Estados Unidos hace 20 años en busca de una vida mejor y más oportunidades para sus futuros hijos. Ella y su esposo querían criar a sus hijos en Pilsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero ahora, después de vivir la oleada de la aplicación de la ley federal de inmigración en otoño, está replanteando su participación en la comunidad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dijo que ha permitido tentativamente que sus hijos — uno en la secundaria y dos en la primaria — reanuden actividades extracurriculares como fútbol y el club de teatro que habían dejado de hacer en otoño.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero dice que eso puede cambiar en los próximos meses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aún estamos un poco asustados. Me preocupa que las personas que están de acuerdo con esta administración se comporten mal o de manera agresiva hacia nuestra comunidad. No quiero que mis hijos vean nada de eso”, agrega.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alejandra dice que Pilsen suele ser un lugar tranquilo y unido, pero que el sentido de seguridad se ha ido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nuestras vidas han cambiado.

La Shawn Ford, whom the congressman endorsed while announcing his retirement &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/07/30/danny-davis-wont-seek-reelection-congress\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;last summer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ford, advocate for regulating hemp products&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, Ford has served in the Illinois General Assembly, where he chairs the House appropriations committee for higher education.

But that's what happened,” said Ford, who once called on former Gov. Pat Quinn to deploy the National Guard in Chicago to address gun violence in 2010 — long before President Donald Trump’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/01/28/trump-deployment-national-guard-chicago-cost-taxpayers-21-million-congressional-report\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;effort to federalize troops&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for city patrols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It put a spotlight on crime… You need people that's bold, that will say things, but listen to what their constituents say,” Ford said. “This is not something that I would call for anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s not the only candidate carrying name recognition and a little political baggage into the March 17 primary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-490000\" name=\"image-490000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bb2c39d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7383x4144+0+390/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F7d%2F5a67bbdb4101adc06f0c9d037564%2Fcongress7th-260212-16-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c0db830/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7383x4144+0+390/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F7d%2F5a67bbdb4101adc06f0c9d037564%2Fcongress7th-260212-16-1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e6b23b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7383x4144+0+390/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F7d%2F5a67bbdb4101adc06f0c9d037564%2Fcongress7th-260212-16-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"CONGRESS7TH_260212-16.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e6b23b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7383x4144+0+390/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F7d%2F5a67bbdb4101adc06f0c9d037564%2Fcongress7th-260212-16-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d6882e4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7383x4144+0+390/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F7d%2F5a67bbdb4101adc06f0c9d037564%2Fcongress7th-260212-16-1.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e6b23b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7383x4144+0+390/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F7d%2F5a67bbdb4101adc06f0c9d037564%2Fcongress7th-260212-16-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Rep.

She also cares for her disabled sister who relies on federal food assistance and other social services that have been scaled back under Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think about people that don't have help like my sister does,” said Conyears-Ervin, who's endorsed by the Chicago Teachers Union. “Those are the things that drive me, and I don't believe there's any other candidate in this race that has that testimony.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Conyears-Ervin agreed to pay a $30,000 fine to the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2023/9/6/23861199/treasurer-conyears-ervin-ethics-abuse-of-power-allegations\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Chicago Board of Ethics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Bernard Kurzon, the 30-unit apartment building at 1224 W. Loyola Ave. was once home to businesses Archie’s Cafe, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/reset-with-sasha-ann-simons/2024/01/25/experimental-art-space-faces-uncertain-future-after-building-bought-by-loyola-university\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Roman Susan Gallery&lt;/a&gt; and Edge Art. It's next to the Loyola Red Line stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university purchased the site in 2024 for $3 million, according to the student newspaper &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://loyolaphoenix.com/2024/01/loyola-buys-local-property-displacing-residents-and-local-businesses/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Loyola Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;. It was issued a demolition permit on Jan. 5, according to city records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Loyola wouldn’t confirm the building’s purchase price, and pointed to a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://t.e2ma.net/message/tt81kt/1zayu35d\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Feb. 11 newsletter&lt;/a&gt; that included a statement by Associate Vice President Jennifer Clark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark acknowledged the demolition permit “has raised questions” about the site's future. She wrote the location is part of a future Chicago Transit Authority project, “meaning Loyola will not be the sole decision-maker regarding its long-term use. But, we are committed to stewarding the site responsibly and thoughtfully.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demolition is expected to take four to six weeks, depending on site conditions and the weather, according to the university. Once complete, it plans to improve the site with “upgraded fencing and new landscaping.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller said there was a push to make the building a Chicago landmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be eligible, a Chicago building must meet at least two of the seven criteria established by the city, which includes having city heritage, unique visual features or being designed by a notable architect. The building must also meet a more abstract “integrity criterion,” which Miller said can be tough for individual commercial buildings or homes to meet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Loyola Avenue building has a scalloped roof with Spanish clay tile and ornamentation along the roof and commercial windows. But there weren't enough elements “to fit all the strict requirements,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a20000\" name=\"image-a20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/586d7a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+163/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F08%2F97%2Fdd63a4ce4dfca846c9bcb7b553f9%2Floyola-260224-16.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a49cd3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+163/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F08%2F97%2Fdd63a4ce4dfca846c9bcb7b553f9%2Floyola-260224-16.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/02c6abc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+163/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F08%2F97%2Fdd63a4ce4dfca846c9bcb7b553f9%2Floyola-260224-16.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A sign saying &amp;quot;Keep out.

It’s a building that we may see elsewhere in the city, but it was very special to people in Rogers Park.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller said Preservation Chicago regularly hears from residents accusing Loyola of “land banking” sites, or holding on to vacant land. It's a practice some residents believe will happen at 1224 W. Loyola, as the university has yet to announce development plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's really tragic that we're losing a nice building that’s got a lot of history,” Miller said. “Demolition is often times the answer with these university expansions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archie’s had circulated a petition in 2024 that called on Loyola to make its development plans more inclusive of neighbors and small businesses. Roman Susan, which started at the Loyola Avenue building, also issued a similar call in late 2024 for the university to recognize the importance of the building and its tenants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Roman Susan founder Kristin Abhalter Smith told the Commission on Chicago Landmarks that more than 1,500 people signed an open letter to Loyola. “I strongly believe that our combined communities of thousands of supporters wouldn’t exist without the location, shape and design of this distinctive piece of architecture,” Abhalter Smith said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller said he hopes universities like Loyola don’t demolish buildings until they have development plans and funding in place. He also urged alderpersons to consider creating landmark districts as a way to save buildings like 1224 W. Loyola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Landmark districts don't necessarily need to be buildings that are museum pieces captured in time and cannot evolve. Landmark districts are a way of encouraging the preservation of the look, feel and the spirit of the district, but it does allow for new construction,” Miller said. “These kinds of districts are really planning tools that encourage sensitive planning and development, and I think we need more of that in Chicago.”&lt;/p&gt;",

He had been traveling the district for months, “exploring” a run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson Jr., 60, said he has some unfinished business after leaving Congress in 2012 amid mental health issues, and ultimately, federal charges lodged against him for misusing his campaign funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My campaign is about connecting the second congressional district of Illinois to the global economy. That's the unfinished work of my 17 years of service in the Congress,” Jackson Jr., referring to his longtime push for a third Chicago airport in Peotone. “...That's the unfinished work of what's missing on the economy of the South Side of Chicago.

make it even more popular than it is today by including dental, vision and hearing and bringing more Americans into the system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And despite behind-the-scenes rumblings from other campaigns about Jackson Jr.’s mental health struggles, the former congressman said he has been open with his struggles — noting members of Congress have access to mental health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've struggled with depression all of my life,” Jackson Jr. said. “So did Martin Luther King Jr., so have other U.S presidents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson Jr. said he’s heard from young voters with mental health struggles — noting many are from a generation that has grappled with school shootings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am particularly grateful for at least the conscious observation that I've made with young people who are far more understanding of mental health than you know, say, even the older generation,” Jackson Jr. said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if a congressional win will move him one step away from his past, Jackson Jr. said he’s grappled with his mistakes, and he expects them “to present themselves in different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've come to accept who I am,” Jackson Jr. said. “I've come to accept the mistakes that I've made in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘I’m part of the community’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller is serving her second term as 6th District commissioner on the Cook County Board. She is pushing for Medicare for All, maternal health and reproductive justice and for good jobs and lower costs for working families, among other policy priorities. She served on the board of Planned Parenthood of Illinois and said she would push for Congress to codify Roe v. Wade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there has been a glaring spotlight on Miller’s fundraising. According to Federal Election Commission disclosures for October to December, Miller reported at least $875,000 from donors who have given to American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) or its affiliated super PAC, the United Democracy Project, since 2023. Peters’ campaign is also pointing to money they say is coming from Trump donors. And Jewish Insider and other outlets have reported that newly formed super PACs Elect Chicago Women and Affordable Chicago Now are running ads boosting Miller, State Sen. Laura Fine in her 9th Congressional District run and former Rep. Melissa Bean in her 8th District run. All three are viewed as moderate pro-Israel candidates. Those PACs won't have to disclose their donors until close to Election Day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-ac0000\" name=\"image-ac0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4e84cc0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5891x3306+0+310/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe8%2Fd1b58187421787f5a1a8a53a5107%2Fstrogerpresser-010126-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a3896e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5891x3306+0+310/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe8%2Fd1b58187421787f5a1a8a53a5107%2Fstrogerpresser-010126-10.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/707119f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5891x3306+0+310/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe8%2Fd1b58187421787f5a1a8a53a5107%2Fstrogerpresser-010126-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"ook County Commissioner Donna Miller attends a news conference at the Cook County Health Professional Building in the Illinois Medical District.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/707119f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5891x3306+0+310/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe8%2Fd1b58187421787f5a1a8a53a5107%2Fstrogerpresser-010126-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/82fcb7e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5891x3306+0+310/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe8%2Fd1b58187421787f5a1a8a53a5107%2Fstrogerpresser-010126-10.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/707119f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5891x3306+0+310/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe8%2Fd1b58187421787f5a1a8a53a5107%2Fstrogerpresser-010126-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook County Commissioner Donna Miller. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't have any MAGA donors.

About 44% of the 400 likely primary voters were undecided. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My record is strong with voters. People have seen me out in the community. I'm part of the community, and have been for decades now,” Miller said. “I didn't leave and never come back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘Broader, bigger version’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters, who was appointed to the state Senate in 2019 to succeed Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, says he’s been talking about Medicare for All since 2015 and abolishing ICE since 2019. And he’s been attacking large financial institutions for their impact on housing for almost a decade as an organizer, then as a state senator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s just the fact that I have a pretty strong track record of actually fighting for these policies,” Peters said. “Taking on the insurance industry and passing the Illinois Healthcare Protection Act with the governor. Taking on the fact that our hospital infrastructure, healthcare infrastructure has been chronically underfunded. When I was the chair of the Senate Black caucus, pushing to move hundreds of millions of dollars to safety net hospitals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div

schools “to rebuild the next generation of carpenters, plumbers and electricians.” He was also among a vocal minority to protest House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ push to further gerrymander Illinois districts last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, when it came down to us here in the second congressional district in the state of Illinois, gerrymandering here was not something that we should have engaged in,” Preston said. “And I was very vocal to the point that leader Jeffries came to the city of Chicago to meet with myself in particular, and some other leaders in the Black Caucus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preston said his pushback to stretching the district all the way to the Kentucky border makes him stand out in the crowded field to replace Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

They didn't say a word. And so they were willing to give away the people of the 2nd congressional district, because they wanted to be good boys and good girls and not have any type of confrontation with the party leader,” Preston said. “And to me, I think that that is a failure in leadership, and it's evidence that they don't have a fighting bone inside their bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighting words aside, Preston has had to speak out about reports of a past domestic violence charge — and previous comments he made online about former President Joe Biden. He called the criminal charge “the least proud moment” of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn't lie about it. I admitted it. I am a radically transparent person, and that is something we need in this party. That's what we need. We need somebody that's radically transparent,” Preston said. “Because people aren't stupid and the same old, same old tactics won't work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Packed field&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown served as village clerk of Matteson, and currently as a Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Commissioner. She said she’s running because she believes in environmental justice, clean water and safe streets, affordable healthcare, jobs that pay a living wage and strong public schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regis said he helped secure millions in federal funding for local governments, small businesses and nonprofits while working in Kelly’s office. As director of strategy at a Chicago-based environmental nonprofit, he leads clean energy and climate resilience initiatives in neighborhoods that need investment. He says that experience would equip him to advocate for affordable housing, public safety, environmental equity and economic opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France, a strategist, says the state must extend existing public transportation and expand airports to support the movement of cargo and passenger traffic. He also supports expanding affordable housing in the district and by pushing federal down payment assistance programs for first-time buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keating, a Flossmoor resident, is a trial and appellate lawyer. He calls himself a “common sense Democrat,” and says Democrats and a functioning Congress “must be defined by what we as the majority are for, not just who we are against.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore, who worked on several political campaigns, also ran for Illinois Secretary of State in 2022. He says he’s not a career politician and isn’t run by party politics or special interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe Congress needs more everyday people who understand what working families go through,” Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;",

He now brings resources to fellow troops after he was pulled back to help care for a sick relative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koledova is still checking in on loved ones facing down bullets and bombs.  Most days she waits for a short message from a friend on the front line: “450” means he’s “safe and OK.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But sometimes there’s no answer,” Koledova said. “Whenever we don't receive a message, there’s anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Koledova, a Vernon Hills resident who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine 19 years ago, the fight for her home country is her “daily life.” Her husband is a Ukrainian diplomat, and her father has been running meals and supplies to soldiers since the start of the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 1.8 million soldiers have been killed, wounded or are missing on both sides, according to a report last month by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank. But that number doesn’t include many of Koledova’s loved ones who have returned from the battlefield with mental health struggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been very hard for them to return to a normal life,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e60000\" name=\"image-e60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c74250d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F43%2F0a%2Ff15ca79a48d2b1fcc714a6acf3e7%2Fukraineanniversary-260224-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18cecad/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F43%2F0a%2Ff15ca79a48d2b1fcc714a6acf3e7%2Fukraineanniversary-260224-10.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b116b7b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F43%2F0a%2Ff15ca79a48d2b1fcc714a6acf3e7%2Fukraineanniversary-260224-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Oksana Koledova, owner of a Ukrainian grocery store called Varenychok located at 4840 N.

Human Rights Monitoring Mission. Russian peace proposals would require Ukraine to give up territory and abandon any hope of joining NATO, which she said was unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There are no people in the world who want this war to end more than we do,\" she said. \"We are in a Russia-orchestrated trap.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koledova returned from Kyiv on Monday and said life there has both changed and remained the same.

And they’re still pleading for the Cook County state’s attorney’s office to drop the case altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That relationship that she was in, she was at risk and her baby was at risk every single day,” Julie Koehler, of the Cook County public defender’s office, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every single minute that she was in that relationship, she was in danger and it was only a matter of time before something like this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-6c0000\" name=\"image-6c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f1df149/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F84%2F079a645e454aba11b5043d2bd73d%2Fdomestickilling-260224-03.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a4b47bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F84%2F079a645e454aba11b5043d2bd73d%2Fdomestickilling-260224-03.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18f5df9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F84%2F079a645e454aba11b5043d2bd73d%2Fdomestickilling-260224-03.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"DOMESTICKILLING_260224-03.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18f5df9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F84%2F079a645e454aba11b5043d2bd73d%2Fdomestickilling-260224-03.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5871c9a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F84%2F079a645e454aba11b5043d2bd73d%2Fdomestickilling-260224-03.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18f5df9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F84%2F079a645e454aba11b5043d2bd73d%2Fdomestickilling-260224-03.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Koehler, Keshia Golden’s public defender, stands at The Freedom Defense Center of Austin on Feb. 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A celebration turns violent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 22, 2022, Golden and her boyfriend, Calvin Sidney, were &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2022/10/30/23429205/calvin-sydney-dead-pregnant-woman-charged-murder-father-keshia-golden-domestic-violence\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;hosting a baby shower&lt;/a&gt; for their first child together. They were surrounded by family, friends, food and lots of gifts, Golden recalls. But after the party, something shifted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golden said the group went back to her West Side home, and Sidney started fighting with a friend. When she tried to intervene, Golden said Sidney pushed her down the stairs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she left briefly but returned when Sidney promised he’d calmed down. Then a mundane argument over the microwave escalated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From that, I really feel like I blanked out, because all I know is my face was on the counter for asking a question,” Golden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He slammed her into the counter, then the fridge, according to Assistant Public Defender Kyan Keenan. A relative tried to separate them, but Sidney wouldn’t relent, so Golden grabbed a knife and stabbed him in the leg, Keenan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e90000\" name=\"image-e90000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cf64d05/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1118x627+0+710/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F1a%2F262efaa103b55a24e624c0f1457f%2Fkeshia-golden.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c9d3617/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1118x627+0+710/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F1a%2F262efaa103b55a24e624c0f1457f%2Fkeshia-golden.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/609027d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1118x627+0+710/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F1a%2F262efaa103b55a24e624c0f1457f%2Fkeshia-golden.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Keshia Golden (left) at her baby shower Oct. 22.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/609027d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1118x627+0+710/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F1a%2F262efaa103b55a24e624c0f1457f%2Fkeshia-golden.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0f49ac6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1118x627+0+710/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F1a%2F262efaa103b55a24e624c0f1457f%2Fkeshia-golden.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/609027d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1118x627+0+710/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F1a%2F262efaa103b55a24e624c0f1457f%2Fkeshia-golden.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keshia Golden (left) at her baby shower on Oct. 22, 2022, hours before prosecutors say she killed Calvin Sidney, the father of her then-unborn child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was hit in his femoral artery and later died at Mount Sinai Hospital, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After the stab, I just ran out of the house,” Golden said. “I wasn't thinking clearly. I just wanted him to stop basically. I didn't know that it hit an artery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidney’s family couldn’t be reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t unusual for the couple to go from “a good time to a bad time,” according to Golden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had previously called police more than 50 times to report abuse, the public defender's said. Between June and September of 2022, police responded to five domestic violence incidents involving Golden and Sidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In four of them, Golden said Sidney had choked, punched, slapped or pushed her. In one case, Sidney accused her of stabbing him in the neck, prosecutors said. He was hospitalized, but didn’t press charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, Golden took out an order of protection against Sidney after he allegedly punched her in the face, according to court records and police reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pregnant behind bars&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golden said she went home about 30 minutes after the stabbing, not knowing Sidney had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was taken into custody and had to be hospitalized for a few days to address her own injuries. In the meantime, a Cook County judge &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2022/10/25/23423307/2m-bail-woman-accused-fatally-stabbing-boyfriend-argument-over-microwave-use\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;set her bond at $2 million&lt;/a&gt;. Golden wasn't present for the hearing and hadn’t spoken to her lawyers yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the judge originally set a $2 million bond in that courtroom, I lost my mind,” said Koehler, deputy chief of the public defender’s homicide task force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koehler called Mom’s United Against Violence and Incarceration and the Chicago Community Bond Fund to raise awareness and the money needed to get Golden out of jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a40000\" name=\"image-a40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3553b40/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+134/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fea%2Fdd%2Fc1cc4a21f75320503284bfe77857%2Fmerlin-3769941.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aaae63e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+134/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fea%2Fdd%2Fc1cc4a21f75320503284bfe77857%2Fmerlin-3769941.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/716edd2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+134/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fea%2Fdd%2Fc1cc4a21f75320503284bfe77857%2Fmerlin-3769941.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Cook County Jail near 26th Street and California Avenue. ****FILE ART OF COOK COUNTY JAIL**** 02-15-06 Cook County Jail, 26th and California, Chicago - A woman walks along the west side of Cook County Jail on S.

Separating out the accumulated interest, the total in illegally assessed fines and penalties adds up to roughly $163 million.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city's Law Department issued a statement saying City Hall is considering an appeal of Sullivan's ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, the city raised the fine for out-of-date city sticker violations from $100 to $200, with a $200 charge for late payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit also lists more than a dozen offenses — including having window tinting that is too dark or parking in a loading zone — that carry penalties of at least $140 and as high as $500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2022/5/6/23060313/chicago-parking-sticker-tickets-class-action-lawsuit\"   &gt;Appeals court ruling revives Chicago ticket lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kyle Garchar, one of two named plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit, racked up four city sticker violations within weeks in 2017 and 2018 while parking on the street in front of his house. Garchar said the $1,600 debt he racked up deprived him of his ability to earn money from his job as a ride-share driver, after the city notified Uber and Lyft about his unpaid tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The city has tried to extract as much as they can to make up for the poor financial decisions they’ve made,” Garchar, 35, told the Chicago Sun-Times. “Everyone has received a ticket they feel is not necessarily legitimate. But even if you fight it and go to administrative court, city employees are not like judges in a typical court. Unless there’s some sort of clerical error or typo or any inconsistency you can find, there’s no way to get out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garchar said drivers who tend to rack up the most tickets are “already broke” or struggling to pay bills, adding that the city has a “history of perpetuating that cycle of debt.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Blaha got five city sticker tickets in four weeks in 2013 — and five more in a month in 2015 — while working as a service worker searching for legal parking. He said while  the city’s impending refund will not amount to “life-changing money,”  he hopes it “sets a precedent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s another way of exposing the city, and how they are trying to take advantage of the people in it and basically stealing from the people,\" Blaha said. \"It’s great that they finally have to answer to that … abuse of power.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law department spokesperson Kristen Cabanban issued a statement saying although the city respects the \"judicial process, we are actively evaluating all available legal options, including an appeal. ... This matter is not final, and the city intends to continue vigorously defending the interests of its residents. We will have no further comment while the litigation is ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was originally filed in 2018, the final year of Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly four years later, the city changed the law to eliminate the cap-exceeding  penalties — a tacit admission that it had been breaching  the $250 state limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City attorney Mark Siegel admitted the violations  during a  2022 Finance Committee. meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overcharged drivers were represented by attorney Jacie Zolna, whose law firm, Myron M. Cherry &amp;amp; Associates, won a $38.75 million settlement against the city over late fees tacked on to red-light and speed camera tickets. Zolna said there’s a reason why state law established the $250 limit when it granted Chicago the power to create a “quasi-court” system that allows city employees to serve as judge and jury, making  it “nearly impossible to contest a violation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The trade-off that the General Assembly made was, 'OK, we will give the city the ability to adjudicate these tickets in this system that is tilted in its favor, but in exchange, you’re not going to be able to hammer people with the fines and penalties,'\" Zolna said. “For a decade, citizens upheld their side of that bargain while they got railroaded every time they got one of these tickets. But the city didn’t uphold their side of the bargain. They started charging people way more than they should have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zolna said he has offered to settle the case for “considerably less” than $163.5 million — only to be repeatedly rebuffed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now the city is out of bullets,” he said. “They could try to delay and appeal. But that would just go up to the appellate court that swatted them down three years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;",

That’s the year Giannoulias won his current elected post, replacing retiring incumbent Jesse White to oversee a government agency responsible for driver licenses and vehicle registrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Mandera and his family have collectively given nearly $30,000 more over the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes a $6,900 “in-kind” contribution to Giannoulias from Mandera in 2024 in the form of a Cubs suite for a fundraiser, according to Illinois State Board of Elections records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giannoulias and Mandera declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandera’s company and family have donated to another potential mayoral candidate, Ald. Bill Conway (34th), giving $20,000 to his campaign since 2022, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in the 1990s, Mandera ran the topless club under several names, from Thee Dollhouse to VIP’s, A Gentlemen’s Club to The Crazy Horse Too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pascente, a former Chicago cop known to associate with the late mobster Anthony Spilotro, was listed in a 1997 Chicago Crime Commission report on the Chicago mob as a known member or associate of organized crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"  data-align-floatRight&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d40000\" name=\"image-d40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72f254d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/642x360+0+296/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F01%2F539526e3446793ee696efeab2617%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-22-at-11-05-04-pm.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f40cd42/2147483647/strip/true/crop/642x360+0+296/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F01%2F539526e3446793ee696efeab2617%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-22-at-11-05-04-pm.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8387c5c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/642x360+0+296/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F01%2F539526e3446793ee696efeab2617%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-22-at-11-05-04-pm.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mob figure Fred Pascente&amp;#x27;s book in which he describes working with Perry Mandera at his Near North Side strip club.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8387c5c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/642x360+0+296/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F01%2F539526e3446793ee696efeab2617%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-22-at-11-05-04-pm.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8f2bad9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/642x360+0+296/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F01%2F539526e3446793ee696efeab2617%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-22-at-11-05-04-pm.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8387c5c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/642x360+0+296/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F01%2F539526e3446793ee696efeab2617%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-22-at-11-05-04-pm.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mob figure Fred Pascente’s book in which he describes working with Perry Mandera at his Near North Side strip club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevada gambling regulators banned Pascente from stepping foot in any casinos there, calling him “an associate of the Chicago organized crime family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pascente died in 2014 not long before his autobiography was released. Titled “Mob Cop: My Life of Crime in the Chicago Police Department,” the book includes passages about Mandera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pascente wrote: “We opened Thee Dollhouse in February of ’93. The owner was Perry Mandera. I was the main guy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I used to give Perry twenty-five thousand a week. I controlled the money. Every night I counted the money. So I know, &lt;i&gt;badda-bing&lt;/i&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandera also brought in Rick Rizzolo to help with the club at one point. Rizzolo had been running a Las Vegas strip club that employed reputed mob figure Rocco Lombardo, brother of the late mob boss Joey “The Clown” Lombardo.  Rizzolo had alleged ties to others in organized crime in Chicago and New York, according to published accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rizzolo’s Las Vegas club has been described in a court case involving a patron who was beaten and paralyzed there in 2001 as “infested by a rogues' gallery of thugs, thieves, drug pushers and corrupt ex-cops. Most, if not all, have well documented ties to organized crime figures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rizzolo couldn’t be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandera eventually sold his Chicago club, which had been involved in a long legal battle with City Hall over its liquor license and how much skin was allowed to be shown by female dancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another legal fight came in 2002 when a Mandera trucking firm called the Custom Companies was hit with a sexual harassment complaint from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which alleged that women working at the business were made to bring clients to Mandera’s strip club and subjected to a “sexually charged” workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-710000\" name=\"image-710000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4f41b54/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2012x1129+0+150/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F97%2Fdc%2Fce88e478467f912d949a940487b3%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-23-at-11-22-42-am.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a6b104/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2012x1129+0+150/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F97%2Fdc%2Fce88e478467f912d949a940487b3%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-23-at-11-22-42-am.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9ba0e6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2012x1129+0+150/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F97%2Fdc%2Fce88e478467f912d949a940487b3%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-23-at-11-22-42-am.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Among the recent campaign contributions to Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias from Perry Mandera and businesses affiliated with him.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9ba0e6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2012x1129+0+150/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F97%2Fdc%2Fce88e478467f912d949a940487b3%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-23-at-11-22-42-am.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/29dc857/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2012x1129+0+150/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F97%2Fdc%2Fce88e478467f912d949a940487b3%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-23-at-11-22-42-am.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9ba0e6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2012x1129+0+150/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F97%2Fdc%2Fce88e478467f912d949a940487b3%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-23-at-11-22-42-am.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the recent campaign contributions to Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias from Perry Mandera and businesses affiliated with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois State Board of Elections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandera’s Custom Companies has also contributed money to a trade group representing the trucking industry that in turn has given campaign money to Giannoulias, whose agency licenses and regulates truckers in Illinois.

Golden said that when her boyfriend threw her against a counter, she thought she and her unborn child were going to die. Then, after she fought back and fatally stabbed him, she thought she would spend the rest of her life behind bars, she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Her release&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Golden was eventually released from jail, thanks to a team of advocates and lawyers who rallied around her. She was able to give birth and raise her daughter on the outside. It has been \"the best thing that ever happened\" to her, Golden told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pending trial&lt;/b&gt;: Now she’s preparing for trial and is fearful that a jury won’t see her side of the story. Golden is due back in court next week.&amp;nbsp;Her lawyers plan to argue she was acting in self-defense against a man with a history of abuse. But they’re pleading for the Cook County state’s attorney’s office to drop the case altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjjitg-l-d/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;WAR IN UKRAINE 🇺🇦&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d00000\" name=\"image-d00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e15a9e5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fae%2F48%2Fe046a09a4b7889543bc3be8da186%2Fukraineanniversary-260224-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/47784b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fae%2F48%2Fe046a09a4b7889543bc3be8da186%2Fukraineanniversary-260224-2.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a346352/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fae%2F48%2Fe046a09a4b7889543bc3be8da186%2Fukraineanniversary-260224-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Oksana Koledova, owner of a Ukrainian grocery store called Varenychok located at 4840 N.

But that doesn’t include many who have returned from the battlefield with mental health struggles,&amp;nbsp;Koledova said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seeking refuge&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Iryna Potishma is among some of the 5.9 million refugees who have fled the country as Russia continues to occupy Ukrainian territory. More than 40,000 Ukrainians have found new homes in the Chicago area. Potishma's loved ones back home have mostly been spared from the battle, though months ago, missiles struck a building near her brother’s apartment.

&gt;Robert Herguth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donor history&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;For years, businessman Perry Mandera ran a topless bar on the Near North Side, at times with help from reputed organized crime associates, including the late \"mob cop\" Fred Pascente.&amp;nbsp;These days,&amp;nbsp;Mandera, his&amp;nbsp;family and their businesses are contributing heavily to the campaign fund benefitting Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The haul&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;With Giannoulias a potential candidate for Chicago mayor, companies affiliated with Mandera have contributed at least $80,000 to Citizens for Giannoulias since 2022. That’s the year Giannoulias won his current elected post. Beyond that, Mandera and his family have collectively given nearly $30,000 more over the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key context&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Pascente, a former Chicago cop known to associate with the late mobster Anthony Spilotro, was listed in a 1997 Chicago Crime Commission report as a known member or associate of organized crime.&amp;nbsp;Pascente died in 2014, not long before his autobiography was released. Titled \"Mob Cop: My Life of Crime in the Chicago Police Department,\" the book includes passages about Mandera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjjitg-l-p/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;MORE NEWS YOU NEED 🗞️&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-920000\" name=\"image-920000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cff8e91/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2F37%2Fd7d007c943eb8595274ec8fcb696%2Fimg-2967.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5470128/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2F37%2Fd7d007c943eb8595274ec8fcb696%2Fimg-2967.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/112a5f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2F37%2Fd7d007c943eb8595274ec8fcb696%2Fimg-2967.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Yoni Pizer&amp;#x27;s rental car and a truck on fire in a Puerto Vallarta street as violence spread across the area after the Mexican army killed New Generation Jalisco Cartel, Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, known as “El Mencho.&amp;quot;\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/112a5f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2F37%2Fd7d007c943eb8595274ec8fcb696%2Fimg-2967.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b8122b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2F37%2Fd7d007c943eb8595274ec8fcb696%2Fimg-2967.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/112a5f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2F37%2Fd7d007c943eb8595274ec8fcb696%2Fimg-2967.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jonathan Pizer’s rental car and a truck on fire in Puerto Vallarta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"line-height: inherit; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 24px; padding: 0px; list-style-type: disc;\" id=\"rte-742d4945-118a-11f1-9503-0dbc8aae0681\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjjitg-l-a/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Ex-state rep in Jalisco&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Jonathan \"Yoni\"&amp;nbsp;Pizer told the Sun-Times he was on vacation&amp;nbsp;Sunday in&amp;nbsp;Puerto Vallarta when he was forced out of his rental car at gunpoint.

Versluis, passengers get a life jacket and a set of ear plugs, because things can get \"loud and crunchy.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Versluis sets off from its mooring at Navy Pier one morning in early February, the sound of its 126-ton steel hull shuddering through ice grates on the ear like a trash compactor chomping rocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"For the first couple of years, when you’re smacking up against ice, it’s really nerve-racking. You just feel like that ice is going to pop right through the hull,\" said Eddie Popelas, who served as the tugboat’s engineer from 2002 to 2013 and whose father was at one time the boat’s captain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Capt. Billy Meilicke and Marine Engineer Rich Frizelis — in charge of the tugboat on this morning — the noise is just part of the daily soundtrack that includes the thrum of the 850-horsepower diesel engine and the single blast of the foghorn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjjitg-l-th/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;WATCH: ABOARD AN ICE BREAKER ▶️&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUtsLzLDmL-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;
