Simmons asks if she's on the phone with the police, but she doesn't respond and continues speaking to the person on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I'm not going to argue,\" Simmons says in the video. \"I'm gonna let you know that it is against the law to call the police on an elected official who's knocking doors, I know because I passed the law in 2021. So if you'd like me to leave the building, I would leave the building, but I am so disappointed in how you chose to handle the situation at a time when police have been known to get into deadly altercations with people of color.

They saw a truck parked in the intersection and a man with a gun running toward them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man pointed his gun through the car window and yelled at them in Spanish. Pizer and his group got out with the man pointing his gun in Pizer’s face The man then got into the driver’s seat and maneuvered the car to block the street and parked it. Seconds later, the vehicle went up in flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before we knew it, our rental car and the truck were in flames,” Pizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pizer, a former Illinois state representative who now works for U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley, watched as the man got onto a city bus and fired shots in the air, ordering people off the bus. The bus was soon set ablaze, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the commotion, Pizer sent frantic texts to friends back at his condo nearby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-350000\" name=\"image-350000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4047cc2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ea44e2d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/725c919/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Yoni Pizer, 2020 Illinois House 12th District Democratic primary election candidate.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/725c919/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/705b334/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/725c919/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2F18%2Fe2b40b1fb232f3e1c484370d3448%2F12th-il-house-jonathan-22yoni-22-pizer.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan “Yoni” Pizer was on his way to watch whales in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on Sunday when an armed cartel member seized his car at gunpoint and set it on fire.

He and a friend got separated from their husbands. A stranger told them to get in his car and drove them to the beach, which remained placid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People [were] doing yoga and jogging and riding bikes,” Pizer said. “No one knew what had just begun, and I did my best to tell people that there was a terrorist attack going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pizer and his friend walked along the beach back to their condo; their husbands took shelter in an orphanage at a nearby church. They stayed there for eight hours until the violence died down and they could return to the condo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Instability in Jalisco&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos circulating on social media showed smoke over the tourist city of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco and people sprinting through the airport of the state's capital in panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of American, Canadian, Mexican and international airlines canceled flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Guadalajara, which is scheduled to host matches during this summer's soccer World Cup, burning vehicles blocked roads and businesses closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-580000\" name=\"image-580000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/663ef61/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2F94%2Fbeecad184486aa77d72f09f240af%2F2262734563.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a745f8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2F94%2Fbeecad184486aa77d72f09f240af%2F2262734563.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/669a9fa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2F94%2Fbeecad184486aa77d72f09f240af%2F2262734563.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Burned cars are seen in the parking lot of a Costco retail store in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco state, Mexico, on February 23, 2026.

Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus told residents to stay at home, suspended public transportation and said the state was “living through critical hours.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumors circulated on social media that violence could continue and utilities could be shut off. But as Pizer and his party waited anxiously, calm prevailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ongoings of terror that we were worried about overnight, none of that came to pass,” Pizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pizer surmised that the goal of the violence was to communicate to the government that the cartel could take a certain level of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They really were about sending a message, we believe, to the government that they could turn on and turn off violence at a whim,” Pizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: “If they had wanted to kill people, we would have been among the first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pizer expressed concern about what the news will do for the area’s reputation, as much of Puerto Vallarta is dependent on tourism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We really want things to return to just the wonderful place that so many people know that it is,” Pizer said. “It really deserves our support and, frankly, going forward, our loyalty.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Disrupted wedding plans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In preparation for their wedding in Guadalajara on Friday, Kaitlin Bucaro and Robbie Morris were sitting at a Chicago coffee shop writing their wedding vows Sunday morning when they heard from a guest who had traveled to Mexico earlier that her flight was rerouted and couldn’t land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple read and watched news coming out of Guadalajara and within hours knew they’d have to cancel the 150-guest wedding they had spent a year — and thousands of dollars — planning. They were set to fly to Mexico on Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This situation that’s happening is not necessarily in these contracts with these vendors,” Bucaro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think very quickly we realized what was going on there was bigger than this wedding and bringing a bunch of people,” she said. “We needed to look out for everybody’s safety, including our own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple is “gutted,” Morris added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ve made friends in Guadalajara over several trips there the past few years.

After thousands of votes were cast, \"Abolish ICE\" was named as one of the winners in the city's \"You Name a Snowplow\" contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the Department of Streets and Sanitation announced the six winning names for the fourth annual snowplow-naming contest. They were pulled from more than 13,300 entries and 39,000 voters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top six snowplow names that received the most votes also included \"Stephen Coldbert,\" \"Pope Frío XIV,\" \"The Blizzard of Oz,\" \"Svencoolie\" and \"Caleb Chilliams.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Chance the Scraper\" received an honorable mention after it finished just .24% out of the top six, according to a city news release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I want to thank the people of Chicago for their unmatched creativity, sense of humor and civic pride,\" Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a news release. \"We are grateful and inspired by the record-breaking participation in the contest this year.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An overwhelming number of Chicagoans voted for \"Abolish ICE\" in the run-up to Monday's announcement. According to a list of all submissions &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/01/snowplow-name-contest-streets-sanitation-ice\"   &gt;provided to the Sun-Times&lt;/a&gt;, the slogan had been entered roughly 9,300 times by late January, making up about 70% of entries.

He failed to finish the first inning after racking up 25 pitches to six batters in the Sox’ 5-4 loss to the Rockies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he knows exactly where he stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘He understands that he’s a dude on this team,’’ manager &lt;b&gt;Will Venable&lt;/b&gt; said. ‘‘Last year, he came trying to prove he was a dude on this team. Going through that year, the expectations change for him now. But there’s the added obligation of being a leader on this club. Guys look at him and follow his lead. He’s somebody who is going to take that challenge on.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge Monday for Smith, who hit two batters, walked one and allowed three runs (two earned) and two hits, was throwing strikes. After pitching a complete second inning, he recalled being bad in his first start last spring before impressing during the rest of camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith would go on to make 29 starts for the Sox and finished 7-8 with a 3.81 ERA and 145 strikeouts in 146⅓ innings. Posting a 2.37 ERA in his first 13 starts helped him build a case to become the lone All-Star representative on what would be a 102-loss team. He also became the second Rule 5 player, along with second baseman &lt;b&gt;Dan Uggla&lt;/b&gt; in 2006, to make an All-Star team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring feels different to him, knowing he doesn’t have to impress every time out to win a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s nerves, it’s mechanics, it’s moving at game speed for the first time in a while,’’ he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘The pressure on yourself is different. Every day still matters, obviously. But it’s just what I want to work on today that’s going to set me up better for maybe five weeks from now, six weeks from now, rather than my next outing has to be perfect in order to do it.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Montgomery scratched&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortstop &lt;b&gt;Colson Montgomery&lt;/b&gt; was scratched because of illness, Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘He went out there and got his workout in,’’ Venable said. ‘‘Just not feeling well. He’s out with an illness. He wanted to play. We thought at this time in the year [it was] just better to let him get hydrated and recover.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will loves William&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;William Bergolla Jr&lt;/b&gt;., who made a flashy impression last spring before&lt;br&gt;batting .286/.342/.333 with no home runs and 40 stolen bases at Double-A Birmingham, had a start at shortstop fall into his lap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I don’t know if I’m supposed to say this, but he’s one of our favorites,’’ Venable said. ‘‘He’s a guy last year that we were really excited to have him come over. It seemed like he made every single play, got big hits, great defensively and just has an incredible feel for the game. Really excited he’s in camp with us now.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bergolla added weight and, perhaps, some power during the offseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘That is something that’s going to be huge for him because he really does everything else really well,’’ Venable said. ‘‘Just has to add a little more pop in there. But he’s a fun one to watch.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ROCKIES 5, SOX 4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zac Veen’s&lt;/b&gt; 468-foot walk-off home run against left-hander &lt;b&gt;Shane Murphy &lt;/b&gt;handed the Sox (3-1) their first loss of the spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Japanese slugger &lt;b&gt;Munetaka Murakami&lt;/b&gt;, whose strikeout rate in each of his last three seasons overseas approached 30%, struck out his first two times up before notching a single and an opposite-field double as he prepares for the World Baseball Classic.

Hitters are timing the not-so-rare-anymore velocity with rising competence. Therein lies the emphasis on equally valuable — or even more valuable — tools for pitchers: fastball command and keeping hitters off-balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor, 23, has known this for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Nowadays, the best starters and relievers throw 100-plus, but every single one of the best starters has five or six pitch mixes,’’ Taylor told the Sun-Times on Monday. ‘‘So it shows that the game is adjusting to the velo. The hitters are getting a little better, so you have to have more options to get guys out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘[Tigers ace Tarik] Skubal hit 103 last year, and he’s still got a great pitch mix. Velo in short stints can carry you through an outing. But for long-term success, you need some other pitches.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor featured a four-seam fastball, curve, slider, cutter and changeup last season. This spring, he’s introducing a two-seam fastball that runs away from left-handers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drafted in the second round out of LSU in 2023, Taylor posted a 1.01 ERA in 15 outings last season at Double-A Birmingham before breaking into the majors. He made 36 appearances with the Sox (34 of them in relief) and posted an unremarkable 4.91 ERA. But he struck out 54 batters and walked 15 in 36⅔ innings and finished well, allowing no runs in his last 10 outings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting might be in Taylor’s future — that’s his desire — but he will earn his big-league chops in the back of the Sox’ bullpen for now, likely with multi-inning assignments. He pitched a perfect inning Monday, striking out two Rockies and throwing 10 of his 12 pitches for strikes. Three pitches hit 100 mph and two others 99.6 and 99.9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor’s live batting-practice sessions have been must-see events early in camp. He didn’t disappoint last week, striking our four consecutive batters and breaking teammate Andrew Benintendi’s bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s gross,’’ Benintendi said of Taylor’s arsenal. ‘‘He has the 100-plus fastball, but he’s worked on some stuff in the offseason that will make him even more effective.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of the positive vibes simmering around shortstop Colson Montgomery’s rookie breakthrough last season, a promising young catching core and the signing of free-agent Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami, whether general manager Chris Getz’s rebuild can emerge from the muck of three consecutive 100-loss seasons largely hinges on quality pitching depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The master plan envisions Taylor being part of a contending staff, perhaps in the starting rotation with lefty prospects Noah Schultz and Hagen Smith, who are expected to make their big-league debuts this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We’ve had conversations about how that might play out in the future, but at this time I’m solely focused on doing the best I can in the pen,’’ Taylor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Any innings in the big leagues are fun. I enjoyed [the bullpen] last year, and I anticipate I’ll enjoy it again this year.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListL\" data-module  data-hide-authors=\"true\"

They come as WGN parent company Nexstar is working to merge with Tegna in a deal that’s under regulatory review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nexstar spokesperson said in a statement to the Sun-Times: “Nexstar does not comment on personnel issues, but the company is taking steps necessary to compete effectively in this period of unprecedented change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The layoffs are an apparent effort to cut costs in anticipation of the excessive debt Nexstar will incur from money borrowed to buy Tegna. WGN is still very profitable, despite changes in viewing habits, but the cuts have to come from somewhere, through no fault of the employees affected. Nexstar already has been carrying the debt from its $4.1 billion purchase of Tribune Media in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratings-wise, WGN News performs great in the morning, dominates Fox 32 at 9 p.m. and is competitive at 10. Its popular morning-news show is emulated by other stations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;",

Usually, we manage fine, but a current conflict may push me over the edge. \"Lauren\" lives alone with dogs that seem to be her only family. One of them (age 11) had been sick. She kept asking for sick leave to take him to the vet. I told her she had to use vacation time for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, the dog died, and now Lauren wants to take bereavement leave. When I refused, she had a fit and started yelling about unequal treatment because another co-worker, \"Jenny,\" was allowed to take bereavement leave earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenny's toddler son died in a drowning accident. It was a horrific tragedy. Jenny was traumatized and incapacitated for weeks. The situations are not comparable. But Jenny heard Lauren yelling and comparing Jenny's child to her elderly basset hound. This is causing all sorts of interpersonal problems that HR has flatly refused to get involved with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I understand that Lauren loved her dog, but I also think she needs to get a grip, apologize to Jenny and take a vacation if she needs to. Is it unreasonable to expect an adult to know the difference between a human and a dog and act accordingly? — &lt;i&gt;STRESSED SUPERVISOR IN CALIFORNIA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR SUPERVISOR:&lt;/b&gt; I think you already know the answer to your rather snarky question. HR at your firm may be reluctant to handle this hot potato because they do not have a policy in place that covers pet illness or bereavement for the loss of one. Please suggest it to your employer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My wife and I are seniors and live in a one-floor condominium. I am in good health, but she has several medical issues, including impaired balance and mobility. She refuses the recommended physical therapy and rarely uses the walker I bought for her. She hates cooking now and wants me to drive almost daily for takeout, which is expensive and time-consuming. Now, she's talking about selling our condominium to move into a seniors' complex with independent, assisted and continuing care phases. All meals are prepared there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do not want this move and have told her so. When I do, she goes silent for days, telling me it's time for the change. I disagree. We are at an impasse. I am so upset about this I am considering divorce after 55 years. What do you recommend we do? — &lt;i&gt;STILL YOUNG IN NORTH CAROLINA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR STILL YOUNG:&lt;/b&gt; I recommend you discuss this with your CPA and your attorney before making any decisions. If you could afford it, an assisted living facility for her while you remain in the condo might be ideal. However, if that's not possible, would you be willing to send her to the facility while you rent a one-bedroom apartment for yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I am pretty sure of: Your wife is signaling that she's shutting down. Her world is now smaller than it was. You haven't aged at the same rate, and it may be time to do for her what you would like her to do for you if the situation were reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Lo que es normal hoy en las comunidades mayoritariamente latinas de la ciudad no es lo que era antes del Operativo Midway Blitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El lado sureste, definido durante mucho tiempo por fábricas de acero y comunidades de clase trabajadora, fue uno de los primeros lugares a los que llegaron los mexicanos cuando llegaron a Chicago hace más de un siglo. En el lado oeste, conocido como el Lower West Side, Pilsen destaca por sus coloridos murales, su rica escena artística y culinaria, y su vibrante cultura chicana. Un poco más al suroeste, La Villita, cuenta con un vibrante corredor comercial y celebraciones comunitarias, como el desfile del Día de la Independencia Mexicana, que están entre los más antiguos y grandes del Medio Oeste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estos vecindarios trazaron caminos separados para convertirse en centros culturales mayoritariamente latinos para las comunidades mexicanas en Chicago. Pero compartieron una experiencia común el otoño pasado: el Operativo Midway Blitz de la administración de Trump. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/live/2025/09/16/cbp-raids-ice-chicago-elgin-operation-at-large\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;La campaña de aplicación de la ley de inmigración comenzó el 16 de septiembre,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Día de la Independencia Mexicana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los funcionarios federales dijeron que el operativo se enfocó en criminales violentos sin estatus legal, aunque &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/03/28/tren-de-aragua-venezuela-gang-trump-tom-homan-terrorism-violence-crime-chicago-colombia-honduras-ecuador-nicolas-maduro-salvador\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;esto resultó ser en gran medida falso&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A medida que aumentó la aplicación de la ley de inmigración, el miedo se extendió por Chicago y sus suburbios. Los vecindarios de mayoría latina e inmigrante, incluyendo Pilsen, La Villita y el lado sureste, entraron en alerta máxima.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estas comunidades desarrollaron su identidad latina a lo largo de generaciones, formadas por la migración, el trabajo y el desplazamiento. Los operativos de inmigración dirigidos por Trump crearon un momento compartido en sus historias, un momento lleno de miedo, incertidumbre y orgullo comunitario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        &lt;bsp-carousel class=\"Carousel Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"gallery-overview\" name=\"gallery-overview\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slides\"&gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slide\"&gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-media\"&gt;\n        \n            \n                \n                    &lt;picture data-crop=\"large\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/016e7ca/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1982+0+7/resize/840x555!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F8d%2Fecc640ab430bba904f833a745188%2Flvprotest-102625-13.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a79284/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1982+0+7/resize/1680x1110!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F8d%2Fecc640ab430bba904f833a745188%2Flvprotest-102625-13.jpg 2x\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/097d8a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1982+0+7/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F8d%2Fecc640ab430bba904f833a745188%2Flvprotest-102625-13.jpg\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"LVPROTEST-102625-13.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/097d8a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1982+0+7/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F8d%2Fecc640ab430bba904f833a745188%2Flvprotest-102625-13.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/38c676a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1982+0+7/resize/1680x1110!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F8d%2Fecc640ab430bba904f833a745188%2Flvprotest-102625-13.jpg 2x\" width=\"840\" height=\"555\"\n        src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/097d8a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1982+0+7/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F8d%2Fecc640ab430bba904f833a745188%2Flvprotest-102625-13.jpg\"&gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n                \n            \n        \n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-info\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-infoTitle\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-infoDescription\"&gt;Protesters march westbound on 26th Street in Little Village over recent federal law enforcement raids in the Chicago area, as part of Operation Midway Blitz, Saturday, Oct. 25, 2025.&lt;/span&gt;\n            \n            \n                &lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-pipe\"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;\n                &lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-infoAttribution\"&gt;Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-pagination\"&gt;\n            &lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-currentSlide\"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

a principios de 1900. Muchos llegaron en 1919, cuando fueron reclutados durante una huelga nacional de fábricas de acero. Estas comunidades se convirtieron en parte de la columna vertebral del área industrial de South Chicago y el lado este, creando una identidad que perdura hasta hoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En 1923, la comunidad estableció la Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, la primera parroquia mexicoestadounidense en la ciudad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A partir de 2023, los latinos en el lado este y South Chicago representaban la mitad de los 52,000 residentes de los vecindarios, según la Agencia Metropolitana de Planeación de Chicago. El lado este solo es casi 90% latino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Historias de South Chicago y el lado sureste&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sc-masa\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Molino de Masa de Cecy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sc-maria\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;María&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#ses-natg\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Miembro de la Guardia Nacional de Illinois&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sc-pedraza\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Corina Pedraza&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#ses-bautista\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Olga Bautista&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"pilsen-top\" name=\"pilsen-top\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c107295/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/efbfe2a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53a3f35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"María Ruiz y Rita se sientan sobre un auto en el Desfile del Día de la Independencia de México mientras avanza en 91st Street en el lado sureste el 15 de septiembre de 1957.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53a3f35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2efd0e4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53a3f35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;María Ruiz y Rita se sientan sobre un auto en el Desfile del Día de la Independencia de México mientras avanza en 91st Street en el lado sureste el 15 de septiembre de 1957.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southeast Chicago Historical Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pilsen&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antes de que Pilsen se conociera por su identidad mexicana y mexicoamericana —con sus calles llenas de murales coloridos, tiendas y restaurantes mexicanos— el vecindario fue hogar de olas de inmigrantes europeos. Nombrada en honor a Plzeň, en lo que hoy es la República Checa, Pilsen comenzó a cambiar a mediados del siglo XX cuando las familias mexicanas y puertorriqueñas se mudaron, muchas desplazadas del lado oeste cercano debido a la construcción de autopistas y la expansión del campus de la Universidad de Illinois en Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Para la década de 1960, Pilsen se había convertido en predominantemente latino, modelada por el activismo social, el compromiso cívico y la expresión artística. Hoy, Pilsen es 68% latino e hispano, según datos del Censo de Estados Unidos. En los últimos años, el aumento en los costos de vivienda y el nuevo desarrollo han suscitado preocupaciones sobre la gentrificación y el desplazamiento de los residentes de muchos años.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Historias de Pilsen y el lado suroeste&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#pils-alejandra\"   &gt;Alejandra&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sw-progresando\"   &gt;Latinos Progresando&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"lv-top\" name=\"lv-top\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a5c4ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/777bfd5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49a8def/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mexican students protest at Froebel school in 1973.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49a8def/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4529303/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49a8def/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexican students protest at the Froebel Branch of Harrison High School at 2021 W. 21st St. in Chicago, May 5, 1973.

En 1990, el gobierno mexicano donó el arco de La Villita, consolidando la identidad del vecindario. Dice “Bienvenidos a Little Village”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El vecindario estaba orgulloso de sus raíces. Muchos comenzaron a llamar a La Villita “el México del Medio Oeste”. Los últimos datos del Censo de Estados Unidos muestran que South Lawndale, aún el nombre oficial del área, es 81% latino e hispano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El corredor entre Pilsen y La Villita tiene ahora la mayor concentración de latinos en el Medio Oeste. El corredor comercial de la calle 26 de La Villita genera millones en ingresos anuales y es el segundo distrito generador de impuestos más alto de la ciudad, después de la Milla Magnífica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Historias de La Villita&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#lv-viento\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Viento, el club de corredores&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#lv-morenos\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Licorería Moreno’s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"  data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-6e0000\" name=\"image-6e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b0e00db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/51731da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e14a6c4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"En 1983, Rudy Lozano, un activista comunitario mexicoestadounidense que fue fundamental en la campaña para la elección de Harold Washington como alcalde, fue asesinado en su hogar tras la victoria de Washington.

Hacia el final del operativo, el 10 de noviembre, docenas de agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza posaron en el centro de la ciudad frente a “El Frijol”. Mientras se preparaban para tomar la foto, un agente supuestamente dijo: “¡Todos digan ‘La Villita’!”. Según informes de los medios, los agentes gritaron de vuelta: “¡La Villita!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entre tanto, los agentes federales &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2025/11/06/tengo-papeles-maestra-es-detenida-por-agentes-de-inmigracion-en-guarderia-de-chicago\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;interrumpieron la vida diaria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, particularmente en lugares como La Villita, Pilsen y el lado sureste. Inmigrantes y otros habitantes de Chicago temían ser detenidos mientras caminaban por la calle, esperaban el autobús o llevaban a sus hijos a la escuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En algunos vecindarios, las calles estaban vacías. Los propietarios de negocios vieron drásticas caídas en las ventas. Algunos temían tener que cerrar. Los eventos comunitarios y algunos desfiles fueron cancelados.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los vecindarios conocidos por su vitalidad y vida comunitaria unida estaban en silencio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Las familias temían la separación, y los padres se preocupaban por el impacto a largo plazo en sus hijos. Críticos de los operativos de inmigración señalaron tácticas violentas, operativos performativos y detenciones inconstitucionales. Los partidarios dijeron que el gobierno federal estaba apuntando a inmigrantes violentos y peligrosos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Según documentos del Departamento de Justicia, 97% de los detenidos durante el Operativo Midway Blitz no tenían antecedentes criminales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La administración de Trump continuó impulsando la narrativa de que estaba sacando a asesinos y violadores de las calles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Después de que los agentes posaron en “El Frijol”, comenzaron a salir de Chicago. El aflujo federal de unos 300 agentes para el Operativo Midway Blitz terminó. Pero la aplicación de la ley de inmigración de ICE —Inmigración y Control de Aduanas— continúa.

Villita, sólo se comunicaban entre ellos para cancelar una carrera. Ahora se envían mensajes para verificar si ha habido avistamientos de agentes federales y luego decidir cuándo correrán y por qué ruta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Normalmente estoy verificando, ‘¿Cómo están todos personalmente?’ pero también, ‘¿Qué piensan sobre correr hoy? ¿Qué es algo en lo que deberíamos estar atentos?’”, dice Jess Vergara, de 37 años, quien fue parte del grupo que creó el club hace 13 años. “Así que estamos preparados cuando surgen las cosas”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El club tiene una nueva regla: nadie puede correr solo. Vergara dice que los corredores disminuirán la velocidad o regresarán para asegurarse de que nadie esté demasiado lejos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El club es mayormente latino y corre tres veces a la semana, reuniéndose en 26th Street y South Central Park Avenue, como lo han hecho durante 13 años.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los residentes los reconocen. Los dueños de negocios los saludan a su paso y los miembros suelen reunirse después de las carreras en restaurantes para tomar café.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los agentes federales de inmigración llegaron en septiembre, aproximadamente un mes antes del Maratón de Chicago. Para muchos corredores, no correr no era una opción después de semanas de entrenamiento.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vergara y los otros capitanes querían mantener a los corredores seguros. Trazaron rutas y paradas de agua; identificaron refugios seguros en caso de que los agentes los abordaran. Los miembros proporcionaron contactos de emergencia en caso de que algún corredor fuera detenido. El club llevó a cabo capacitaciones sobre Conoce tus Derechos para los corredores y sus familias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahora, dice Vergara, están tratando de mantener motivados a los corredores, pero también se están preparando en caso de que los federales regresen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estamos constantemente revisando las noticias, qué están haciendo otras organizaciones en La Villita y alrededor de Chicago”, dice. “Mantenemos contacto con los equipos de respuesta rápida y vemos qué están diciendo”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Es un sentimiento tan diferente.

inmigración. Los clientes han comenzado a regresar, “pero la gente tiene esta inquietud”, dice el dueño de la tienda, Mike Moreno Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le envían mensajes preguntándole si puede verificar que el área esté despejada de agentes de inmigración antes de salir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Antes de que inmigración llegara, si alguien veía un dron, nadie pensaba nada”, dice Moreno. “Si alguien veía un helicóptero volando sobre nosotros, pensaban, ‘Está bien, son las noticias revisando el tráfico o el Departamento de Policía de Chicago haciendo algo’. Ahora la gente está asustada”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreno, de 34 años, es un emprendedor de tercera generación. Creció en Archer Heights. Su abuelo emigró a Estados Unidos en la década de 1960, y su familia se mudó más tarde a La Villita, donde fueron de las primeras familias mexicanas en el vecindario. En 1977, su padre abrió Moreno’s Liquors, que se convirtió en una de las primeras licorerías de propiedad latina en Illinois. En 2019, Moreno expandió el negocio con Osito’s Tap, un bar atrás.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Con la presencia de agentes federales el otoño pasado, la gente se quedó en casa, dice Moreno. Las ventas disminuyeron en un 20% al principio, hasta un 60% en cierto momento, y se estabilizaron en una baja del 40% durante dos meses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Él dice que su negocio no se ha recuperado completamente, y tal vez no lo haga pronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Es la tormenta perfecta. Tienes una inflación que está en máximos históricos, tienes aranceles que están exacerbando eso. Los despidos están ocurriendo en todos lados”, cuenta Moreno. “Si juntas todo eso, lo último que necesitas es que la gente tenga miedo de salir a comprar”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nadie debería ser tratado así. Es irrespetuoso e inhumano”, asegura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreno dice que su familia le enseñó la importancia del compromiso cívico y la defensa. Su padre ayudó a establecer la Cámara de Comercio de La Villita y trabajó con líderes comunitarios para construir el icónico arco del vecindario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pesar del miedo en el otoño, dice Moreno, los residentes se unieron, y el momento podría unir a los latinos de diferentes comunidades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ver a la gente ayudándose mutuamente, llevando comida a una abuelita que tenía miedo de salir o advirtiendo a los vecinos sobre amenazas, eso fue inspirador”, agrega.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No vamos a rendirnos,” añade. “Todos juntos.

Utiliza un molino, una máquina que muele maíz, agua y otros ingredientes para hacer la masa utilizada en platillos mexicanos como los tamales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En lugar de celebrar 40 años en el negocio este año, Villarruel está preocupada por sus amigos, familiares, empleados y el vecindario en general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Después de que ICE y la Patrulla Fronteriza comenzaron a apuntar a South Chicago y a los vecindarios adyacentes del lado sureste el otoño pasado, Villarruel notó un cambio, especialmente alrededor de Acción de Gracias y Navidad, típicamente una época ocupada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Era lento. La gente tenía miedo de hacer fila”, cuenta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Su hijo, Saúl Villarruel, quien maneja las finanzas del negocio, dice que las ventas han disminuido drásticamente desde las fiestas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incluso ahora, “a gente está aterrorizada para salir”, agrega Cecy Villarruel. “No tengo miedo de salir, pero tengo miedo por mis empleados”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villarruel, ciudadana naturalizada estadounidense, dice que un trabajador no quiso salir durante tres o cuatro meses, y algunos de sus trabajadores todavía tienen miedo de salir y venir a trabajar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Llevábamos comida a sus casas. Muchos de ellos enviaban a sus nietos, y también tratábamos de llevar los productos a sus hogares”, cuenta Villarruel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saúl Villarruel dice que cuando los trabajadores no se presentan, otros miembros de la familia deben hacerse cargo del pequeño personal. “Sigue siendo un problema”, asegura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En una comunidad de inmigrantes africanos y latinos, él ve “a la gente mirando por encima del hombro”, dice. “Algunas personas tienen miedo de ser detenidas sólo por ser latinos”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aunque él es estadounidense de nacimiento y ciudadano, Saúl Villarruel se preocupa por su propia seguridad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Al mirarme, nadie asume que soy mexicano.

Dejamos de ir a la biblioteca, a las citas médicas. Ha cambiado nuestra vida un 100%”, dice María, quien pidió que no se revelara su apellido por temor a ser deportada. “Por la noche, no puedes dormir. Tienes miedo de que vengan a tocar la puerta. No sabes a qué hora del día van a venir. Pueden romper tus ventanas”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;María llegó hace cinco años de la ciudad fronteriza mexicana de Reynosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Era genial. Nos divertíamos mucho. La vida era buena”, dice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero eso ha cambiado. María dice que tiene miedo de salir por comida y llevar a sus hijos a la escuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mi hija de 13 años está bajo mucho estrés en este momento, y se le está cayendo el cabello”, dice. “Ha nevado, y no hemos podido salir a jugar en la nieve... Incluso han tenido que perder cosas como las prácticas de fútbol, los entrenamientos de boxeo y otras actividades cotidianas que estaban acostumbrados a hacer”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;María tiene que hablar de manera franca con sus hijos para que estén preparados para lo que podría suceder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Planeamos quedarnos aquí”, dice. “Si Dios nos permite quedarnos aquí, nos quedaremos, a menos que vengan por nosotros y tengamos que volver a México. Tendríamos que empezar de nuevo, porque nuestras vidas están aquí”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Volver arriba&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

darles un mejor futuro”, dice, pidiendo que no se la identificara porque teme represalias por hablar con los medios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La amenaza de que el presidente Donald Trump enviaría a la Guardia Nacional a las calles de Chicago ha disminuido desde el otoño, pero aún pesa sobre los miembros de la Guardia que en algunos casos tendrían que patrullar sus propios vecindarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No me sentiría bien con eso en absoluto”, dice la mujer del lado sureste. “Sé que si voy y tengo que detener a personas, lloraré porque no puedo controlarme.

Todo eso se hizo pedazos en octubre. Encontraron el lado este”, dice Pedraza, de 51 años, miembro de los equipos de respuesta rápida del lado suroeste y sureste, grupos comunitarios que se movilizan cuando residentes informan sobre avistamientos de ICE o agentes federales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creo que la comunidad en general quedó impactada al ver el nivel de violencia y el comportamiento agresivo”, cuenta. “Hubo adolescentes que fueron derribados en el suelo justo en la esquina más transitada del lado este, 106th y Ewing. Iban tras cualquiera y todos los que tuvieran piel oscura”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahora, dice Pedraza, la gente aquí vive sus vidas con más precaución. Los encuentros con ICE han disminuido, pero los miembros de la comunidad temen un regreso en marzo y los residentes son cautelosos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Las personas todavía van a redes sociales y dicen, ‘Vi algunos vehículos SUV oscuros. Vi un SUV con vidrios polarizados. ¿Puede alguien verificar?’”, cuenta Pedraza. “No creo que eso haya desaparecido. Creo que la gente definitivamente está manteniendo los ojos y oídos abiertos, porque sabemos que los agentes no han dejado el área”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La familia de Pedraza llegó a South Chicago en la década de 1960. Su padre enseñó en varias instituciones locales antes de abrir su propio pequeño negocio, y su madre trabajó largas horas en la fábrica de Jay’s Potato Chips. Al igual que muchas familias allí, dice Pedraza, “ayudaron a construir el vecindario ladrillo a ladrillo, turno a turno”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En noviembre de 2024, para ganar las elecciones presidenciales, Trump ganó terreno con los votantes latinos. Muchos, incluso en el lado sureste y el área de South Chicago, lo apoyan a él y a sus políticas, dijo Pedraza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eso está causando una división en la comunidad, dice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Definitivamente hay personas que sienten que ‘soy ciudadano estadounidense, no tengo nada que esconder. No es gran cosa solo mostrarles tu identificación’”, dice Pedraza. “Pero hay otras personas que sienten que es un gran problema. ¿Por qué no puedo caminar en mi vecindario sin sentir que tengo que demostrarle a alguien que soy ciudadano? Pensé que estábamos viviendo en Estados Unidos”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Volver arriba&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"ses-bautista\" name=\"ses-bautista\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lado sureste: Olga Bautista&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-af0000\" name=\"image-af0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/538ab63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5351x3003+0+282/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F15%2Fab4cbc194067880bdb731c41d8d0%2Fblitzeffect-260215-04-copy-01.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dc3e434/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5351x3003+0+282/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F15%2Fab4cbc194067880bdb731c41d8d0%2Fblitzeffect-260215-04-copy-01.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4133eb3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5351x3003+0+282/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F15%2Fab4cbc194067880bdb731c41d8d0%2Fblitzeffect-260215-04-copy-01.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Olga Bautista se encuentra en Colibri Coffee, ubicado en 3639 E. 106th St. en el lado sureste.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4133eb3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5351x3003+0+282/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F15%2Fab4cbc194067880bdb731c41d8d0%2Fblitzeffect-260215-04-copy-01.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/86f83d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5351x3003+0+282/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F15%2Fab4cbc194067880bdb731c41d8d0%2Fblitzeffect-260215-04-copy-01.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4133eb3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5351x3003+0+282/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F15%2Fab4cbc194067880bdb731c41d8d0%2Fblitzeffect-260215-04-copy-01.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olga Bautista se encuentra en Colibri Coffee, ubicado en 3639 E. 106th St. en el lado sureste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olga Bautista habla con orgullo sobre el lado sureste, su único hogar durante sus 47 años.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Esta comunidad está formada por familias de todo el mundo”, dice. “Familias de Europa del Este, familias mexicanas, personas de Latinoamérica. Campesinos afroamericanos del sur vinieron a trabajar en las fábricas de acero. Aquí hay una mezcla tan rica de culturas”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ubicada a lo largo del Lago Michigan, el área es conocida por los parques Calumet y Steelworkers, donde las familias se reúnen, los niños juegan al fútbol y generaciones han creado recuerdos. Bautista recuerda caminar al lago en minutos, asistir a campamentos de verano y más tarde ver a su propio hijo entrenar como salvavidas allí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Parroquia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, donde ella y sus hijos fueron bautizados, se encuentra entre las iglesias católicas mexicoestadounidenses más antiguas del Medio Oeste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero la sensación de seguridad y comunidad se ha visto sacudida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hemos visto una gran disminución de personas en las calles, comprando en los corredores comerciales”, cuenta Bautista, miembro de la Junta de Educación de Chicago. “La gente no está yendo a sus citas médicas. Los niños no están yendo a la escuela. Definitivamente está impactando la forma en que socializamos, la forma en que estamos en comunidad unos con otros. Los negocios aquí están sufriendo mucho”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La instalación de la Guardia Costera de Estados Unidos cerca del parque Calumet se había sentido accesible, con miembros de la Guardia Costera interactuando con las familias, organizando el truco o trato de Halloween y sentándose en mesas de picnic. La seguridad y la vigilancia aumentaron y se volvió más “militarizada”, dice Bautista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ella y otros residentes creen que el área ha sido utilizada como un terreno de preparación para operativos de aplicación de la ley de inmigración. Esos operativos han tenido un efecto paralizante en todo el vecindario, dice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Todavía estoy recibiendo avisos de que familias han sido secuestradas sólo esta semana. Están siendo secuestradas”, cuenta Bautista. “No están pidiendo información. Simplemente se llevan a estas personas. Las sacan de sus coches, de sus casas. Es muy violento. Es muy traumatizante para ellos y para sus familias y para toda esta comunidad, desde las historias de cómo las personas están siendo secuestradas hasta las imágenes visuales en la televisión”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Volver arriba&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"sw-progresando\" name=\"sw-progresando\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lado suroeste: Latinos Progresando &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c30000\" name=\"image-c30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9ec74d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4066250/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d737ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"El director ejecutivo de Latinos Progresando, Luis Gutiérrez, lidera una reunión de recursos comunitarios en la Secundaria María Saucedo en La Villita en febrero.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d737ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91950b6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d737ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;El director ejecutivo de Latinos Progresando, Luis Gutiérrez, lidera una reunión de recursos comunitarios en la Secundaria María Saucedo en La Villita en febrero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latinos Progresando, una organización que apoya a comunidades inmigrantes como Pilsen y La Villita, está lidiando con las consecuencias del Operativo Midway Blitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los miembros de la comunidad quieren respuestas, dice Luis Gutiérrez, quien fundó la organización hace 28 años.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muchos piden ayuda para navegar el sistema de inmigración y localizar a familiares que han sido detenidos. Los miembros del personal pasan horas tratando de determinar dónde se encuentran los detenidos. Los residentes llegan preocupados porque sus seres queridos no tienen su medicina o ningún medio para comunicarse con ellos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vienen todos los días buscando ayuda”, dice Gutiérrez, de 53 años, quien pasó la temporada de fiestas entregando comestibles, bienes esenciales para el hogar y regalos. Él y su personal visitaron a familias que tenían miedo de salir de sus hogares por temor a ser detenidos o deportados.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El trabajo ha afectado a los trabajadores de las organizaciones sin fines de lucro y de defensa, dice, “Constantemente estás respondiendo llamadas telefónicas, correos electrónicos y mensajes de texto, tratando de proporcionar algún tipo de información”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dice que los defensores dieron la voz de alarma a principios del año pasado, pidiendo apoyo, especialmente después de ver lo que sucedió en Los Angeles en el verano, pero pocos fuera de la comunidad latina respondieron inicialmente.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A finales del año pasado, de repente la ciudad despertó”, cuenta Gutiérrez. “Vimos a personas de diversas comunidades levantándose y diciendo, ‘Esto no está bien’”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El hijo de inmigrantes mexicanos, Gutiérrez, que creció en La Villita, dice que conoce de primera mano el miedo y la resiliencia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La posible detención por parte de funcionarios federales de inmigración ha causado ansiedad y trauma generalizados, creando una necesidad de servicios de salud mental, dice. “Nuestra comunidad realmente ha estado en modo de respuesta de emergencia desde que comenzó el COVID, y no hemos parado”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estoy trabajando con directores de escuela y estamos hablando sobre los niños que van caminando a la escuela solos”, dice Gutiérrez. “Estamos hablando sobre la falta de participación en programas e incluso en los consejos escolares locales”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Es triste”, agrega. “Pero cuando hablo con residentes de la comunidad y los veo navegar el sistema, hablar con sus hijos, preparar a sus familias, hay tanta fuerza y belleza en cómo se levantan durante este tiempo”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gutiérrez dice que los residentes creen que los agentes de inmigración regresarán, pero se sienten más preparados.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Otras comunidades se están levantando y protestando, y así vamos a continuar el trabajo, y lo que venga, lo vamos a manejar”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alejandra, una madre inmigrante de tres hijos, es una madre activa. Durante años, ha inscrito a sus hijos en actividades extracurriculares y ha sido voluntaria en un grupo de apoyo para padres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mi mayor esperanza es que todos mis hijos crezcan para ser buenas personas y miembros ejemplares de la sociedad”, dice. “Depende de nosotros como padres guiarlos por el camino correcto”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Como muchas inmigrantes de México, Alejandra cuenta que llegó a Estados Unidos hace 20 años en busca de una vida mejor y más oportunidades para sus futuros hijos. Ella y su esposo querían criar a sus hijos en Pilsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero ahora, después de vivir la oleada de la aplicación de la ley federal de inmigración en otoño, está replanteando su participación en la comunidad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dijo que ha permitido tentativamente que sus hijos — uno en la secundaria y dos en la primaria — reanuden actividades extracurriculares como fútbol y el club de teatro que habían dejado de hacer en otoño.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero dice que eso puede cambiar en los próximos meses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aún estamos un poco asustados. Me preocupa que las personas que están de acuerdo con esta administración se comporten mal o de manera agresiva hacia nuestra comunidad. No quiero que mis hijos vean nada de eso”, agrega.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alejandra dice que Pilsen suele ser un lugar tranquilo y unido, pero que el sentido de seguridad se ha ido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nuestras vidas han cambiado.

La Shawn Ford, whom the congressman endorsed while announcing his retirement &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/07/30/danny-davis-wont-seek-reelection-congress\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;last summer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ford, advocate for regulating hemp products&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, Ford has served in the Illinois General Assembly, where he chairs the House appropriations committee for higher education.

But that's what happened,” said Ford, who once called on former Gov. Pat Quinn to deploy the National Guard in Chicago to address gun violence in 2010 — long before President Donald Trump’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/01/28/trump-deployment-national-guard-chicago-cost-taxpayers-21-million-congressional-report\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;effort to federalize troops&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for city patrols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It put a spotlight on crime… You need people that's bold, that will say things, but listen to what their constituents say,” Ford said. “This is not something that I would call for anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s not the only candidate carrying name recognition and a little political baggage into the March 17 primary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-490000\" name=\"image-490000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bb2c39d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7383x4144+0+390/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F7d%2F5a67bbdb4101adc06f0c9d037564%2Fcongress7th-260212-16-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c0db830/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7383x4144+0+390/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F7d%2F5a67bbdb4101adc06f0c9d037564%2Fcongress7th-260212-16-1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e6b23b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7383x4144+0+390/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F7d%2F5a67bbdb4101adc06f0c9d037564%2Fcongress7th-260212-16-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"CONGRESS7TH_260212-16.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e6b23b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7383x4144+0+390/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F7d%2F5a67bbdb4101adc06f0c9d037564%2Fcongress7th-260212-16-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d6882e4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7383x4144+0+390/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F7d%2F5a67bbdb4101adc06f0c9d037564%2Fcongress7th-260212-16-1.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e6b23b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7383x4144+0+390/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb2%2F7d%2F5a67bbdb4101adc06f0c9d037564%2Fcongress7th-260212-16-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Rep.

She also cares for her disabled sister who relies on federal food assistance and other social services that have been scaled back under Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think about people that don't have help like my sister does,” said Conyears-Ervin, who's endorsed by the Chicago Teachers Union. “Those are the things that drive me, and I don't believe there's any other candidate in this race that has that testimony.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Conyears-Ervin agreed to pay a $30,000 fine to the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2023/9/6/23861199/treasurer-conyears-ervin-ethics-abuse-of-power-allegations\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Chicago Board of Ethics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Bernard Kurzon, the 30-unit apartment building at 1224 W. Loyola Ave. was once home to businesses Archie’s Cafe, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/reset-with-sasha-ann-simons/2024/01/25/experimental-art-space-faces-uncertain-future-after-building-bought-by-loyola-university\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Roman Susan Gallery&lt;/a&gt; and Edge Art. It's next to the Loyola Red Line stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university purchased the site in 2024 for $3 million, according to the student newspaper &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://loyolaphoenix.com/2024/01/loyola-buys-local-property-displacing-residents-and-local-businesses/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Loyola Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;. It was issued a demolition permit on Jan. 5, according to city records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Loyola wouldn’t confirm the building’s purchase price, and pointed to a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://t.e2ma.net/message/tt81kt/1zayu35d\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Feb. 11 newsletter&lt;/a&gt; that included a statement by Associate Vice President Jennifer Clark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark acknowledged the demolition permit “has raised questions” about the site's future. She wrote the location is part of a future Chicago Transit Authority project, “meaning Loyola will not be the sole decision-maker regarding its long-term use. But, we are committed to stewarding the site responsibly and thoughtfully.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demolition is expected to take four to six weeks, depending on site conditions and the weather, according to the university. Once complete, it plans to improve the site with “upgraded fencing and new landscaping.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller said there was a push to make the building a Chicago landmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be eligible, a Chicago building must meet at least two of the seven criteria established by the city, which includes having city heritage, unique visual features or being designed by a notable architect. The building must also meet a more abstract “integrity criterion,” which Miller said can be tough for individual commercial buildings or homes to meet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Loyola Avenue building has a scalloped roof with Spanish clay tile and ornamentation along the roof and commercial windows. But there weren't enough elements “to fit all the strict requirements,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a20000\" name=\"image-a20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/586d7a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+163/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F08%2F97%2Fdd63a4ce4dfca846c9bcb7b553f9%2Floyola-260224-16.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a49cd3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+163/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F08%2F97%2Fdd63a4ce4dfca846c9bcb7b553f9%2Floyola-260224-16.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/02c6abc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+163/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F08%2F97%2Fdd63a4ce4dfca846c9bcb7b553f9%2Floyola-260224-16.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A sign saying &amp;quot;Keep out.

It’s a building that we may see elsewhere in the city, but it was very special to people in Rogers Park.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller said Preservation Chicago regularly hears from residents accusing Loyola of “land banking” sites, or holding on to vacant land. It's a practice some residents believe will happen at 1224 W. Loyola, as the university has yet to announce development plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's really tragic that we're losing a nice building that’s got a lot of history,” Miller said. “Demolition is often times the answer with these university expansions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archie’s had circulated a petition in 2024 that called on Loyola to make its development plans more inclusive of neighbors and small businesses. Roman Susan, which started at the Loyola Avenue building, also issued a similar call in late 2024 for the university to recognize the importance of the building and its tenants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Roman Susan founder Kristin Abhalter Smith told the Commission on Chicago Landmarks that more than 1,500 people signed an open letter to Loyola. “I strongly believe that our combined communities of thousands of supporters wouldn’t exist without the location, shape and design of this distinctive piece of architecture,” Abhalter Smith said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller said he hopes universities like Loyola don’t demolish buildings until they have development plans and funding in place. He also urged alderpersons to consider creating landmark districts as a way to save buildings like 1224 W. Loyola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Landmark districts don't necessarily need to be buildings that are museum pieces captured in time and cannot evolve. Landmark districts are a way of encouraging the preservation of the look, feel and the spirit of the district, but it does allow for new construction,” Miller said. “These kinds of districts are really planning tools that encourage sensitive planning and development, and I think we need more of that in Chicago.”&lt;/p&gt;",

He had been traveling the district for months, “exploring” a run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson Jr., 60, said he has some unfinished business after leaving Congress in 2012 amid mental health issues, and ultimately, federal charges lodged against him for misusing his campaign funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My campaign is about connecting the second congressional district of Illinois to the global economy. That's the unfinished work of my 17 years of service in the Congress,” Jackson Jr., referring to his longtime push for a third Chicago airport in Peotone. “...That's the unfinished work of what's missing on the economy of the South Side of Chicago.

make it even more popular than it is today by including dental, vision and hearing and bringing more Americans into the system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And despite behind-the-scenes rumblings from other campaigns about Jackson Jr.’s mental health struggles, the former congressman said he has been open with his struggles — noting members of Congress have access to mental health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've struggled with depression all of my life,” Jackson Jr. said. “So did Martin Luther King Jr., so have other U.S presidents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson Jr. said he’s heard from young voters with mental health struggles — noting many are from a generation that has grappled with school shootings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am particularly grateful for at least the conscious observation that I've made with young people who are far more understanding of mental health than you know, say, even the older generation,” Jackson Jr. said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if a congressional win will move him one step away from his past, Jackson Jr. said he’s grappled with his mistakes, and he expects them “to present themselves in different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've come to accept who I am,” Jackson Jr. said. “I've come to accept the mistakes that I've made in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘I’m part of the community’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller is serving her second term as 6th District commissioner on the Cook County Board. She is pushing for Medicare for All, maternal health and reproductive justice and for good jobs and lower costs for working families, among other policy priorities. She served on the board of Planned Parenthood of Illinois and said she would push for Congress to codify Roe v. Wade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there has been a glaring spotlight on Miller’s fundraising. According to Federal Election Commission disclosures for October to December, Miller reported at least $875,000 from donors who have given to American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) or its affiliated super PAC, the United Democracy Project, since 2023. Peters’ campaign is also pointing to money they say is coming from Trump donors. And Jewish Insider and other outlets have reported that newly formed super PACs Elect Chicago Women and Affordable Chicago Now are running ads boosting Miller, State Sen. Laura Fine in her 9th Congressional District run and former Rep. Melissa Bean in her 8th District run. All three are viewed as moderate pro-Israel candidates. Those PACs won't have to disclose their donors until close to Election Day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-ac0000\" name=\"image-ac0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4e84cc0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5891x3306+0+310/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe8%2Fd1b58187421787f5a1a8a53a5107%2Fstrogerpresser-010126-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a3896e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5891x3306+0+310/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe8%2Fd1b58187421787f5a1a8a53a5107%2Fstrogerpresser-010126-10.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/707119f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5891x3306+0+310/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe8%2Fd1b58187421787f5a1a8a53a5107%2Fstrogerpresser-010126-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"ook County Commissioner Donna Miller attends a news conference at the Cook County Health Professional Building in the Illinois Medical District.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/707119f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5891x3306+0+310/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe8%2Fd1b58187421787f5a1a8a53a5107%2Fstrogerpresser-010126-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/82fcb7e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5891x3306+0+310/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe8%2Fd1b58187421787f5a1a8a53a5107%2Fstrogerpresser-010126-10.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/707119f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5891x3306+0+310/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe8%2Fd1b58187421787f5a1a8a53a5107%2Fstrogerpresser-010126-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook County Commissioner Donna Miller. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't have any MAGA donors.

About 44% of the 400 likely primary voters were undecided. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My record is strong with voters. People have seen me out in the community. I'm part of the community, and have been for decades now,” Miller said. “I didn't leave and never come back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘Broader, bigger version’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters, who was appointed to the state Senate in 2019 to succeed Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, says he’s been talking about Medicare for All since 2015 and abolishing ICE since 2019. And he’s been attacking large financial institutions for their impact on housing for almost a decade as an organizer, then as a state senator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s just the fact that I have a pretty strong track record of actually fighting for these policies,” Peters said. “Taking on the insurance industry and passing the Illinois Healthcare Protection Act with the governor. Taking on the fact that our hospital infrastructure, healthcare infrastructure has been chronically underfunded. When I was the chair of the Senate Black caucus, pushing to move hundreds of millions of dollars to safety net hospitals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div

schools “to rebuild the next generation of carpenters, plumbers and electricians.” He was also among a vocal minority to protest House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ push to further gerrymander Illinois districts last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, when it came down to us here in the second congressional district in the state of Illinois, gerrymandering here was not something that we should have engaged in,” Preston said. “And I was very vocal to the point that leader Jeffries came to the city of Chicago to meet with myself in particular, and some other leaders in the Black Caucus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preston said his pushback to stretching the district all the way to the Kentucky border makes him stand out in the crowded field to replace Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

They didn't say a word. And so they were willing to give away the people of the 2nd congressional district, because they wanted to be good boys and good girls and not have any type of confrontation with the party leader,” Preston said. “And to me, I think that that is a failure in leadership, and it's evidence that they don't have a fighting bone inside their bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighting words aside, Preston has had to speak out about reports of a past domestic violence charge — and previous comments he made online about former President Joe Biden. He called the criminal charge “the least proud moment” of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn't lie about it. I admitted it. I am a radically transparent person, and that is something we need in this party. That's what we need. We need somebody that's radically transparent,” Preston said. “Because people aren't stupid and the same old, same old tactics won't work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Packed field&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown served as village clerk of Matteson, and currently as a Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Commissioner. She said she’s running because she believes in environmental justice, clean water and safe streets, affordable healthcare, jobs that pay a living wage and strong public schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regis said he helped secure millions in federal funding for local governments, small businesses and nonprofits while working in Kelly’s office. As director of strategy at a Chicago-based environmental nonprofit, he leads clean energy and climate resilience initiatives in neighborhoods that need investment. He says that experience would equip him to advocate for affordable housing, public safety, environmental equity and economic opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France, a strategist, says the state must extend existing public transportation and expand airports to support the movement of cargo and passenger traffic. He also supports expanding affordable housing in the district and by pushing federal down payment assistance programs for first-time buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keating, a Flossmoor resident, is a trial and appellate lawyer. He calls himself a “common sense Democrat,” and says Democrats and a functioning Congress “must be defined by what we as the majority are for, not just who we are against.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore, who worked on several political campaigns, also ran for Illinois Secretary of State in 2022. He says he’s not a career politician and isn’t run by party politics or special interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe Congress needs more everyday people who understand what working families go through,” Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;",

He now brings resources to fellow troops after he was pulled back to help care for a sick relative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koledova is still checking in on loved ones facing down bullets and bombs.  Most days she waits for a short message from a friend on the front line: “450” means he’s “safe and OK.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But sometimes there’s no answer,” Koledova said. “Whenever we don't receive a message, there’s anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Koledova, a Vernon Hills resident who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine 19 years ago, the fight for her home country is her “daily life.” Her husband is a Ukrainian diplomat, and her father has been running meals and supplies to soldiers since the start of the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 1.8 million soldiers have been killed, wounded or are missing on both sides, according to a report last month by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank. But that number doesn’t include many of Koledova’s loved ones who have returned from the battlefield with mental health struggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been very hard for them to return to a normal life,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e60000\" name=\"image-e60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c74250d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F43%2F0a%2Ff15ca79a48d2b1fcc714a6acf3e7%2Fukraineanniversary-260224-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18cecad/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F43%2F0a%2Ff15ca79a48d2b1fcc714a6acf3e7%2Fukraineanniversary-260224-10.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b116b7b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F43%2F0a%2Ff15ca79a48d2b1fcc714a6acf3e7%2Fukraineanniversary-260224-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Oksana Koledova, owner of a Ukrainian grocery store called Varenychok located at 4840 N.

Human Rights Monitoring Mission. Russian peace proposals would require Ukraine to give up territory and abandon any hope of joining NATO, which she said was unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There are no people in the world who want this war to end more than we do,\" she said. \"We are in a Russia-orchestrated trap.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koledova returned from Kyiv on Monday and said life there has both changed and remained the same.

And they’re still pleading for the Cook County state’s attorney’s office to drop the case altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That relationship that she was in, she was at risk and her baby was at risk every single day,” Julie Koehler, of the Cook County public defender’s office, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every single minute that she was in that relationship, she was in danger and it was only a matter of time before something like this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-6c0000\" name=\"image-6c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f1df149/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F84%2F079a645e454aba11b5043d2bd73d%2Fdomestickilling-260224-03.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a4b47bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F84%2F079a645e454aba11b5043d2bd73d%2Fdomestickilling-260224-03.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18f5df9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F84%2F079a645e454aba11b5043d2bd73d%2Fdomestickilling-260224-03.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"DOMESTICKILLING_260224-03.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18f5df9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F84%2F079a645e454aba11b5043d2bd73d%2Fdomestickilling-260224-03.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5871c9a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F84%2F079a645e454aba11b5043d2bd73d%2Fdomestickilling-260224-03.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18f5df9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F84%2F079a645e454aba11b5043d2bd73d%2Fdomestickilling-260224-03.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julie Koehler, Keshia Golden’s public defender, stands at The Freedom Defense Center of Austin on Feb. 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A celebration turns violent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 22, 2022, Golden and her boyfriend, Calvin Sidney, were &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2022/10/30/23429205/calvin-sydney-dead-pregnant-woman-charged-murder-father-keshia-golden-domestic-violence\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;hosting a baby shower&lt;/a&gt; for their first child together. They were surrounded by family, friends, food and lots of gifts, Golden recalls. But after the party, something shifted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golden said the group went back to her West Side home, and Sidney started fighting with a friend. When she tried to intervene, Golden said Sidney pushed her down the stairs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she left briefly but returned when Sidney promised he’d calmed down. Then a mundane argument over the microwave escalated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From that, I really feel like I blanked out, because all I know is my face was on the counter for asking a question,” Golden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He slammed her into the counter, then the fridge, according to Assistant Public Defender Kyan Keenan. A relative tried to separate them, but Sidney wouldn’t relent, so Golden grabbed a knife and stabbed him in the leg, Keenan said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e90000\" name=\"image-e90000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cf64d05/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1118x627+0+710/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F1a%2F262efaa103b55a24e624c0f1457f%2Fkeshia-golden.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c9d3617/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1118x627+0+710/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F1a%2F262efaa103b55a24e624c0f1457f%2Fkeshia-golden.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/609027d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1118x627+0+710/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F1a%2F262efaa103b55a24e624c0f1457f%2Fkeshia-golden.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Keshia Golden (left) at her baby shower Oct. 22.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/609027d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1118x627+0+710/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F1a%2F262efaa103b55a24e624c0f1457f%2Fkeshia-golden.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0f49ac6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1118x627+0+710/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F1a%2F262efaa103b55a24e624c0f1457f%2Fkeshia-golden.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/609027d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1118x627+0+710/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F1a%2F262efaa103b55a24e624c0f1457f%2Fkeshia-golden.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keshia Golden (left) at her baby shower on Oct. 22, 2022, hours before prosecutors say she killed Calvin Sidney, the father of her then-unborn child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was hit in his femoral artery and later died at Mount Sinai Hospital, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After the stab, I just ran out of the house,” Golden said. “I wasn't thinking clearly. I just wanted him to stop basically. I didn't know that it hit an artery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidney’s family couldn’t be reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t unusual for the couple to go from “a good time to a bad time,” according to Golden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had previously called police more than 50 times to report abuse, the public defender's said. Between June and September of 2022, police responded to five domestic violence incidents involving Golden and Sidney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In four of them, Golden said Sidney had choked, punched, slapped or pushed her. In one case, Sidney accused her of stabbing him in the neck, prosecutors said. He was hospitalized, but didn’t press charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, Golden took out an order of protection against Sidney after he allegedly punched her in the face, according to court records and police reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pregnant behind bars&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Golden said she went home about 30 minutes after the stabbing, not knowing Sidney had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was taken into custody and had to be hospitalized for a few days to address her own injuries. In the meantime, a Cook County judge &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2022/10/25/23423307/2m-bail-woman-accused-fatally-stabbing-boyfriend-argument-over-microwave-use\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;set her bond at $2 million&lt;/a&gt;. Golden wasn't present for the hearing and hadn’t spoken to her lawyers yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the judge originally set a $2 million bond in that courtroom, I lost my mind,” said Koehler, deputy chief of the public defender’s homicide task force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Koehler called Mom’s United Against Violence and Incarceration and the Chicago Community Bond Fund to raise awareness and the money needed to get Golden out of jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a40000\" name=\"image-a40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3553b40/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+134/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fea%2Fdd%2Fc1cc4a21f75320503284bfe77857%2Fmerlin-3769941.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aaae63e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+134/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fea%2Fdd%2Fc1cc4a21f75320503284bfe77857%2Fmerlin-3769941.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/716edd2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+134/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fea%2Fdd%2Fc1cc4a21f75320503284bfe77857%2Fmerlin-3769941.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Cook County Jail near 26th Street and California Avenue. ****FILE ART OF COOK COUNTY JAIL**** 02-15-06 Cook County Jail, 26th and California, Chicago - A woman walks along the west side of Cook County Jail on S.

Separating out the accumulated interest, the total in illegally assessed fines and penalties adds up to roughly $163 million.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city's Law Department issued a statement saying City Hall is considering an appeal of Sullivan's ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, the city raised the fine for out-of-date city sticker violations from $100 to $200, with a $200 charge for late payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit also lists more than a dozen offenses — including having window tinting that is too dark or parking in a loading zone — that carry penalties of at least $140 and as high as $500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2022/5/6/23060313/chicago-parking-sticker-tickets-class-action-lawsuit\"   &gt;Appeals court ruling revives Chicago ticket lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kyle Garchar, one of two named plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit, racked up four city sticker violations within weeks in 2017 and 2018 while parking on the street in front of his house. Garchar said the $1,600 debt he racked up deprived him of his ability to earn money from his job as a ride-share driver, after the city notified Uber and Lyft about his unpaid tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The city has tried to extract as much as they can to make up for the poor financial decisions they’ve made,” Garchar, 35, told the Chicago Sun-Times. “Everyone has received a ticket they feel is not necessarily legitimate. But even if you fight it and go to administrative court, city employees are not like judges in a typical court. Unless there’s some sort of clerical error or typo or any inconsistency you can find, there’s no way to get out of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garchar said drivers who tend to rack up the most tickets are “already broke” or struggling to pay bills, adding that the city has a “history of perpetuating that cycle of debt.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Blaha got five city sticker tickets in four weeks in 2013 — and five more in a month in 2015 — while working as a service worker searching for legal parking. He said while  the city’s impending refund will not amount to “life-changing money,”  he hopes it “sets a precedent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s another way of exposing the city, and how they are trying to take advantage of the people in it and basically stealing from the people,\" Blaha said. \"It’s great that they finally have to answer to that … abuse of power.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law department spokesperson Kristen Cabanban issued a statement saying although the city respects the \"judicial process, we are actively evaluating all available legal options, including an appeal. ... This matter is not final, and the city intends to continue vigorously defending the interests of its residents. We will have no further comment while the litigation is ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was originally filed in 2018, the final year of Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly four years later, the city changed the law to eliminate the cap-exceeding  penalties — a tacit admission that it had been breaching  the $250 state limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City attorney Mark Siegel admitted the violations  during a  2022 Finance Committee. meeting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overcharged drivers were represented by attorney Jacie Zolna, whose law firm, Myron M. Cherry &amp;amp; Associates, won a $38.75 million settlement against the city over late fees tacked on to red-light and speed camera tickets. Zolna said there’s a reason why state law established the $250 limit when it granted Chicago the power to create a “quasi-court” system that allows city employees to serve as judge and jury, making  it “nearly impossible to contest a violation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The trade-off that the General Assembly made was, 'OK, we will give the city the ability to adjudicate these tickets in this system that is tilted in its favor, but in exchange, you’re not going to be able to hammer people with the fines and penalties,'\" Zolna said. “For a decade, citizens upheld their side of that bargain while they got railroaded every time they got one of these tickets. But the city didn’t uphold their side of the bargain. They started charging people way more than they should have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zolna said he has offered to settle the case for “considerably less” than $163.5 million — only to be repeatedly rebuffed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now the city is out of bullets,” he said. “They could try to delay and appeal. But that would just go up to the appellate court that swatted them down three years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;",

That’s the year Giannoulias won his current elected post, replacing retiring incumbent Jesse White to oversee a government agency responsible for driver licenses and vehicle registrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Mandera and his family have collectively given nearly $30,000 more over the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes a $6,900 “in-kind” contribution to Giannoulias from Mandera in 2024 in the form of a Cubs suite for a fundraiser, according to Illinois State Board of Elections records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giannoulias and Mandera declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandera’s company and family have donated to another potential mayoral candidate, Ald. Bill Conway (34th), giving $20,000 to his campaign since 2022, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in the 1990s, Mandera ran the topless club under several names, from Thee Dollhouse to VIP’s, A Gentlemen’s Club to The Crazy Horse Too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pascente, a former Chicago cop known to associate with the late mobster Anthony Spilotro, was listed in a 1997 Chicago Crime Commission report on the Chicago mob as a known member or associate of organized crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"  data-align-floatRight&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d40000\" name=\"image-d40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72f254d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/642x360+0+296/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F01%2F539526e3446793ee696efeab2617%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-22-at-11-05-04-pm.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f40cd42/2147483647/strip/true/crop/642x360+0+296/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F01%2F539526e3446793ee696efeab2617%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-22-at-11-05-04-pm.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8387c5c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/642x360+0+296/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F01%2F539526e3446793ee696efeab2617%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-22-at-11-05-04-pm.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mob figure Fred Pascente&amp;#x27;s book in which he describes working with Perry Mandera at his Near North Side strip club.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8387c5c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/642x360+0+296/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F01%2F539526e3446793ee696efeab2617%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-22-at-11-05-04-pm.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8f2bad9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/642x360+0+296/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F01%2F539526e3446793ee696efeab2617%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-22-at-11-05-04-pm.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8387c5c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/642x360+0+296/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F01%2F539526e3446793ee696efeab2617%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-22-at-11-05-04-pm.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mob figure Fred Pascente’s book in which he describes working with Perry Mandera at his Near North Side strip club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevada gambling regulators banned Pascente from stepping foot in any casinos there, calling him “an associate of the Chicago organized crime family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pascente died in 2014 not long before his autobiography was released. Titled “Mob Cop: My Life of Crime in the Chicago Police Department,” the book includes passages about Mandera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pascente wrote: “We opened Thee Dollhouse in February of ’93. The owner was Perry Mandera. I was the main guy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I used to give Perry twenty-five thousand a week. I controlled the money. Every night I counted the money. So I know, &lt;i&gt;badda-bing&lt;/i&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandera also brought in Rick Rizzolo to help with the club at one point. Rizzolo had been running a Las Vegas strip club that employed reputed mob figure Rocco Lombardo, brother of the late mob boss Joey “The Clown” Lombardo.  Rizzolo had alleged ties to others in organized crime in Chicago and New York, according to published accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rizzolo’s Las Vegas club has been described in a court case involving a patron who was beaten and paralyzed there in 2001 as “infested by a rogues' gallery of thugs, thieves, drug pushers and corrupt ex-cops. Most, if not all, have well documented ties to organized crime figures.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rizzolo couldn’t be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandera eventually sold his Chicago club, which had been involved in a long legal battle with City Hall over its liquor license and how much skin was allowed to be shown by female dancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another legal fight came in 2002 when a Mandera trucking firm called the Custom Companies was hit with a sexual harassment complaint from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which alleged that women working at the business were made to bring clients to Mandera’s strip club and subjected to a “sexually charged” workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-710000\" name=\"image-710000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4f41b54/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2012x1129+0+150/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F97%2Fdc%2Fce88e478467f912d949a940487b3%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-23-at-11-22-42-am.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a6b104/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2012x1129+0+150/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F97%2Fdc%2Fce88e478467f912d949a940487b3%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-23-at-11-22-42-am.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9ba0e6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2012x1129+0+150/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F97%2Fdc%2Fce88e478467f912d949a940487b3%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-23-at-11-22-42-am.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Among the recent campaign contributions to Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias from Perry Mandera and businesses affiliated with him.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9ba0e6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2012x1129+0+150/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F97%2Fdc%2Fce88e478467f912d949a940487b3%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-23-at-11-22-42-am.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/29dc857/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2012x1129+0+150/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F97%2Fdc%2Fce88e478467f912d949a940487b3%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-23-at-11-22-42-am.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9ba0e6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2012x1129+0+150/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F97%2Fdc%2Fce88e478467f912d949a940487b3%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-23-at-11-22-42-am.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the recent campaign contributions to Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias from Perry Mandera and businesses affiliated with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois State Board of Elections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandera’s Custom Companies has also contributed money to a trade group representing the trucking industry that in turn has given campaign money to Giannoulias, whose agency licenses and regulates truckers in Illinois.

Golden said that when her boyfriend threw her against a counter, she thought she and her unborn child were going to die. Then, after she fought back and fatally stabbed him, she thought she would spend the rest of her life behind bars, she said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Her release&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Golden was eventually released from jail, thanks to a team of advocates and lawyers who rallied around her. She was able to give birth and raise her daughter on the outside. It has been \"the best thing that ever happened\" to her, Golden told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pending trial&lt;/b&gt;: Now she’s preparing for trial and is fearful that a jury won’t see her side of the story. Golden is due back in court next week.&amp;nbsp;Her lawyers plan to argue she was acting in self-defense against a man with a history of abuse. But they’re pleading for the Cook County state’s attorney’s office to drop the case altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjjitg-l-d/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;WAR IN UKRAINE 🇺🇦&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d00000\" name=\"image-d00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e15a9e5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fae%2F48%2Fe046a09a4b7889543bc3be8da186%2Fukraineanniversary-260224-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/47784b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fae%2F48%2Fe046a09a4b7889543bc3be8da186%2Fukraineanniversary-260224-2.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a346352/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fae%2F48%2Fe046a09a4b7889543bc3be8da186%2Fukraineanniversary-260224-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Oksana Koledova, owner of a Ukrainian grocery store called Varenychok located at 4840 N.

But that doesn’t include many who have returned from the battlefield with mental health struggles,&amp;nbsp;Koledova said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seeking refuge&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Iryna Potishma is among some of the 5.9 million refugees who have fled the country as Russia continues to occupy Ukrainian territory. More than 40,000 Ukrainians have found new homes in the Chicago area. Potishma's loved ones back home have mostly been spared from the battle, though months ago, missiles struck a building near her brother’s apartment.

&gt;Robert Herguth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donor history&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;For years, businessman Perry Mandera ran a topless bar on the Near North Side, at times with help from reputed organized crime associates, including the late \"mob cop\" Fred Pascente.&amp;nbsp;These days,&amp;nbsp;Mandera, his&amp;nbsp;family and their businesses are contributing heavily to the campaign fund benefitting Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The haul&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;With Giannoulias a potential candidate for Chicago mayor, companies affiliated with Mandera have contributed at least $80,000 to Citizens for Giannoulias since 2022. That’s the year Giannoulias won his current elected post. Beyond that, Mandera and his family have collectively given nearly $30,000 more over the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key context&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Pascente, a former Chicago cop known to associate with the late mobster Anthony Spilotro, was listed in a 1997 Chicago Crime Commission report as a known member or associate of organized crime.&amp;nbsp;Pascente died in 2014, not long before his autobiography was released. Titled \"Mob Cop: My Life of Crime in the Chicago Police Department,\" the book includes passages about Mandera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjjitg-l-p/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;MORE NEWS YOU NEED 🗞️&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-920000\" name=\"image-920000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cff8e91/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2F37%2Fd7d007c943eb8595274ec8fcb696%2Fimg-2967.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5470128/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2F37%2Fd7d007c943eb8595274ec8fcb696%2Fimg-2967.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/112a5f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2F37%2Fd7d007c943eb8595274ec8fcb696%2Fimg-2967.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Yoni Pizer&amp;#x27;s rental car and a truck on fire in a Puerto Vallarta street as violence spread across the area after the Mexican army killed New Generation Jalisco Cartel, Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, known as “El Mencho.&amp;quot;\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/112a5f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2F37%2Fd7d007c943eb8595274ec8fcb696%2Fimg-2967.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b8122b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2F37%2Fd7d007c943eb8595274ec8fcb696%2Fimg-2967.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/112a5f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2F37%2Fd7d007c943eb8595274ec8fcb696%2Fimg-2967.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jonathan Pizer’s rental car and a truck on fire in Puerto Vallarta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"line-height: inherit; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 24px; padding: 0px; list-style-type: disc;\" id=\"rte-742d4945-118a-11f1-9503-0dbc8aae0681\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjjitg-l-a/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Ex-state rep in Jalisco&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Jonathan \"Yoni\"&amp;nbsp;Pizer told the Sun-Times he was on vacation&amp;nbsp;Sunday in&amp;nbsp;Puerto Vallarta when he was forced out of his rental car at gunpoint.

Versluis, passengers get a life jacket and a set of ear plugs, because things can get \"loud and crunchy.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Versluis sets off from its mooring at Navy Pier one morning in early February, the sound of its 126-ton steel hull shuddering through ice grates on the ear like a trash compactor chomping rocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"For the first couple of years, when you’re smacking up against ice, it’s really nerve-racking. You just feel like that ice is going to pop right through the hull,\" said Eddie Popelas, who served as the tugboat’s engineer from 2002 to 2013 and whose father was at one time the boat’s captain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Capt. Billy Meilicke and Marine Engineer Rich Frizelis — in charge of the tugboat on this morning — the noise is just part of the daily soundtrack that includes the thrum of the 850-horsepower diesel engine and the single blast of the foghorn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjjitg-l-th/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;WATCH: ABOARD AN ICE BREAKER ▶️&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUtsLzLDmL-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

They also could save salary-cap space by trading wide receiver DJ Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Kmet and Swift seem safe. The Combine has a way of speeding up trade talks throughout the league, which could open opportunities for the Bears that would require them to create extra cap space, but general manager Ryan Poles currently plans on those two being on the team this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel pretty good about [them] being here, but again, there’s a lot more calls coming in on interest in some of these guys, so we have to sequence that out to see how it impacts our team,” Poles said Tuesday. “I’ve talked about cost of replacement, so what does that look like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know what we need to do, but any new, unique opportunities that might pop up are usually going to pop up here, and then we’ll get back and sort it all out and make decisions, but I feel pretty good about those guys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift rushed for a career-high 1,087 yards and nine touchdowns last season and told the Sun-Times recently &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/16/bears-rb-dandre-swift-hopes-he-convinced-team-to-keep-him-heading-into-final-year-of-contract\"   &gt;he hoped his performance was convincing enough to keep him with the Bears&lt;/a&gt;. He’s set to count $8.8 million against the cap this season, the final one of his deal, though the Bears could cut him for a dead-cap hit of $1.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kmet had a down year with just 30 catches for 347 yards and two touchdowns as the Bears incorporated first-round pick Colston Loveland into the offense. Kmet has two years, $23.2 million left on his contract with an out this offseason at $3.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poles was noncommittal on the future of Edmunds and Moore. He sidestepped a question about releasing Edmunds, who would cost $17.4 million or could be released for $2.4 million, and spoke highly of Moore, saying he’s “happy with him” while leaving the door open for a trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve got to have conversations and see what is the best combination of players we can bring in,” Poles said. “We want him here. We think highly of him. He’s a great teammate. He’s been productive consistently over the last couple years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have nothing but great things to say about him, but this is the time that you have to look at all the different scenarios and see what can allow us to put the best team out there.

He will become even more relevant if he keeps this up for the rest of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibility of him developing into a bottom-six NHL player with some scoring pop seems to be back on the table, albeit far from assured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Gavin [has] had a lot of opportunities,\" Rockford coach Jared Nightingale said. \"They weren't going in for him, but he kept a really good attitude and showed up with the same mindset each day, wanting to get better. I'm happy for him. He's had all those chances, and now they're starting to go in.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;JUST 30 SECONDS INTO THE GAME⏱️ &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/12IJKnbWYA\"&gt;https://t.co/12IJKnbWYA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/JuYmQPATvO\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JuYmQPATvO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rockford IceHogs (@goicehogs) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/goicehogs/status/2025378580578873493?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 22, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayes earned his first pro hat trick Saturday against San Diego. After scoring two pretty goals off rushes in the first period, he capped it off with a scrappy goal from the low slot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the rematch Sunday, his confidence was noticeably high as he maneuvered assertively around the offensive zone and tapped his stick to call for the puck whenever he slipped open. He didn't score, but he did generate one Grade A chance with a nifty deflection in front of the net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Gavin is really smart about being in the right spots at the right times,\" Nightingale said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His ice time has increased in accordance with his play. After starting the season on the fourth line, he has become a staple in Rockford's top six and power-play units, taking advantage of open roles in the lineup created by injuries and call-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It was a slow start, and then I got in a groove and started playing a little bit more and started shooting the puck a little bit more, and the confidence came with that,\" Hayes said. \"Bounces started going my way.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's listed at 6-1, but he looks taller than that in person, and his physicality has also increased markedly this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"[I'm] holding onto [the puck] a little bit more, making plays, because I can see the ice pretty well,\" he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow Hawks forward prospect Marek Vanacker previously mentioned Hyman as a stylistic model of his, too, although that might be in part because Hyman's family now owns the OHL club, Brantford, that Vanacker (and previously Nick Lardis) plays for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there's no denying the fact Hyman has carved out quite a career as a complementary winger with a knack for burying goals around the net, somewhat similarly to Hawks forward Tyler Bertuzzi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realistically, Hayes probably won't become a 54-goal scorer in the NHL. But considering he's only 21 (turning 22 in May),&amp;nbsp;he could have plenty of development ahead of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the Hawks' &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2022/7/8/23200431/blackhawks-draft-picks-2022-nhl-paul-ludwinski-ryan-greene-gavin-hayes-samuel-savoie\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Day Two draft picks&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, Ryan Greene has already established himself as an NHL player while Hayes has begun to pace ahead of Samuel Savoie, Aidan Thompson and Paul Ludwinski (who are all also in Rockford). Meanwhile, sixth-round pick Dominic James' NHL success with the Lightning is frustrating to witness from afar.&lt;/p&gt;",

Tenía 12 años cuando se enteró de su estatus migratorio y descubrió que su padre tenía miedo de llenar cualquier documento que pudiera atraer la atención a su estatus migratorio. Un maestro de música de la Secundaria Lane Tech la ayudó a ser aceptada en la Merit School of Music, y la escuela finalmente la ayudó a finalizar sus estudios universitarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee obtuvo un doctorado en la Manhattan School of Music y ha enseñado allí desde 2011.

I was hired. I would think that they would get two third-round picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s just my perspective. I wouldn’t be sitting here if it weren’t for them giving me that job and helping me grow to get this job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cunningham worked as assistant general manager from 2022 through last season. The Falcons hired him Jan. 29, and the Bears promoted Jeff King to his former spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the NFL reverses its position, the Bears would receive a compensatory third-round pick this year and next. While Poles was clear that has nothing to do with supporting Cunningham’s career advancement, he believed the Bears should get the benefit of the policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m really proud that Ian has an opportunity to be a general manager — something we’ve talked about for a long time,” Poles said. “How we [developed and supported him] and why we do that has nothing to do with comp whatsoever, and I want to make that very clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the other side of it, there’s a set of rules that were put in place that can be applied to this situation.

This one got laughs. Then he got serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears have had teams call about Bagent's availability. They haven't said no. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I love Tyson,\" Johnson said. \"And that’s one that kind of pulls at your heartstrings a little bit because he’s someone that you care about so deeply and he’s a hell of a football player that at some point you want to see him have a chance to do it himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"And so we’ll always do what’s best for our team and our organization. I do think there’s a lot of merit to having a strong No. 2 quarterback, which he certainly fits that bill. I’m of the mind that he’s probably one of the best 32 of the NFL. His preseason tape over the last couple years has probably confirmed that, in my opinion. But if I took myself out of the equation, I want what’s best for him. If he would like an opportunity to start I certainly hope he can get that somewhere.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than shoot down a trade possibility Tuesday at the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/23/bears-nfl-scouting-combine-four-questions-ryan-poles-ben-johnson-salary-cap-space-tremaine-edmunds-draft-defensive-line-offensive-trade-maxx-crosby-raiders\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;NFL Scouting Combine&lt;/a&gt;, Bears GM Ryan Poles called any potential move an “interesting dynamic that we’re going to have to work through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poles plucked Bagent out of Div. II Shepherd University and he quickly won the Bears' backup job in 2023. Poles and Johnson so value Bagent that they gave him a two-year, $10 million extension last year that runs though the end of the 2027 season. The Bears haven’t needed him the last two years, though — with Caleb Williams making every start, Bagent has thrown just six passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams’ perfect run of health won’t continue forever, though. If the Bears trade him, they’d have to find a solid backup to take his place. The Bears would probably need a Day 2 draft pick just to consider a move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears anticipated teams would call about Bagent’s availability given a weak free agent and rookie class at quarterback. He's cheap and has been effective — in his four rookie starts and all three preseasons of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The tough thing is, with what Ben thinks about Tyson, what I think about Tyson, what our locker room thinks about Tyson, that’s a really tough decision for us,” Poles said. “But for Tyson as well, I think he would have an opportunity to go and perform for a team and do some really good things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But again, you’ve got to weigh the short-term and the long-term. Now, what’s the cost for replacement? We spent a lot of time developing him. Ben spent a lot of time developing him.”&lt;/p&gt;",

Others are accusing Democrats of being beholden to interests that will benefit President Donald Trump’s administration — a clearly unpopular issue for Democrats in a primary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems like easy pickings for the types of giant corporate interest that wants to come in and spend,” said Reed Showalter, a candidate in the&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/what-to-know-about-illinois-7th-congressional-district-democratic-primary\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt; 7th Congressional District&lt;/a&gt;. “A few million dollars to buy a seat in Congress is a good deal. And for the rest of everybody who’s playing a grassroots game, that is a very damaging thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showalter is one of several candidates speaking out about the influence of super PACs in this primary cycle — in an unprecedented year with four open congressional seats and a Senate seat open in Illinois.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Israel Public Affairs Committee — the powerful pro-Israel organization — &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/19/rep-jan-schakowsky-withdrawal-donna-miller-endorsement-2nd-congressional-district-aipac-support\"   &gt;is playing a role&lt;/a&gt; in four congressional races in Illinois — helping to boost Cook County Commissioner Donna Miller in the 2nd; former U.S. Rep. Melissa Bean in the 8th; state Sen. Laura Fine in the 9th; and Chicago City Treasurer Melissa Conyears Ervin in the 7th. United Democracy Project, AIPAC’s affiliated super PAC, has spent more than $753,000 directly to support Conyears Ervin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/what-to-know-2nd-congressional-district-democratic-primary\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;The 2nd District&lt;/a&gt; is especially hit hard by super PAC influence, with Fairshake, a pro-crypto PAC funded primarily by Trump megadonors and business partners Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, targeting state Sen. Robert Peters. Fairshake is spending at least $1 million to run anti-Peters ads. And it’s the third Trump-affiliated super PAC to play a role in the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andreessen is the founder and general partner of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz — and a Trump adviser on tech and business policy — and he gave more than $4.7 million to advance the MAGA agenda in the 2023 and 2024 electoral cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affordable Chicago Now!, which is AIPAC-affiliated, is spending money in support of Miller, while the Leading the Future PAC, funded by OpenAI stakeholders, is backing former Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. in the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters’ campaign says Fairshake is targeting him because he voted for crypto state legislation that imposed new rules on digital asset firms. Peters co-sponsored the measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think any time big right wing billionaire donors come into a race, it’s like a jolt,” Peters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters said all three entities “are scared of having an effective progressive champion in this seat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a whole group of really corrupt billionaires who have really close attachment to the Trump administration, who want people who are going to be soft on their issues, and so that means people who are going to be OK with unconditional military aid in [Israel Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu’s war machine,\" Peters said. \"That means people who are going to be OK with the advancement of AI slop and the increase in utility rates. That means people who are OK with the corrupt practices of the crypto bros who have been literally benefiting from the Trump administration, and I believe have played a role in Trump’s ability to gain more wealth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junaid Ahmed, a candidate in the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/what-to-know-about-illinois-8th-congressional-district-democratic-primary\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;8th Congressional District,&lt;/a&gt; is a progressive  endorsed by the Sunrise Movement, who is also railing against the influence of super PACs. He’s frustrated that mailers call Bean an “architect of Obamacare,” and reference a 2010 Chicago Tribune article about her role in Obamacare — though in reality the article discusses how she had not made a decision to sign the measure. Bean ultimately did support Obamacare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the part that dark money is doing here. When a voter sees that kind of bombardment, the shouting from the rooftops, that’s a direct impact,” Ahmed said. “And they’re able to by making ads on any topic that polls well — don’t even bring the word AI, don’t even bring the word AIPAC — just focus on what’s polling well and then bombard the voters, and then buy our races.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showalter, a former attorney for the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Justice Department counsel, said publicly funding elections — and ending Citizens United — would make a huge difference in deflating the power of special interests. He credited New York City's program, in which candidates receive public funding that partially matches what they raise, for helping Zohran Mamdani win the mayoral seat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"You have a matching program where you raise up to a million dollars and it's matched 8-to-1,\" Showalter said. \"That makes a big difference for people who are candidates who are running in a grassroots publicly supported way, so that you don't have to rely on the millions and millions of dollars that can, frankly, only be deployed by giant corporate interests.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

Singer-songwriter &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.bjrnck.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;BJRNCK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a part of this new era, embarking on her first headlining tour back home to Chicago at Schubas on Feb. 25, bringing to life her debut album, “A Girl Like Me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show will be a dramatic, immersive experience that brings fans into her decade-long journey. BJRNCK (pronounced byo͝or’nik), born Gennae Bewernick, aims to illustrate a relatable story of navigating womanhood and her journey as a singer. The hourlong performance will be narrated through music and skits that draw inspiration from her favorite film, the 1996 comedy-thriller “A Thin Line Between Love and Hate,” and the album itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I broke it down into sections. My album is like ‘Girl, I’ve been there too,’ but we’re learning. It’s like therapy albums. I want the show to feel like that.

A part of the local music scene since she was 16, she spent two years recording the album after signing with Geffen/Interscope Records. After years of releasing singles and collaborating with stars like Saba, HappyBirthdayCalvin, Chloe, Omarion and Babyface (who was nominated for a Grammy in 2024 for “Girls Night Out,” which featured an extended version bonus track with BJRNCK), she approached her breakout debut as a way to introduce herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m still a new artist to the world. How can I fit all the pieces of me that people have missed into this album, like who I am and what I’ve been through?” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The struggle of the beginning of her career is encapsulated in the album’s title track. The song samples an old video she recorded of herself documenting the grueling realities of being a singer on the come-up. Her mother sent her that video, and it inspired her to use it as the album’s intro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was in my basement in Chicago, sitting on my bed, I looked so sad. And I’m like, ‘it’s OK because one day, I’m going to be rich as f---, and I’m going to make a lot of money,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Los Angeles, where she is based now, BJRNCK and her family moved to the South Side when she was a 6-year-old girl. She grew up in the Altgeld Gardens housing projects and later moved to 81st Street and King Drive in Chatham. She attended Roseland Middle School with fellow singer Ravyn Lenae and rapper Adamn Killa, long before he was rapping, in fifth grade. She and Lenae would share a kinship, claiming each other as sisters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recalls Lenae sharing videos of her singing and being reluctant to upload them on YouTube. BJRNCK would encourage Lenae to post them anyway, believing in her singing talent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/music/2025/07/30/ravyn-lenae-chicago-high-school-arts-lollapalooza-sabrina-carpenter\"   &gt;Rising star Ravyn Lenae dropped by her former Chicago high school to offer this inspiring message&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m so proud of her. And it’s just inspiring because it’s like, I know my time is coming. We were all in the same area, we’re cut from the same cloth. Everybody gets their time. … Adamn wasn’t even doing music when we were in middle school, so even going viral and doing what he’s doing now is so fire,” she said of the rapper who went viral late last year for his &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/11/10/chicago-rapper-adamn-killa-tells-cops-to-arrest-me-daddy-getting-arrested-wont-stop-him\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“arrest me, daddy” videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of her predecessors, Tink, Dreezy, and icons like Jennifer Hudson and Shawnna, BJRNCK’s music epitomizes the fiery, bold, yet misunderstood spirit of authentic Black Chicago women — loving, honest, yet shaped into warriors by the harsh, patriarchal environments around them. For her, it's about showcasing that duality between softness and assertiveness, especially to the younger generation of girls who listen to her music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that it’s important for me, coming from the city and young girls listening to my music, to show, yeah, I’m aggressive, but there’s that sweet side too. It’s OK to be a girl and OK to be soft,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For BJRNCK, her homecoming show and the album are a victory lap after being behind the scenes. And with her forthcoming deluxe edition of “A Girl Like Me” arriving this summer, she is working harder than ever to blaze her own trail to superstardom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people think that I just got everything, I got all the resources, and it’s like, no, I’ve been grinding for 10 years trying to make it to this moment. But I wouldn’t have had it any other way,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;",

The two connected after Coria Jr.'s father was detained in early October near their Mount Prospect apartment complex in Krishnamoorthi's district. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's a story of a family that was going through tremendous hardship,\" Krishnamoorthi said. \"Donald Trump says he was going after the worst of the worst when he came into office, and I think Jaime's family represents really what has ended up being the target of Donald Trump's efforts — loving families who are trying to survive ... and now he's torn them apart.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coria Jr.'s father spent four days in \"inhumane\" conditions at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in west suburban Broadview before self-deporting to Mexico where he is currently working full-time and living in his childhood home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was packed into a windowless room with about 60 men, denied showers, forced to sleep on the floor or standing up and witnessed multiple detainees hauled away on stretchers, according to Krishnamoorthi. He signed a voluntary departure form and was deported the next day though his attorney secured an emergency hearing that could have halted his removal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He decided to pretty much sign his rights away,\" Coria Jr. said. \"He wasn't made aware of his legal options at that point.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnamoorthi inspected the Broadview facility in December after previous attempts were denied and said the building was \"not designed in any way to house people.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"What it shows is that if there's not oversight, bad things happen. And bad things were happening in Broadview ... so that's all the more reason for people like me to do oversight duties,\" Krishnamoorthi said. \"I'm going to stand up to them eight days a week because of what happened.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnamoorthi emphasized that Coria Jr.'s story highlights a broader pattern of detainees being \"put in inhumane conditions, coerced into signing away their rights and denied due process.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than a month after Coria Jr.'s father self-deported, a court &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/12/federal-judge-orders-release-hundreds-feds-deportation-midway-blitz-warrantless-arrests\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;ordered 615 detainees&lt;/a&gt; released in an attempt to \"restore the status quo that existed before the Trump administration recently changed its interpretation of immigration law.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coria Jr.'s father was recently denied an immigration visa during an appointment at the Consulate of Mexico, and the family's attorney is currently working on a response to that denial, Coria Jr. said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also noted his father \"breaks the Trump administration’s agenda\" about immigrants. He paid taxes every year for roughly two decades, never owed money to the IRS, never voted in an election and never has taken government benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coria Jr.'s father has been a roofer for three decades and played a pivotal role in helping take care of his wife of 10 years as she battled cholangiocarcinoma, a rare kind of liver cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The college junior's father took her to the emergency room on multiple occasions and waited until she was stabilized before working his labor-intensive job and returning to the hospital, staying overnight to make sure she was OK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"My mom's oncologist even wrote a letter talking about my dad's moral character,\" Coria Jr. said. \"He never got angry with me or my siblings [and] he always gave us advice.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coria Jr. urges others who had loved ones detained under harsh conditions at Broadview to speak out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The way we treat people is not something that should be up for debate,\" Coria Jr. said. \"We as a country should expect better for the treatment of immigrants in general.\" &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The remaining $130 million would be used for replacement of stadium seats, an upgrade of Soldier Field’s concessions, restrooms, locker rooms, video and sound systems, and an overhaul of luxury skyboxes and club level lounges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new revamp would also include structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing and exterior improvements, even as Chicago taxpayers remain saddled with $467 million in outstanding debt linked to the 2001 renovation of Soldier Field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wish list of improvements was devised by Legends Global, a company that manages nearly a dozen NFL stadiums and is now leading the  development of Alicante Park, a new sports and entertainment complex being built outside the Valencia, Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overhaul would include fencing and façade work, as well as unspecified improvements to the parking lots surrounding Soldier Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transportation improvements are the same as those floated by Mayor Brandon Johnson when he teamed up with Bears President Kevin Warren on a plan to build a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2024/04/23/bears-new-stadium-dome-lakefront-soldier-field\"   &gt;domed lakefront stadium&lt;/a&gt;

The Bears are trying to work out  an agreement with the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears-stadium/2025/06/01/bears-stadium-bill-springfield\"   &gt;Illinois General Assembly &lt;/a&gt;on a so-called “mega-projects” bill that would save the team hundreds of millions of dollars by freezing property taxes and allowing the team to negotiate reduced “payments in lieu of property taxes” with suburban school districts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would also include up to $700 million in road, sewer and utility work needed to pave the way for construction of a domed stadium on the Arlington Heights site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Park District’s 11th hour play for a piece of stadium funding throws a potential monkey wrench into Bears stadium negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears stadium bill can’t pass without substantial support from the General Assembly's Chicago lawmakers. If Chicago legislators demand a Soldier Field refresh in exchange for their votes, the heat would be on to find the money to appease Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘We want them to stay’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Park District Superintendent Carlos Ramirez-Rosa said the $500 million needed to ease the notorious transportation bottleneck around Soldier Field could come from the “motor fuel tax lock box money,” the state’s road fund that has $3.5 billion that “needs to be spent down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $130 million for a Soldier Field revamp could come, in part, from the penalty the Bears would pay if they terminate their lease, or if the Park District pursues the more aggressive legal theory that the Bears owe a 150% of the annual rent penalty from the moment they started looking for a new stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe the Bears belong here. We want them to stay in Chicago, but if that ship is sailed or sailing, then we’re prepared to plan for the future of Soldier Field to maintain it as a viable asset for large concerts, for large international and national sporting events that drives the local tourism economy, that puts heads in beds downtown and generates revenue for the city of Chicago, for the Park District,” Ramirez-Rosa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e10000\" name=\"image-e10000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab2a0c3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1078+0+1/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7f%2Ffd%2Fa163ff2544cca35ed98baf736df3%2Fbears-stadium-rendering-01.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b7378f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1078+0+1/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7f%2Ffd%2Fa163ff2544cca35ed98baf736df3%2Fbears-stadium-rendering-01.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/36db76a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1078+0+1/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7f%2Ffd%2Fa163ff2544cca35ed98baf736df3%2Fbears-stadium-rendering-01.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Renderings of the proposed Chicago Bears stadium in Arlington Heights.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/36db76a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1078+0+1/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7f%2Ffd%2Fa163ff2544cca35ed98baf736df3%2Fbears-stadium-rendering-01.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d53d273/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1078+0+1/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7f%2Ffd%2Fa163ff2544cca35ed98baf736df3%2Fbears-stadium-rendering-01.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/36db76a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1078+0+1/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7f%2Ffd%2Fa163ff2544cca35ed98baf736df3%2Fbears-stadium-rendering-01.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renderings of the proposed Chicago Bears stadium in Arlington Heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provided by Manica Architecture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez-Rosa stressed that Soldier Field is “in great shape,”  and remains the “largest non-tax revenue source” for the Chicago Park District — with $62.9 million in projected gross revenue that reduces pressure to raise property taxes and supports Park District programs citywide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year alone, Soldier Field played host to thirteen concert nights, including five straight over Labor Day weekend. Beyonce concerts in May 2025 generated $85 million in hotel revenue and 98.5% occupancy in downtown hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those numbers are all the more reason to “continue to invest” in Chicago’s lakefront stadium, in part by making it “easier to get in and out” of Soldier Field, Ramirez-Rosa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The plan that the Bears unveiled with the mayor would have fixed a lot of those issues,\" Ramirez-Rosa said. \"It was a great plan that would have benefited the South Loop. It would have benefited the museum campus. It would have made it easier for people to get in and out of the museum campus and Soldier Field. Those issues don’t go away if the Bears go to Arlington Heights or Indiana.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior mayoral adviser Jason Lee said the Johnson administration’s “number one focus is trying to make sure that Chicago remains in the mix to keep the Bears.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The partnership between the Park District and the Bears has been good for a number of reasons. We’d like to maintain it through some mechanism, and that’s what they’re having conversations in Springfield about,” Lee said. “This [Soldier Field Hail Mary] is just about saying, `We’re not going to lay down and die if it goes the other way.’ But our focus is preserving what we have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Springfield waits for details&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources close to the Bears’ Springfield negotiations said talks were heading in a positive direction despite the frustration caused by the team’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears-stadium/2026/02/19/chicago-bears-stadium-hammond-indiana-move\"   &gt;Hammond announcement &lt;/a&gt;last week. A committee hearing was set for Thursday on the bill the Bears are seeking that would allow them negotiate payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT) to local taxing bodies, resulting in lower property tax liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But getting close to a deal behind closed doors is a long way away from locking up 60 votes in the Illinois House and 30 in the Senate, where Chicago Democrats across the Capitol remain loath to pave the Bears’ way out of town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some city legislators are still holding out hope the Bears will reconsider the old Michael Reese Hospital site that the team has dismissed as too narrow, but most acknowledge it’s down to Arlington Heights or Indiana. One legislator noted that  Johnson has been “a complete nonentity” in stadium negotiations since the mayor’s ill-fated boosterism of the Bears proposal for a lakefront stadium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gov. JB Pritzker’s office wasn’t briefed on the park district funding plan. While he was optimistic about talks, Pritzker acknowledged “I really don't know whether they will choose to move out of the state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We continue to have really positive discussions with the Chicago Bears, and I think you're going to see progress over time here,\" Pritzker said Tuesday. \"I'm a Chicago Bears fan, believe very much that they ought to be based in Illinois, and I'm going to do everything I can without harming the taxpayers of the state of Illinois in the process of making sure that we can do everything we can to keep them in the state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Sen. Bill Cunningham, a South Side Democrat and a key negotiator in Bears talks, said he had not heard from park district officials about the funding proposal and was “unaware of anyone who has.” Spokespeople for House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch and Senate President Don Harmon said they also hadn’t reviewed the ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Sen. Robert Peters, whose district includes Soldier Field, said that without being briefed on the potential upgrades, he’d be on board with doing “whatever we need to do to make sure it remains one of the best concert venues in the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a top-tier stadium for the likes of Beyonce and Taylor Swift. If you can fill it for eight to 10 more concerts, that’ll easily make up for the potential loss of Bears revenue,” Peters said. “There’s a fallacy that sports stadiums are this huge economic driver. The Bears are not that great of a driver of revenue for Soldier Field. They make a massive blackout period and take all the revenue from it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Peters isn’t completely resigned to the Bears leaving the city, “we do have to have a conversation about what happens when the Bears convince someone to give them a handout,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Indiana is willing to tax working-class people to pay for billionaires’ new stadium, and the [Arlington Heights] PILOT bill seems like it’s moving, so we're now at a point where we have to think realistically about options on what is next,” Peters said. “Infrastructure support is understandable, but I personally am never going to support tax giveaways to build a new stadium.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoosier lawmakers are poised to pass legislation this week creating a new stadium finance authority and a slew of new taxes to pump upwards of $1 billion into a new stadium, along with $2 billion from the Bears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the legislation that passed the Indiana House on Tuesday, the Bears would be able to buy it for a buck once 40-year bonds are paid off, backed by taxes on admissions, hotel stays, and food and beverage costs within a stadium district. In the meantime, the Bears would sign a 35-year lease that would allow the team to retain all revenues generated by the stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Pero mientras Pizer y su grupo esperaban ansiosos, se hizo la calma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lo que temíamos, los sucesos de terror que preocupaban durante la noche, ninguno de eso sucedió”, comentó Pizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pizer dedujo que el objetivo de la violencia era comunicarle al gobierno que el cártel podría tomar un cierto nivel de control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creemos que realmente se trataba de enviar un mensaje al gobierno de que podían encender y apagar la violencia a su antojo”, contó Pizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agregó, “Si hubieran querido matar personas, nosotros estaríamos entre los primeros”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pizer expresó su preocupación sobre lo que las noticias harán por la reputación de la zona, ya que gran parte de Puerto Vallarta depende del turismo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Realmente queremos que las cosas vuelvan a ser el maravilloso lugar que tantas personas saben que es”, comentó Pizer. “Realmente merece nuestro apoyo y, francamente, de aquí en adelante, nuestra lealtad”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Planes de boda interrumpidos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En preparación para su boda en Guadalajara el viernes, Kaitlin Bucaro y Robbie Morris estaban sentados en una cafetería de Chicago escribiendo sus votos matrimoniales la mañana del domingo cuando recibieron noticias de una invitada que había viajado a México y que su vuelo había sido desviado y no podía aterrizar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La pareja leyó y vio las noticias provenientes de Guadalajara y en pocas horas supieron que tendrían que cancelar la boda de 150 invitados en la que habían pasado un año —y miles de dólares— planeando. Tenían previsto volar a México el martes por la mañana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Esta situación que está pasando no está necesariamente en estos contratos con estos proveedores”, dijo Bucaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creo que rápidamente nos dimos cuenta de que lo que estaba ocurriendo allí era más grande que esta boda y traer a un montón de gente”, comentó. “Necesitábamos cuidar la seguridad de todos, incluida nuestra propia seguridad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La pareja está “destrozada”, añadió Morris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Han hecho amigos en Guadalajara durante varios viajes allí en los últimos años. La mañana del lunes, se comunicaron con su amigo Chuy, que vive allí después de 30 años en Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nos rompe el corazón ver a todos pasar por esta situación caótica y violenta”, dijo Morris. “Y estamos pensando en todos allá”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bucaro y Morris están tratando de encontrar un nuevo lugar en el área de Chicago para seguir adelante con su boda este viernes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Con información de Associated Press\n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

What should have been a routine celebration of athletic excellence instead became a revealing cultural moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After extending the invitation, the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/feb/23/trump-usa-hockey-call-state-of-union\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;president joked&lt;/a&gt;, “I must tell you, we’re going to have to bring the women’s team,” adding that he would “probably be impeached” if they were not invited. Laughter followed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the U.S. men’s and women’s teams had delivered extraordinary victories against a fierce rival. Both performances electrified fans and showcased the highest level of international competition. Yet the reactions surrounding those wins exposed something familiar: Women’s achievements are still too often treated as secondary, inconvenient or worthy of acknowledgment only as an obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-b80000\" name=\"module-b80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Commentary bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commentary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are those defending the remark as harmless: just a joke, just locker room talk, boys will be boys. Throughout my career, I have heard similar dismissals: It’s just a toy, just a book, just a show. But words matter. And over time, they accumulate, shaping expectations about who belongs and whose accomplishments are taken seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When authority figures frame inclusion as optional or burdensome, the message travels quickly. Laughter signals what feels acceptable. Silence signals what feels risky to question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team environments depend on unity and belonging. Speaking up can feel like breaking ranks, while remaining quiet feels safer. Yet silence, even when unintended, communicates acceptance. Over time, these moments reinforce who is perceived as central and who remains an addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contrast is especially striking given the broader reality of these Olympics. Of the United States’ 12 gold medals, eight were won by women. Of the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2026/02/american-women-dominated-the-2026-olympics.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;33 total U.S. medals&lt;/a&gt;, women earned 21. Their performances are not supplementary to American achievement; they are foundational to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disparities in recognition do more than diminish women’s accomplishments. They alter the meaning of celebration itself. The men earned their victory unequivocally, yet the surrounding controversy risks attaching an unnecessary shadow to what should have been uncomplicated national pride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. women’s hockey team ultimately declined the White House invitation, a decision reflecting principle as much as disappointment. Recognition offered alongside dismissal rarely feels like recognition at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will men’s team stand up for women? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens next matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most meaningful response from the men’s team would require solidarity: a public acknowledgment that women athletes deserve equal respect, that jokes minimizing their inclusion are harmful and that teammates across gender lines stand together. Such a response would not diminish their victory; it would elevate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such actions do not come without risk. Speaking publicly in opposition, especially to a sitting president, invites swift backlash. Athletes who step into controversy often face immediate and personal criticism. The pressure to remain silent is real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet moments like this offer athletes a rare opportunity to shape something larger than a championship legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If members of the men’s team were to address what happened, offering clarification and support for the women’s team, it would mark a defining act of leadership. Greatness in sports is not measured only by performance under pressure, but by courage when silence feels easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And people are watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only young girls, but young boys and children everywhere are learning what respect looks like in real time. They are learning whether success excuses dismissal or whether excellence includes standing up for others. They are learning how men treat women when recognition and power are on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years from now, few will remember the precise wording of a joke. But they will remember athletes choosing respect over comfort and unity over silence. They will remember players who understood that how victories are carried matters as much as how they are won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sports has never existed apart from culture. From Title IX to ongoing fights for equal pay and investment, athletics has long helped shape national conversations about fairness and belonging. Moments like this become lessons far beyond the rink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When women win and are treated as an afterthought, the message reaches classrooms, workplaces and communities alike: You may help carry the nation, but you will not be centered in its story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inclusion without respect is not equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victories over Canada should have been remembered solely for athletic brilliance: four teams competing, two American triumphs, one shared sense of pride. Instead, they revealed how persistent the work of equality remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The men’s team now faces an opportunity few champions receive: to ensure their victory stands not only for competitive excellence, but for integrity. A moment of solidarity could transform controversy into progress and ensure this championship is remembered not only for winning, but for leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question raised here extends beyond hockey. When women win for America, will America stand fully with them, or will equality remain an invitation extended only as an afterthought?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer, this time, may belong to the champions themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jodi Bondi Norgaard is an entrepreneur, author and gender-equity advocate.

You see them on security camera footage, jiggling locked door handles. They notice the doggie door., remove a cat from the car, push it through the door, then speed off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a cat, however, the animal didn't stay where it was put. She ran back outside, into the freezing weather, joined by two more cats dropped off by the same couple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-7a0000\" name=\"module-7a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Opinion bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volunteers who keep Fat Cat humming eventually corralled the three cats, one badly hurt by frostbite. Then they appealed to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We need your help please,\" Michelle Andrich, a volunteer wrote. \"Two-part help.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first part was to share photos of the couple dropping off the cats and their car in the hope that \"someone will recognize them and turn them in... There should be consequences for their actions.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pass. In the annals of unpunished crime, dropping off cats at a shelter doesn't cry out for justice The couple didn't know any better, which leads to Fat Cat's second request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There are proper ways for a pet owner to surrender their pets,\" said Andrich. Would I help \"educate or enlighten people on proper ways to surrender your pet\"?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I can &lt;i&gt;try&lt;/i&gt;.Whether they actually get enlightened is on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People give up their animals for a variety of reasons — they move,  lose jobs, can no longer afford their upkeep. Pets get sick, or their owners do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What should you do if you can no longer care for an animal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start by planning ahead, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Don't wait until the last minute,\" said Kaye Larsen Olloway, who runs Fat Cat and suggests giving at least a month to find your pet a home. \"If you know you're moving out, don't wait until the night before to make arrangements for the pet. Give us a chance to make arrangements . We have a list of 20 other rescues we can contact.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or reach out to Chicago Animal Care and Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Our staff will help you,\" said Armando Tejeda, public information officer at CACC. \"You don't have to do this alone. Resources exist.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/07/25/pet-owner-surrender-dogs-cats-overwhelming-shelters-rescues\"   &gt;Pet owner surrender rates are up, overwhelming Chicago shelters&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tejeda said CACC will work with pet owners to help them keep their animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If you just need food for a week or two, we can help you with that,\" said Tejeda. \"Or minor surgery. The landlord won't allow unfixed animals, and you can't afford to neuter, we'll do the neutering, or bring your pet up to date on vaccines.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business is booming at CACC — 5,753 pet surrenders last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Last year our adoptions are the highest in our history,\" said Tejeda. \"We're averaging 56 animals a day coming into the shelter.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the big jump?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Housing instability is a big one right now,\" said Tejeda. \"Landlords are telling tenants they can't have pets, or are imposing monthly fees — $25 to $50 a month or more. The rising cost of veterinary care is also a huge factor.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pet owners have a far better chance of finding a home for an animal than CACC does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"You're the best advocate for your pet,\" said Tejeda, pointing out that dogs get lost in the crowd at the shelter. \"They shut down and are hard to show. All these dogs don't get out of the cage much. They're jumping up, barking.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, CACC is a kill shelter — animals are put down, sometimes on the day they arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We should be a last resort,\" said Tejeda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although — and I'm pointing this out because people might not think of it — another reason pets are abandoned is because they're dying, and the CACC way is quicker and more merciful than freezing to death on the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We do offer low cost euthanasia, if someone knows it's time,\" he said. \"A $10 charge.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since people will ask, I'm happy to report the three cats abandoned in January at Fat Cat are doing well. They have names (the one with the worst frostbite is Elsa, for obvious reasons). They were lucky. You can help your pets be lucky too, if you remember the love you felt when you first got them should it become necessary to part ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Dumping them is wrong whether you dump them at a rescue or dump them on the side of the road,\" wrote Andrich. \"It’s just wrong. They are not garbage. The animals deserve better. If you can’t take care of them, then make an effort to find a place that can take them. Do the right thing.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

Grand Ave., the former home of Rock Bottom Brewery that was a favorite among tourists and beer fans before it closed suddenly in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chicago location is the ninth F1 Arcade, with the first one opening in London in 2022. The first U.S. location opened in Boston in 2024. Other U.S. locations have recently opened in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Denver, Las Vegas and Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.K.-based F1 Arcade, whose U.S. operations is based in Chicago, holds an exclusive Formula One license. Adam Breeden, co-founder of several entertainment venues such as Puttshack and Flight Club, founded F1 Arcade in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago's location will be the first to have a rooftop terrace, as well as Chicago-inspired specialty cocktails and a dining menu, according to the company. There will be 70 full-motion racing simulators with multiple game modes, allowing guests to race individually or in teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visitors will also be able to attend official Formula One watch parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Chicago is a city that thrives on energy, competition and unforgettable experiences, which makes it a natural home for F1 Arcade,” Jon Gardner, president of global development at F1 Arcade, said in a news release. \"With our U.S. headquarters based here, bringing F1 Arcade to River North feels especially meaningful. … This venue is designed specifically for the city and its culture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;F1 Arcade plans to open 30 locations globally in the next five years, according to a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-660000\" name=\"image-660000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de93527/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+190/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6c%2F09%2Fef7e36d64845b966e8f9841be6bc%2Ff1-arcade-atlanta-00470.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8efc2d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+190/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6c%2F09%2Fef7e36d64845b966e8f9841be6bc%2Ff1-arcade-atlanta-00470.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/57efcac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+190/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6c%2F09%2Fef7e36d64845b966e8f9841be6bc%2Ff1-arcade-atlanta-00470.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Inside the Atlanta location of F1 Arcade, with high-top seating in the center and racing simulators against the wall \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/57efcac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+190/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6c%2F09%2Fef7e36d64845b966e8f9841be6bc%2Ff1-arcade-atlanta-00470.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5662716/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+190/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6c%2F09%2Fef7e36d64845b966e8f9841be6bc%2Ff1-arcade-atlanta-00470.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/57efcac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3840x2155+0+190/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6c%2F09%2Fef7e36d64845b966e8f9841be6bc%2Ff1-arcade-atlanta-00470.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the Atlanta location of F1 Arcade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provided by F1 Arcade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

It will mark Bid’s first time performing the album in its entirety alongside a full orchestra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the CSO, “the program balances swelling sounds with jazz, folk, and pop melodies.” Following a performance of the full album with orchestra arrangements, Bird, a Lake Forest native, will also play other fan favorites from his decades-long career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the late ’90s, Bird has released 18 albums and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Folk Album for his 2019 release, “My Finest Work Yet.” In Chicago, his holiday season Gezelligheid concerts have become a local tradition and an often hard-to-get ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is Bird’s debut with his hometown orchestra, he is no stranger to classical music halls. The violinist has performed shows in iconic venues like New York’s Carnegie Hall and Sydney Opera House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bird’s collaboration with the CSO comes after local rocker Billy Corgan, of Smashing Pumpkins, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/music/2025/11/18/billy-corgan-smashing-pumpkins-night-of-mellon-collie-infinite-sadness-lyric-opera\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;teamed up last fall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with Chicago’s Lyric Opera to celebrate the 30th anniversary of “A Night of Mellon Collie and Infinite Sadness.” Plus, the Chicago Philharmonic teamed up with &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/music/2024/08/01/laufey-lollapalooza-chicago-philharmonic-orchestra-performances\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;pop-jazz superstar Laufey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 for what was billed as the first orchestral performance at Lollapalooza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tickets for Bird’s appearances at CSO will go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. on Friday, March 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Courtney Kueppers is an arts and culture reporter at WBEZ.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Pat Dowell, Fire owner and chairman Joe Mansueto and team president Dave Baldwin. Current coach and director of football Gregg Berhalter will be in attendance, as will Fire alumni and other guests.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The groundbreaking comes more than two years before the stadium will see Fire matches. The team expects the facility to be ready in time for the beginning of the 2028-29 season, the second season in which MLS will play from late summer to spring instead of using the spring to fall format it had followed since its inception.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;That shift signals a giant change for MLS, and the new stadium represents another transformation for the Fire under Mansueto.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Mansueto, who is bankrolling the 22,000-seat stadium, moved the Fire from SeatGeek Stadium in Bridgeview back to Soldier Field for the 2020 season. The Fire also officially opened a new performance center last year, and in 2025 made the playoffs for the first time since 2017 while showing a willingness to spend on top players and staff.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The stadium issue, however, is one that has plagued the club for much of its existence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The Fire were displaced during the Soldier Field renovations and spent all of 2002 and most of 2003 in Naperville, playing at a temporarily expanded small college football stadium. In 2006, the team went to the soccer-specific stadium in Bridgeview, where the team declined on the field and that coincided with the struggles to draw urban fans to the southwest suburb.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In 2019, Mansueto and the Fire paid $65.5 million to alter their lease with Bridgeview and return to Soldier Field immediately. But as soon as that move was confirmed, speculation began about whether the Bears’ home would be the Fire’s actual long-term dwelling or just a stopover.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;On Tuesday, the Fire will take another step toward building that permanent residence.&lt;/p&gt;",

Lynn Moore Jr. bemoaned what he called the “scapegoating” of the company, which has been working for years to upgrade the county’s property tax system. Moore alleged that the treasurer has shown a “lack of accountability” for mistakes by her own office in her efforts to “deflect blame and divert attention to us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus of much of the letter, though, was on Pappas’ behavior toward Tyler team members, who Moore said had faced “attacks” from the treasurer in the past year. Moore said the situation finally prompted him to conclude that Tyler executives would stop taking calls from Pappas and would not meet with her in-person again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore said Tyler had reported on their interactions with Pappas to other county officials, including an aide to county Board President Toni Preckwinkle, only to hear “other County leaders minimize your conduct as ‘that’s just Maria being Maria.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore told Pappas, “You have berated and bullied my earnest and hard-working team members without repercussions or reproach, and you have tried to sabotage this project, for the last time. Others at Cook County may have grown accustomed to your approach and consider this business as usual, but I most certainly do not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore sent copies of the 9-page letter to Preckwinkle’s office and to the county board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Pappas did not immediately respond to questions about the letter from WBEZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Preckwinkle said in a statement she took the accusations seriously and would forward the letter to internal watchdogs for the county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The alleged language and conduct directed at Tyler Technologies by the treasurer are troubling and unacceptable,” Preckwinkle said. “Public officials are expected to lead with integrity, demonstrate respect, and uphold the highest ethical standards, fostering public confidence in government.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preckinkle also said, “This matter will be formally referred to the Department of Ethics and Human Rights for a thorough review and any investigation deemed necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Moore also did not respond to requests for comment, but the company sent WBEZ a brief written statement: “We believe the letter fully and clearly communicates our position.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his letter to Pappas, Moore detailed what he said were a series of threats, insults and other verbal abuse by the treasurer directed at Tyler’s project manager in Cook County, another employee on the project and one of the company’s “most senior executives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, Moore wrote, Pappas told the unnamed project manager for Cook County that another Tyler executive was “the biggest f–k-up I’ve ever seen” and she “screamed” that she would “make sure he never gets another motherf—-g contract in the world ever again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore alleged that at a meeting last spring Pappas, in front of “multiple witnesses,” berated Tyler employee Mark Hawkins: “You stood over him, thrust your finger in his face, and unleashed a torrent of insults and threats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore wrote that Pappas more recently directed her “vitriol” at another Tyler executive, Abby Diaz. During a phone call around Christmas, Moore alleged, Pappas “insulted in colorful and sometimes racial language President Preckwinkle, the Bureau of Technology and its leaders, and the County Clerk.” Preckwinkle and Clerk Monica Gordon are Black. Pappas is Greek-American.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore also accused Pappas of calling Diaz a “token Hispanic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You characterized her perceived lack of pushback with local media as ‘a 13-year-old getting raped who just says thank you,’” Moore wrote to Pappas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore said Pappas called Diaz last week and told her: “You’re a f—-g idiot. Can you speak English? Learn to speak English. I’m going to ruin you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore told Pappas her “mistreatment” of Diaz “exceeds the bounds of human decency,” and had led him to take action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“County leadership has not been able to insulate Tyler team members from your mistreatment or misinformation,” Moore wrote. “They say they do not control you, and insinuate that this type of abuse is almost a rite of passage. I do not control you either, but I am taking steps to protect my team.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said any communication from Pappas would be forwarded to him and that only he and company lawyers would respond. Moore also said Tyler’s entire team on the Cook County project would be working from home this week “as I do not feel comfortable having them onsite in the days following your receipt of this letter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore also alleged that Pappas “claimed to have been ‘feeding’ information to President Preckwinkle’s primary opponent, Ald. Brendan Reilly (42nd), about the Tyler contract.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reilly is running to unseat Preckwinkle in the March 17 Democratic primary, and he has criticized the incumbent over the county’s problems with the computer upgrade project. Reilly has said he would consider &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/government-politics/elections/2026/02/16/cook-county-board-president-march-democratic-primary-toni-preckwinkle-brendan-reilly\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;terminating the county’s contract&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with Tyler, if elected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reilly spokesman Phil Swibinski said Tuesday everything Reilly has said about the topic has been drawn from media reports and the campaign’s own review of the Tyler contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s nothing that came from Maria Pappas whatsoever, ” Swibinski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the letter from Moore “was just an attempt to deflect blame from Toni Preckwinkle.

The Bears dug themselves out of futility. Great. But there’s so much more to chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don't confuse the postseason victory or exceeding expectations from outside of the building [as it’s] OK to be complacent,” coach Ben Johnson said Tuesday at the NFL Scouting Combine. “It's not. We didn't do enough. We’ve got to do more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they want to do better, they’ll have to be better. The same roster, even with projected improvement by quarterback Caleb Williams, theoretically would deliver the same outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means Johnson and general manager Ryan Poles must detach themselves from players they love, who just helped the Bears have their best season since 2018, and be ruthless in evaluating potential upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poles and Johnson face decisions on pending free agents like safeties Kevin Byard and Jaquan Brisker and outside free agents, as well as what to do with the No. 25 overall draft pick, but they also have several key players under contract for next season that are up for discussion because of affordable escapes in their contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That group includes linebacker Tremaine Edmunds, tight end Cole Kmet and running back D’Andre Swift. The Bears also could save salary-cap space by trading wide receiver DJ Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poles dodged a question about Edmunds’ future, left options open with Moore and said he felt “pretty good” about retaining Kmet and Swift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edmunds is coming off a good season with 112 tackles, four interceptions and a fumble recovery, but the Bears need to clear salary-cap space to address more pressing needs like left tackle and pass rush. They can pay Edmunds $17.4 million this season or cut him for $2.4 million. It’s sensible to reallocate that money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears are a negligible $4.1 million over the cap going into the new league year March 11 and can clear more than that by restructuring some contracts. But they’ll have to dig deeper to create enough space to acquire a high-end pass rusher like Maxx Crosby or Trey Hendrickson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as technology has sped up communication, there remains no substitute for in-person interaction. When the Combine pulls the league’s general managers and agents into close proximity for the week in Indianapolis, things start moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raiders general manager John Spytek, for example, was careful in his public comments Tuesday about planning to keep Crosby, but that conversation could be a lot different at a steakhouse. That’s why Poles stopped short of saying concretely the Bears will hang on to Kmet and Swift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel pretty good about [them] being here, but... any new, unique opportunities that might pop up are usually going to pop up here,” he said when asked specifically about those two. “We’ll get back and sort it all out and make decisions, but I feel pretty good about those guys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that the Bears just had a top-10 offense for the first time since 2013 and Kmet ($11.6 million) and Swift ($8.8 million) have reasonable cap numbers for their positions, they’re good fits. Swift just had a career year with 1,087 yards and nine touchdowns and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/16/bears-rb-dandre-swift-hopes-he-convinced-team-to-keep-him-heading-into-final-year-of-contract\"   &gt;told the Sun-Times recently he hopes that’s enough to convince the Bears he should stay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore is the trickiest puzzle. He was ultra-reliable his first two seasons with the Bears, putting up 2,330 yards and 14 touchdown catches despite the offense being a mess and the quarterbacks struggling, then slipped to career lows with 50 catches for 682 yards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poles and Johnson were adamant that Moore has been worth more than those statistics show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was a guy we could count on,” Johnson said. “The versatility is something that screams at you. The intelligence screams at you and... just the toughness, the durability. A player like that is really, really valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not the entirety of the debate. Having Moore is a positive for the Bears, but is he a legitimate No. 1 wide receiver on a team with championship aspirations? Will he play up to his $28.5 million cap hit, which is seventh among receivers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s difficult to answer. It’ll also be difficult for another team to answer if it’s considering making an offer. And then the Bears would face the challenge of replacing him within their budget. They’d be better off betting on Moore, still just 28, bouncing back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want him here,” Poles said. “We think highly of him. He’s a great teammate. He’s been productive consistently over the last couple years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have nothing but great things to say about him, but this is the time that you have to look at all the different scenarios and see what can allow us to put the best team out there. He’s a guy we want here, but we have to look at all different scenarios.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s painful, but it’s the right way to think. If the Bears aren’t content with what they did last season, they can’t be content with their roster. Some moves are more likely than others, but Poles should be willing to listen on almost anyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

It consists of silky tofu bathed in a fiery, aromatic sauce that balances heat, numbing spice and rich umami flavor. Mapo tofu roughly translates to “pockmarked grandma's tofu,” which is named for the elderly Chengdu woman who created the dish in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stew is traditionally made with soft tofu and ground beef or pork. A potent blend of hot chile oil, fermented broad bean paste (doubanjiang) and Sichuan peppercorns delivers heat and complexity to the fiery stew. Meanwhile, the peppercorns numb the tongue, which helps to temper the chile heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubanjiang is a classic sauce and a key ingredient in Chinese Sichuan cooking. The ingredients can be purchased at Asian markets, in well-stocked supermarkets and online.

Add the ground meat to the skillet and stir-fry until it begins to brown, 1 to 2 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the white scallion mixture and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the chicken stock mixture and bring to a simmer. Add the tofu and gently stir to coat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stir in the cornstarch mixture. Simmer until the sauce thickens, stirring constantly, about 1 minute. Add half of the green scallions and remove the skillet from the heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divide the stew between serving bowls. Serve garnished with the remaining green scallions and the reserved ground pepper.&lt;/p&gt;",

JB Pritzker said Tuesday at an event announcing the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Department of Natural Resources provided $21 million in funding, making the project the largest public-private partnership for the IDNR. The department issued a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2025/01/31/wanted-a-team-to-return-the-bloom-to-pullmans-historic-hotel-florence\"   &gt;Request for Solicitations last year&lt;/a&gt;, searching for a development team to revitalize the state-owned hotel at 11111 S. Forrestville Ave. and its 1914 annex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state has partnered with the Chicago-based development group Celadon Partners. Scott Henry, CEO of Celadon, said his family grew up and worked in Pullman, making this project personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pointed to several similarities in Chicago and the U.S. between 1881, when Hotel Florence opened, and now. Chicago was on the heels of a pandemic, American politics were “chaotic” (President James Garfield barely won his election in 1881 and was assassinated soon after) and Pullman factories had revolutionized the city’s economy and advanced the railway industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry sees similar advancements happening in the Far South Side with the development of the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/technology/2025/10/09/french-pasqal-us-headquarters-south-works-quantum-computing-park\"   &gt;Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park&lt;/a&gt;, about a 15 minute drive north of the Pullman National Historic Site. The neighborhood also has an Amazon distribution center and the Pullman Community Center, 10355 S. Woodlawn Ave. The CTA Red Line expansion project also plans to extend into Pullman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-8b0000\" name=\"image-8b0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/15729ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+625/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc3%2Fb8%2Fd31e253c4d3a81a7c6c8bacbc6d5%2Fflorence-260225-026a.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d1e42bb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+625/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc3%2Fb8%2Fd31e253c4d3a81a7c6c8bacbc6d5%2Fflorence-260225-026a.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2175b3a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+625/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc3%2Fb8%2Fd31e253c4d3a81a7c6c8bacbc6d5%2Fflorence-260225-026a.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The entryway of Hotel Florence\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2175b3a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+625/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc3%2Fb8%2Fd31e253c4d3a81a7c6c8bacbc6d5%2Fflorence-260225-026a.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/36df2d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+625/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc3%2Fb8%2Fd31e253c4d3a81a7c6c8bacbc6d5%2Fflorence-260225-026a.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2175b3a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+625/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc3%2Fb8%2Fd31e253c4d3a81a7c6c8bacbc6d5%2Fflorence-260225-026a.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entryway of Hotel Florence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Instead of our new guests coming here to buy Pullman cars, they’ll be treated to a mind-blowing entertainment experience in the former Pullman Factory,” Henry said. “I think of this area as becoming the beating heart of Pullman again. And if it’s going to be the beating heart of Pullman again, its soul certainly will be the Art of Culture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arts organization Art of Culture is partnering with the developer to help bring talent and artists to the site's future music venue. Art of Culture CEO Heather Smith said the artistic hub only becomes Pullman’s “beating heart” because of the people it will attract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Art of Culture will really tap into our community and tap into what we know exists here today, and that’s the artistic energy of the South Side that sometimes needs platform and needs spaces to be highlighted,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She imagines a space buzzing with energy and art exhibitions, in addition to live music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know it’s the vibration, the rhythm, the sounds that will come from Pullman, from this space that will be felt across the city,” Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture firm Farr Associates is designing the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a more intangible duty as architects, as designers, as historians to the translation of 150 years of cultural heritage and grassroots advocacy,” Mercedes Miley, president of Farr Associates and a Pullman resident, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miley also requested residents to share with them any artifacts or photographs from past events at Hotel Florence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a very well-documented site that as part of this project, we get to tell those stories again,” Miley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. It was saved from demolition when the Historic Pullman Foundation bought the hotel in 1975. The state purchased the building in 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hotel has been closed since 2000, with the exception of opening for occasional tours.&lt;/p&gt;",

Jesse Jackson in Washington, D.C., South Carolina and Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Secret Service has already conducted a security sweep in anticipation of presidents in attendance at the House of Hope on the South Side, where a \"People's Celebration\" will be held Friday, March 6. The event is likely to be the largest and most star-studded among a week's worth of events. The Secret Service will also secure locations in Washington, D.C., where the family is planning to hold services next week, in anticipation of potential presidential and foreign leader arrivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jackson family has invited Trump and former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Joe Biden and George W. Bush to events commemorating him. It's unclear which events the presidents will attend.       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family on Tuesday said they had not received any confirmations of presidential arrivals, but anticipated them after a full schedule is released about services in both South Carolina and Washington. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Events are being held in South Carolina, where Jackson was born, and in Washington, D.C., to allow people to mourn Jackson. Details on the South Carolina and Washington events are still being finalized but will happen between March 1 and 5.  House Speaker &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2026/02/20/house-speaker-mike-johnson-rev-jesse-jackson-family-request-lie-in-honor-us-capitol\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Mike Johnson last week declined a request&lt;/a&gt; by Jackson’s family to have him lie in repose  at the U.S. Capitol — but alternative Washington, D.C., locations were being discussed, including Howard University, the Washington National Cathedral or the National Museum of African American History.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson will lie in repose Thursday, Feb. 26, and Friday, Feb. 27, at Rainbow PUSH’s Kenwood headquarters at 930 E. 50th St. The services both days will start at 10 a.m. A “People’s Celebration” in Chicago will be held at 10 a.m. on Friday, March 6, at House of Hope at 752 E. 114th St. Doors open at 9 a.m. Private homegoing services are scheduled for 10 a.m. Saturday, March 7, at Rainbow PUSH. Doors open at 8 a.m., with limited capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump was among top political leaders to extend his sympathies after Jackson’s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew him well, long before becoming President,” Trump posted on his Truth Social account. “He was very gregarious — Someone who truly loved people! Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama wrote in a statement with former First Lady Michelle Obama that Jackson \"laid the foundation\" for his own presidential campaign \"to the highest office of the land.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Michelle and I will always be grateful for Jesse's lifetime of service, and the friendship our families share,\" the Obamas said. \"We stood on his shoulders.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relatives of Jackson said that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/17/what-we-know-rev-jesse-jacksons-death-services\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“all are welcome,”&lt;/a&gt; regardless of political party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson died at age 84 Feb. 17.  He had been in declining health for a decade. In 2017 he announced he had been &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2017/11/17/18375473/rev-jesse-jackson-announces-parkinson-s-diagnosis\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; two years earlier, but last April he revealed that it was actually misdiagnosed progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare neurological disorder. He stepped down as president of PUSH in July 2023, citing health concerns. Jackson appeared onstage at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 2024, when he was presented to the crowd after a video celebrating his life, but he did not speak.&lt;/p&gt;",

Government officials also said multiple airlines had resumed operations at the Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta airports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five flights to Chicago were among 100 canceled from Puerto Vallarta on Sunday and Monday after videos posted to social media showed chaos at the airports, according to the tracking website FlightAware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A United Airlines flight from Puerto Vallarta left Monday afternoon and landed in Chicago in the evening. An airline spokesperson said full operations resumed at that airport and in Guadalajara on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Airlines said it planned to resume its operations at both airports Tuesday with four extra flights between Puerto Vallarta and the United States with 750 additional seats. One American flight was scheduled direct to Chicago on Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both United and American travelers would be allowed to change their flights without charge to get back into the United States, the airlines said. AeroMéxico, VivaAeorbus and Volaris flights in and out of Guadalajara, including flights to the United States, were also operating normally Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department still advised Americans to seek shelter and minimize unnecessary movements, as well as to confirm that flights are on track for departure before heading to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;",
