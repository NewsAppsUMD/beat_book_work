Sandburg took full advantage of its opportunity on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/10/chicago-illinois-high-school-basketball-scores\"   &gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in Orland Park, upsetting &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/super-25-basketball-rankings/2026/02/08/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;No. 21 Lockport&lt;/a&gt; 55-52.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"That was most definitely fun,\" Eagles senior Jonah Johnson said. \"But that is how we are supposed to play every game. We need to come out with that same energy and keep it rolling.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson, a 6-2 guard, finished with 10 points and six rebounds. Will, his identical twin brother, led Sandburg with 13 points and six rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonah Johnson's post basket with 3:13 left put Sandburg (19-10, 9-6 SouthWest Suburban) ahead 51-45. Junior Daniel Morakinyo shot 4-for-6 from the free throw line in the final minute to see the win home for the Eagles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Johnson twins' father, Will, played at Western Michigan. The twins have already secured Sandburg's first winning season since 2018, and the overall goal is to win the school's first regional since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We lost games we shouldn't have at the start of the season,\" Jonah Johnson said. \"But his shows we can really compete against the better teams in our sectional.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a balanced offensive effort for Sandburg. Liiban Debala scored nine points and Malachi Perkis and Will Hooks each added five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockport has a pair of talented twins of its own in juniors Nojus and Nedas Venckus. They combined for 44 points, but the Porters' offense never seemed to find a rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We have [assistant coach Bob Curran] to thank for that,\" Jonah Johnson said. \"He's such a great coach and he's been working with us on our new defense. It really messed [Lockport] up and got them off their game.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d80000\" name=\"image-d80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f5aadf2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c5fd6f9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f27d249/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Sandburg&amp;#x27;s Will Johnson (3) takes the ball to the rim against Lockport.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f27d249/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2dc57e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f27d249/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandburg’s Will Johnson (3) takes the ball to the rim against Lockport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nojus Venckus made a three in the final seconds to tighten up the score.

His defensive system is good and the boys work really hard at it. We frustrated them.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandburg has won five consecutive games and beat Lincoln-Way Central and Lyons this season. But this is the first major win for the Eagles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"A lot of people saw us as a 6, 7 or 8-seed,\" Daniels said. \"This win changes that. We beat Lincoln-Way Central and Lockport head-to-head. We have to be considered for a 3 or 4-seed.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockport (22-5, 11-3) jumped into the Super 25 two weeks ago after knocking off Homewood-Flossmoor. The Porters have also lost to H-F twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockport and Sandburg are in the Class 4A Joliet West sectional. H-F and Marist seem locked in as the top two seeds, but it is totally up for grabs after that with the host Tigers, Brother Rice, Lincoln-Way Central, Thornwood and now Sandburg all in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-b40000\" name=\"html-embed-module-b40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"No Shot Clock, Ep. 201: Conference quick takes\" allowtransparency=\"true\" height=\"150\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);height:150px;\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=5patj-1a40c88-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=auto&amp;logo_link=episode_page&amp;btn-skin=c73a3a\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

She honked her horn, yelled “la migra” and tried to warn people about the agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she pulled her Rogue beside the Tahoe near 39th and Kedzie, where she said Exum swerved toward her Rogue and their vehicles swiped each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez said she stopped her Rogue but feared being “manhandled” by the agents, so she drove away. She said she drove to her “farthest left,” to avoid the agents climbing out of their vehicle on her right. But as she passed, she said Exum opened fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She pulled over at a repair shop, was taken to a hospital and eventually into federal custody. Authorities then alleged that Martinez and another man “rammed” Exum’s car.&lt;/p&gt;",

Des Moines is about 330 miles west of Chicago, while the Quad Cities are about 170 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears own 326 acres in Arlington Heights, which the team has declared to be the only suitable site in Cook County. Late last year, though, the Bears began discussing building across state lines in Indiana. Last month, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell joined Bears chairman George McCaskey and president/CEO Kevin Warren on tours of Arlington Heights and two Indiana sites — near Wolf Lake in Hammond and the Hard Rock Casino in Gary. The city of Portage will throw its hat into the ring Wednesday, albeit as a long shot, when it holds a press conference touting “Halas Harbor\" along the Burns Waterway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren was hired more than three years ago to seal a stadium deal, but the team’s search drags on. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said this week that talks to keep the Bears in Illinois were progressing even as Indiana continued its flirtation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-bc0001\" name=\"list-bc0001\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, inverseColors=false, pagination=[{body=[Next Page], href=?p=2, _template=/link/Link.hbs, contentId=null, pianoSectionSlug=null, target=null}], footerBgColor=#000000, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, pullQuoteIcon=[{image=null, narrowImage=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=null}], headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, items=[{type=Image, media=[{ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/19/3c/f5982442454f9f002a0e68aff183/ap26040063399644.jpg, width=3539, height=2360}, alt=Bad Bunny performs during halftime of Super Bowl LX between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, in Santa Clara, California. , narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/19/3c/f5982442454f9f002a0e68aff183/ap26040063399644.jpg, width=3539, height=2360}}], publishDate=February 10, 2026 07:23 PM, wordCount=640, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, timestamp=1770772980000, isFeatured=false, anchorId=promo-170000, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/associated-press, bio=[{items=[The Associated Press is an independent, not-for-profit news cooperative headquartered in New York City.

That would make it the fourth-most watched halftime behind Kendrick Lamar (133.5 million, 2025), Michael Jackson (133.4 million, 1993) and Usher (129.3 million, 2024).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Peak audience sets U.S. record&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audience for the game peaked at 137.8 million viewers during the second quarter (6:45-7 p.m. Chicago time), which is a record. That surpassed the previous mark of 137.7 million during the second quarter of last year's Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's audience ended a streak where the last four Super Bowls had experienced audience increases. It is the fifth straight year the game has averaged over 100 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three straight years of Super Bowls that came down to the final minute, the last two have lacked excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday's game was the second in Super Bowl history in which a touchdown had not been scored in the first three quarters. Seattle was up 12-0 going into the final 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's game was decided in the first half as Philadelphia built a 24-0 lead en route to a 40-22 victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bad Bunny vs. Kid Rock&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Turning Point USA halftime show featuring Kid Rock peaked at 5 million at one point on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nielsen did not measure any of the YouTube livestream viewership. Of the linear networks that carried it, the only one Nielsen measures is broadcast network Charge! Full Nielsen ratings for the prior week will be released on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to YouTube figures though, there have been 21,208,583 views of the alternate halftime show through Tuesday night, according to the conservative organization's page. Bad Bunny's show has already had 61,311,972 views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Halftime show on social media&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total social media consumption of Bad Bunny's halftime show set a record of 4 billion views after the first 24 hours, according to the NFL and Ripple Analytics. That is a 137% increase over last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social media figures include fans, owned platforms, broadcast partners and influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFL said over 55% of all social views came from international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full global viewership for the halftime show is expected to be available early next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Spanish audience record&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telemundo averaged 3.3 million viewers, making it the most-watched Super Bowl Spanish-language broadcast in the United States. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the U.S. since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audience peaked during the halftime show, averaging 4.8 million viewers — also making it the most-watched Super Bowl halftime in Spanish-language history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Olympics benefit from Super Bowl&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBC's \"Primetime in Milan\" Olympic show, which featured the women's downhill and team figure skating events, averaged 42 million viewers, the network's largest Winter Olympics audience since Day 2 of the 2014 Sochi Games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also was a 73% increase from the Olympics show after Super Bowl 56 (24.3 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The Super Bowl and the NFL once again delivered a blockbuster audience across the NBC broadcast network, Peacock and Telemundo, and provided an unprecedented lead-in to our Primetime in Milan coverage,\" NBC Sports President Rick Cordella said in a statement. \"The Super Bowl and the Olympics are the two most powerful events in the world, and we salute our talented production, tech and announce teams who delivered best-in-class presentations for our viewers, stations and partners.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Other NFL figures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFL playoffs averaged 37 million viewers the first three weekends, up 5% from last year and the second-most watched in the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That followed a regular season that averaged 18.7 million, the second-highest since audience averages began being kept in 1988. It was a 10% increase from last season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Williams’ son told her that his teacher had him play the role of “dictator” during the lesson and instructed him to pull a classmate out of their chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams’ son also told her that other students were asked to use tape — meant to symbolize chains — to bind a classmate’s hands. According to Williams’ son, the teacher said the students with their hands bound would be shipped off in a cage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the role-playing, according to Williams’ son, the teacher put on an educational video about slavery. The teacher, who is white, then told her son that if he felt uncomfortable watching it, he could step out of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Public Schools officials said in a statement that they do not support simulations or reenactments of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the incident points to long-standing questions about &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.edweek.org/leadership/how-is-slavery-taught-in-u-s-schools-not-well-says-study/2018/02\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;how sensitive topics like slavery should be taught to young children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, especially in a school with few Black students. Black students make up less than 15% of the student population at about half of CPS’ 646 schools. That includes Portage Park Elementary, where 4% of students are Black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often schools with this demographic makeup also have few Black staff, and incidents in recent years have raised questions about &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2025/06/13/a-black-girl-endured-racist-bullying-in-a-mostly-white-chicago-school-did-cps-do-enough\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;whether these schools are welcoming and safe for Black students&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS officials said they did not know about Williams’ concern until WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times reached out to them. District officials are currently reviewing the lesson plan and how it was taught and “will work with all parties to make sure student(s) feel supported, based on reported concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School district officials said in their statement that the school’s principal reached out to the concerned parent to offer support, and that “the immediate priority is the well-being of the child, including making sure the child does not feel singled out in any way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said her son did feel singled out, and came home with a lot of questions that she was not prepared to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My son is having nightmares,” Williams said, noting her son has dreamed that men are chasing him. “We had to pray before he went to bed because he was just really nervous about going to sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family is considering therapy. The whole situation has left her feeling “very frustrated,” Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said she spoke with her son’s principal this week and that the principal and classroom teacher deny that students participated in a reenactment of slavery. That led to Williams re-questioning her son, who, she says, is insisting that he is telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe my son,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-440000\" name=\"image-440000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0962f4b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a0932ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fd8e51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A brick school displays signs that say &amp;quot;Panthers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Portage Park.&amp;quot;\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fd8e51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d854bcc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fd8e51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At about half of CPS schools, Black students make up less than 15% of the student body.

His teacher also said in the text that her son is “valued” and “that it is very important to me that he feels safe, respected and comfortable being himself at school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WBEZ and the Sun-Times reached out to the teacher and principal via email but did not receive a response. CPS officials instructed reporters to send questions through the communications department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said she’s now had difficult conversations about the history of slavery with her third grader that she didn’t plan to have until he was much older. She also had to make sure her son received accurate information about that period after her son said the teacher used inaccurate terms like “dictator” to describe an enslaver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said she’s worried that the teacher was “trying to disguise what really happened” during slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the text exchange, the teacher acknowledged he had not informed parents about that day’s slavery lesson and that going forward he would “make sure to communicate in advance when we are covering content that may be emotionally heavy so families have the opportunity to prepare and have conversations at home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some say slavery reenactments not appropriate at school&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents have raised concerns about the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/mock-auctions-pretending-to-flee-captors-do-simulations-have-a-place-in-lessons-on-slavery/2019/03\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;traumatizing effect slavery reenactments can have on students elsewhere&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, too. In 2019, New York’s attorney general investigated a teacher at a private school that cast &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/30/us/ny-school-mock-slave-auction-trnd#:~:text=A%20New%20York%20teacher%20made%20black%20students%20act%20as%20slaves%20in%20mock%20auctions&amp;amp;text=The%20Chapel%20School%20is%20in,miles%20north%20of%20midtown%20Manhattan.&amp;amp;text=A%20New%20York%20teacher%20singled,miles%20north%20of%20midtown%20Manhattan.\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Black students as slaves in a mock “auction”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as part of a social studies lesson. The school fired the teacher and agreed to make “significant changes” in the way it approached diversity and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There also have been questionable lessons in &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://wgntv.com/news/schools-reenactment-with-slaves-and-bounty-hunter-causes-controversy/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;southwest suburban Plainfield&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where students acted as enslaved people and bounty hunters, and in &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2018/04/27/students-role-playing-slaves-in-underground-railroad-simulation-angers-some-parents-others-praise-lesson/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;south suburban South Holland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where students reenacted aspects of the Underground Railroad. Some people, however, praised the South Holland school for taking that approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slavery reenactments are “completely inappropriate” at any grade level, according to Jose Vilson, the executive director of EduColor, an organization that supports and elevates the voices of educators of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At worst, it can often be traumatizing and stigmatizing and frankly, dilute the legacy of slavery,” he said. There are developmentally appropriate ways to teach children of varying ages about slavery, he added, but at 9 years old “it feels really awful to reenact something that traumatized millions and millions of people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vilson said it’s important for students to learn about not just the brutality of slavery, but also about the political and economic realities of the time, so they understand the broader context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southern Poverty Law Center’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/learning-for-justice/frameworks/teaching-hard-history/inquiry-design-models/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Teaching Hard History&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; guide, for example, suggests teaching about slavery using an inquiry-based approach where students research answers to questions like: How did slavery shape my state?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS officials wrote in a statement that they expect instruction to be “age-appropriate, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive” and it should not “place students in roles that could cause emotional harm and/or reinforce racial stereotypes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For young students, CPS emphasizes learning about history through storytelling, underscoring primary values like fairness and dignity, and the strength and contributions of Black people, rather than graphic detail or role-play. Instruction should always prioritize student safety, emotional well-being, and inclusion,” officials said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Something has to change’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janette Wilson, the national director of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s civil rights group, Operation Push, learned about what happened to Williams’ son when a family member of Williams’ put them in touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said teachers should use curriculum vetted by their school district when they teach sensitive topics, whether it be slavery, the Holocaust or the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said this is especially true in today’s climate where the Trump administration and Republican-led state legislatures have &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/map-where-critical-race-theory-is-under-attack/2021/06\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;pushed schools to limit what they teach about systemic racism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It needs to be systemwide so it does not leave any teacher or principal to teach what they feel,” Wilson said. “They have different levels of understanding and their own personal biases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS does not require teachers to use particular lesson plans. In 2021, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2023/03/31/can-chicago-public-schools-135-million-curriculum-be-a-pandemic-recovery-game-changer\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;district leaders unveiled an optional curriculum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for every subject and every grade and touted that it was designed to be culturally responsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-af0000\" name=\"image-af0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5e46257/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1d79a0d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b29095b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Alexis Williams and her son&amp;#x27;s father Juanyea Vinson Sr.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b29095b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2bbc8db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b29095b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexis Williams and her son’s father chose Portage Park Elementary because it was their neighborhood school and it seemed like a calm place to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to information on CPS’ website, Portage Park Elementary uses this vetted curriculum for its third through fifth grade social studies lessons. But CPS said the lesson on slavery was not a part of the district’s vetted curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said before this incident, her son had good experiences at the school he’s attended since preschool. She and her son’s father chose Portage Park because it’s their neighborhood school and it seemed like a calm place in a quiet neighborhood. Williams said the school has been attentive to her son’s peanut and banana allergies and often calls to ask if he’s allowed to eat certain foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams’ son cherishes the theater-focused after-school program where he can pursue his love of singing and dancing and is excelling academically as an honor-roll student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams wants to see the school take some action to avoid other parents going through anything like this in the future. This situation has left her wondering whether the school's broader Black history curriculum is up to snuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just feel like an apology is not enough for this situation,” Williams said. “What are you choosing to teach these kids? And if it's not the right way, then something has to change.”&lt;/p&gt;",

Garbarino, R-New York, began a lengthy committee hearing by calling state and local authorities' refusal to \"protect\" federal law enforcement officers and the deaths of Good and Pretti \"unacceptable and preventable,\" while also voicing support for a \"complete and impartial investigation.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We must take the temperature down and look at the record of enforcement actions through rational eyes,\" Garbarino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also a critique of Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, who led operations in Chicago and in Minneapolis and was demoted after Pretti's killing. U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told the panel —  which also included Rodney Scott, head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — that Bovino \"escalated the situation\" in Minneapolis.

Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., played a clip of Martinez detailing her wounds after being shot by federal agents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"What happened to Ms. Martinez, Ms. Good and Mr. Pretti is a scourge on this country and shameful chapter in our nation's history,\" Thompson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson also asked the three if they were involved in \"any planning on guarding precincts\" — after Trump suggested Republicans should \"nationalize\" voting. Both Lyons and Scott replied no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Illinois, told the three officials that they have perpetrated \"great evil\" and must answer for their \"lawlessness.\" Then she detailed the shooting of Villegas González, Pretti and Good, and called Martinez's shooting an attempted execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"DHS cannot be reformed,\" Ramirez said. \"It must be dismantled, and something new must take its place, because if we let DHS persist, it will continue to be a weapon that can be pointed at anyone the government considers the public enemy. And let me tell you, fascism always requires a public enemy.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyons blamed elected officials and protesters for escalating tensions that he said put federal agents in harm's way. He repeatedly declined to publicly comment on the deaths of Pretti and Good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott credited Trump for investing record amounts of money into recruiting, hiring and retaining immigration officers — and he called attacks on federal agents \"coordinated and well-funded.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is not peaceful protest,\" Scott said. \"No law enforcement officers should be put at personal risk simply for doing the job that we have asked them to do.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officials also provided some insight into their enforcement, including that there are \"approximately\" 3,000 ICE agents wearing body cameras, out of about 13,000 in the field. And 10,000 of 20,000 Border Patrol agents are now wearing body cameras. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyons also complained about Democrats referring to ICE as the Gestapo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I have a simple suggestion,\" U.S. Rep. Dan Goldman, D-New York, told him. \"If you don't want to be called a fascist regime or secret police, then stop acting like one.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

He often “restrained or assaulted” the victims to get them to turn over money they were paid in exchange for sex; he was arrested in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams would force one of the women, whom he referred to as “his money,” to take cocaine and other drugs to make her work more, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She later escaped from a hotel where Williams was keeping her, leaving her ID and other belongings behind, according to court documents. When she reached out to Williams to try to get her ID back, he told her he would give it to her if she got in his car. She got in the car as Williams sped away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was going to kill me,” the woman told a loved one who picked her up after she jumped out of the moving vehicle, according to court documents. She was taken to a police station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The harm that he inflicted on [the victims] is likely to reverberate throughout the rest of their lives,\" assistant U.S. attorneys Sushma Raju and Michelle Parthum wrote in the government’s sentencing memorandum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Williams’ crimes were violent, exploitative, and incredibly serious,” the prosecutors wrote in the document.&lt;/p&gt;",

We have seen moments where this nation reached for its better angels, but we are also witnessing, in real time, a dangerous return to the darkest chapters of our racial history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2026/02/06/donald-trump-racist-video-barack-michelle-obama-depiction-primates\"   &gt;viral video&lt;/a&gt; posted by President Donald Trump depicting former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes is not merely offensive — it is racist to its core, dehumanizing in its intent and dangerous in its impact. This is the same imagery used for centuries to justify slavery, segregation, lynching and the denial of Black humanity. You cannot separate this act from that history. It is soaked in the same old poison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That this occurred during Black History Month makes it even more tragic and revealing. At a time when America should be reflecting on the long road from chains to change, from cotton fields to the Oval Office, we are instead confronted with a reminder that racism is not dead — it is digital, it is viral and it is being amplified from the highest platforms in the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To blame an unnamed staffer is not leadership — it is cowardice. Leadership requires accountability. Leadership requires repentance. Leadership requires the moral courage to say, “I was wrong.” Silence and deflection only deepen the wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friends, this is not about partisan politics. As &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://leadersnetworkchicago.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;our local-based Leaders Network&lt;/a&gt; continues to say, this is about the soul of America. When a president normalizes racial mockery, he licenses hatred. When he refuses to apologize, he legitimizes bigotry. And when millions watch without consequence, the nation itself becomes complicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black people are frustrated because we recognize the pattern:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No apology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I remind America of this truth: Progress has never come from the comfort of the powerful — it has always come from the pressure of the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We marched before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We organized before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we will not be silent now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not apes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not jokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are children of the most high God!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And no video, no lie, no racist trope — no matter how viral — will ever strip us of our dignity. Mr. President, God is not mocked, and history will record that you used the highest office in the land to traffic in the lowest form of racism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rev.

So far, they’ve chosen the latter. &lt;u&gt;(&lt;/u&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/01/28/pritzker-still-deciding-if-illinois-will-join-federal-program-that-funds-private-school-scholarships\"   &gt;“Pritzker still deciding if Illinois will join federal program that funds private school scholarships,” Sun-Times Jan. 28&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new federal scholarship tax credit offers states a chance to expand educational opportunity at no cost. It requires no state spending and does not reduce public school funding. The governor simply must opt in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the program, taxpayers receive a dollar-for-dollar federal tax credit of up to $1,700 for donations to nonprofit scholarship organizations. Those organizations can support students in public schools, private schools or home schools. Scholarships would be available to families earning up to 300% of their area’s median income and could be used for tutoring, tuition, books, testing fees, dual enrollment courses, special education services and other educational expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/01/28/pritzker-still-deciding-if-illinois-will-join-federal-program-that-funds-private-school-scholarships?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=01292026%20Morning%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_content=01292026%20Morning%20Edition+CID_7790b25307bf0a387c02d4717b8d35ab&amp;amp;utm_source=cst_campaign_monitor&amp;amp;utm_term=Pritzker%20mulls%20if%20Illinois%20will%20join%20federal%20program%20that%20funds%20private%20school%20scholarships&amp;amp;tpcc=cst_cm\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Opposition&lt;/a&gt; to the program is driven largely by special interests and advocacy groups, particularly teachers unions, which have long resisted policies that give families options outside the systems they control. Union leaders have &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.illinoispolicy.org/ift-vows-to-fight-funding-to-help-public-school-kids/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;vowed&lt;/a&gt; to fight the federal scholarships — in part because of their association with the Trump administration — even though the money could very much go to the public schools they serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But refusing to opt in will not stop Illinois taxpayers from donating. Donors will still receive federal tax credits. The only result will be that scholarship dollars flow to children in other states instead of Illinois students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Student outcomes make the stakes clear. Only about half of Illinois students in grades three through eight read at grade level, and just 39% are proficient in math. Results are even worse for low-income, Black and Hispanic students. The new federal program could help these students access tutoring or cover fees for standardized testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could unlock vast new potential funding sources for booster clubs or educational foundations that serve students. The legal language makes it clear public schools can benefit. But unions don’t want to acknowledge that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is simple: Will state leaders continue to prioritize union demands, or finally put students first?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paul Vallas, adviser, Illinois Policy Institute, Palos Hills&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Minority rule &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t take too much solace from columnist &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2026/02/07/maga-trump-base-polls-republicans-conservatives-mona-charen\"   &gt;Mona Charen’s recent analysis&lt;/a&gt; that only a quarter of the population is full-on MAGA. The American electoral system is so full of quirks that a determined group of roughly 25% of the voters, particularly in favorable geographical configurations, is enough to have elected Donald Trump and cowed otherwise sane Republicans from facing the obvious, indeed inescapable, conclusion that this man is an abomination to the core principles of the rule of law and universal value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn’t just how those 25% behave.

Comfort here does not cancel responsibility there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calm of the lake contrasts painfully with the turbulence endured by my people, reminding me that safety, when unevenly shared, carries an obligation to speak and to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-410000\" name=\"module-410000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Commentary bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commentary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I spoke again with a colleague, a Kurdish academic still in Syria. What he described confirmed what many of us have been seeing online and then some. Beyond the images and posts are deeper, harsher realities: ongoing displacement, targeted abuses and fear intensified by the collapse of protection and t&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/kurdish-collapse-northeast-syria-key-things-watch\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;he steady drying up of humanitarian aid.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are not isolated incidents.

Aid corridors are shrinking. Schools, clinics and basic services are struggling to function. Civilians — especially women, children and older people — are paying the price of decisions made far from their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to remind everyone what is clear: From Chicago, this crisis may feel distant. But it should not be invisible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not a secret that the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/syria/fought-isis-syria-years-now-us-allies-say-abandoned-rcna255348\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;United States has been deeply entangled in Syria’s recent history.&lt;/a&gt; Kurdish communities were critical partners in the fight against the Islamic State group, a fact acknowledged by American officials across administrations. Yet partnership must mean more than words offered in wartime and forgotten in peacetime. Abandonment after sacrifice leaves scars — not only on those left behind, but on the moral credibility of those who turn away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a call for military intervention. It is a call for moral clarity and civic responsibility&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Americans — and as Chicagoans — we understand what it means when communities are treated as disposable, when security is invoked to excuse suffering and when silence becomes a form of consent. Our city’s history teaches us that justice begins when ordinary people insist that distant lives still matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can be done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, humanitarian access must be protected and expanded. Aid should never be politicized or withheld from civilians. Second, U.S. policymakers must use diplomatic leverage to press for civilian protection and accountability for abuses. Third, American civil society — universities, faith communities, human rights groups — must help keep this crisis visible, grounded in facts and human stories, not slogans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I write not only as a Kurd but also as a scholar who believes that knowledge carries responsibility. When suffering becomes normalized, speaking becomes a duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Northern Syria stands at a crossroads. One path leads toward further neglect, radicalization and despair. The other — harder, but necessary — leads toward dignity, humanitarian protection and the recognition that Kurdish lives are not bargaining chips in a regional power game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://goldininstitute.org/2025/09/16/stories-of-migration-chicago/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Chicago is a city built by immigrants, survivors and strivers. &lt;/a&gt;We know that solidarity does not stop at borders. The question is whether we will choose to act on that knowledge — or look away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there is a moral imperative to say this clearly and without hesitation: Kurdish Lives Matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;İbrahim Özdemir, Ph.D.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is a Kurdish professor based in Chicago who writes on environmental ethics, environmental justice, human rights, politics and the Middle East. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-070000\" name=\"module-070000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

He has a full head of hair with little graying, no facial wrinkles, and he's fairly fit. I'm 71 and look every day my age, probably older. I have graying hair — lots of it — but I like the color and will never dye it. I am fit, but the deep facial wrinkles and turkey neck emphasize my age. I \"thank\" my husband, a man I've lived with for 40 years, for this. He has given me years of stress and disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My issue: When we are out together, strangers inevitably tell him how shocked or surprised they are at how he \"doesn't look how old he is.\" I'm left sitting right there feeling as if they think I'm his mother. Every time this happens, for days and sometimes weeks, he will spend time staring at himself in the mirror and reminding me how lucky I am to have such a handsome husband. He has always had an ego problem, but it is getting worse. Is there a response to get him to get over himself? — &lt;i&gt;MR. HANDSOME'S WIFE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR WIFE:&lt;/b&gt; It is my observation that people who compulsively stare into mirrors do it not out of ego but because of insecurity. When your husband does this, does he actually TELL you how lucky you are to have such a handsome husband, or is that something you think he is thinking? He is the way his genetics have made him, and the same is true of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel bad about yourself because you think people are making unflattering comparisons between the two of you, consider discussing it with your dermatologist to see if there are some simple procedures that might make you feel better about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My husband is in his 60s. His brother, \"Al,\" (two years younger) has been living in their mother's house for the last 35 years. Before she died seven years ago, she put her house in my husband's name. For all those seven years, Al has been lying to him, promising he's going to move out \"any day now.\" If I try to tell my husband Al may have squatter's rights and is never going to move, my husband becomes verbally abusive and threatens me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that my husband is starting to face the fact that his brother will never move, he has become even more abusive toward me and is trying to drive me out of my own home. He knows I will get half of everything in a divorce because we have been married 31 years. When I suggested mediation, he kicked our dog. We also have loaded weapons in the house. He says he wants a divorce but can't afford one. — &lt;i&gt;UNEASY IN THE EAST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR UNEASY:&lt;/b&gt; You need more help than anyone can give you in a letter. Because your husband's behavior is escalating, you need to get out of there. The next time he becomes violent, instead of kicking the dog, he may hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) and talk with an advocate who can help you escape safely. You should also consult an attorney about how to protect yourself and file a police report about your husband's threatening behavior. He may not be able to afford a divorce, but you can't afford not to get one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Organizers will likely follow suit in 2026, with our bets on Jelly Roll, the genre’s man of the moment. He also headlines Summerfest in Milwaukee on July 4 and has nothing on the calendar after July 28; maybe he’ll bring tourmate Post Malone with him, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saba &lt;/b&gt;(Temp: 82 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;“I really think this might be the year,” said Ciocca about the Chicago-based rapper finally receiving prime-time Lolla treatment in 2026. Saba’s John Walt Day Foundation has routinely worked with the festival on opportunities for young, local up-and-comers and he has played afternoon slots, but his new record “From the Private Collection of Saba and No I.D.” is a total level-up worthy of a bigger stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karol G&lt;/b&gt; (Temp: 80 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;Lollapalooza’s strides to add diversity to the lineup, particularly with Latin music, will continue to be a focus this year — especially just coming off the attention spurred by the Super Bowl. Karol G could be a solid anchor for the fest; not only is she playing Coachella, but “people loved Karol's album last year, and she was just spotted dancing during Bad Bunny's Half-Time Show,” says Ciocca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robyn&lt;/b&gt; (Temp: 78 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;Last year’s Lolla guest spot with Gracie Abrams was just the warmup for the Swedish pop star. Robyn releases “Sexistential” in March, her first new record in nearly a decade, with early singles recalling the fervor of “Dancing On My Own.” Expect her to play all of it at Grant Park this summer while dancing with a lot of company. She just announced a tour stop here for September, but her calendar is wide open in August and we still think Lolla will be part of her itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tame Impala &lt;/b&gt;(Temp: 75 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;After Rüfüs Du Sol’s surprise headline spot last year, Tame Impala could be next to bring electronic vibes to the main stage. The group’s trancey light shows and psychedelic fits were made for festivals, but in Chicago, it hasn’t happened since Lollapalooza 2019 and Pitchfork Music Fest 2018. With their beloved new album “Deadbeat,” now is the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Violet Grohl&lt;/b&gt; (Temp: 73 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;There’s no chance of getting Foo Fighters this year (they play Soldier Field Aug. 8), but Lolla could take a chance on another Grohl — Dave’s daughter, Violet, for her big breakthrough. The young talent just signed with Republic Records and her first singles — “Thum” and “Applefish” — have that total ’90s Lolla &lt;i&gt;je ne sais quoi&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cardi B &lt;/b&gt;(Temp: 70 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;Another big hip-hop contender is Cardi B. “You can’t ignore she was in the news all last year,” said Ciocca, citing the rapper’s livestreamed court trial and her long-awaited sophomore album “Am I The Drama?” that dropped in September. Cardi does play United Center in March but it would seem outside of any Lolla exclusivity and likely may happen before the Lolla lineup is even announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-3e0000\" name=\"image-3e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ed8a66/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4648x2609+0+197/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2Fb1%2F17c9aa264ab78847fa9e49ca226a%2Flolla-072916-022.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31da668/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4648x2609+0+197/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2Fb1%2F17c9aa264ab78847fa9e49ca226a%2Flolla-072916-022.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/22e5780/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4648x2609+0+197/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2Fb1%2F17c9aa264ab78847fa9e49ca226a%2Flolla-072916-022.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The 1975 perform on day one of Lollapalooza in Grant Park on Thursday, July 28, 2016. | Lou Foglia/Sun-Times\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/22e5780/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4648x2609+0+197/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2Fb1%2F17c9aa264ab78847fa9e49ca226a%2Flolla-072916-022.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b9c78a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4648x2609+0+197/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2Fb1%2F17c9aa264ab78847fa9e49ca226a%2Flolla-072916-022.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/22e5780/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4648x2609+0+197/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2Fb1%2F17c9aa264ab78847fa9e49ca226a%2Flolla-072916-022.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1975 perform at Lollapalooza in 2016.

Instead, Lolla could go the solo route with a chart-topper like Rosé (plus, Bruno Mars has a tour break perfectly timed to pop up for “APT”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-480000\" name=\"image-480000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d270304/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4797x2692+0+254/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F39%2F8d61667f4c33a82e757138073a26%2Flolladay4-080425-115.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de9e86b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4797x2692+0+254/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F39%2F8d61667f4c33a82e757138073a26%2Flolladay4-080425-115.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4cd7d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4797x2692+0+254/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F39%2F8d61667f4c33a82e757138073a26%2Flolladay4-080425-115.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A$AP Rocky performs at the Bud Light stage during day four of Lollapalooza on Sunday, August 3, 2025. | Candace Dane Chambers /Sun-Times\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4cd7d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4797x2692+0+254/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F39%2F8d61667f4c33a82e757138073a26%2Flolladay4-080425-115.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/459bcea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4797x2692+0+254/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F39%2F8d61667f4c33a82e757138073a26%2Flolladay4-080425-115.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4cd7d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4797x2692+0+254/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F39%2F8d61667f4c33a82e757138073a26%2Flolladay4-080425-115.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A$AP Rocky performs at the Bud Light stage last year.

Lolla could give him a do-over this year now that the rapper’s long-overdue “Don’t Be Dumb” album finally came out in January. It also features composer Danny Elfman, which would make for a killer collab. But A$AP does have a United Center show in May, so it could be a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lana Del Rey &lt;/b&gt;(Temp: 42 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;Del Rey’s new country-tinged album “Stove” is due any day now (at least, it’s been teased that way for a while). If she can get it together in time, Lolla would be a great mass introduction to the new material. But so would Stagecoach, so she may hold off until 2027 for a proper festival appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lady Gaga&lt;/b&gt; (Temp: 40 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;It’s been a minute since Gaga headlined Lollapalooza, and she is still staging the Mayhem Ball in American cities through April. But the pop star is always one to reinvent and quickly move on to her next phase, so August could be too late to keep up the gothic opera façade. Even so, seeing her next-level production at Grant Park would be worth the admission alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pearl Jam&lt;/b&gt; (Temp: 38 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;The Seattle rock vets have a long history with Lollapalooza, from dominating the festival’s infamous 1992 touring caravan to returning in 2007 and playing international iterations like Brazil in the years since. They could use the platform to introduce their as-yet-unknown new drummer, but without new music since 2024, it’s a big “Wishlist” item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harry Styles&lt;/b&gt; (Temp: 35 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;We could have a better shot at a One Direction reunion than seeing Styles play Lolla at this point in his career, but hear us out. With his extensive Mexico City and Madison Square Garden residencies coming up, there’s a big void of other North American dates in 2026, and he does have July 30 and Aug. 2 open. But Ciocca is more of a “Belieber” that the male pop star slot would go to Justin Bieber after he takes on Coachella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-970000\" name=\"image-970000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a4024b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3243x1820+0+171/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F40%2F968600d448a3aa90de5bca868c69%2Flolla-073016-09.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ad0bd51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3243x1820+0+171/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F40%2F968600d448a3aa90de5bca868c69%2Flolla-073016-09.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f7437c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3243x1820+0+171/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F40%2F968600d448a3aa90de5bca868c69%2Flolla-073016-09.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Radiohead performs on day two of Lollapalooza in Grant Park, Friday night, July 29, 2016. | Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f7437c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3243x1820+0+171/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F40%2F968600d448a3aa90de5bca868c69%2Flolla-073016-09.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3af8f06/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3243x1820+0+171/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F40%2F968600d448a3aa90de5bca868c69%2Flolla-073016-09.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f7437c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3243x1820+0+171/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F40%2F968600d448a3aa90de5bca868c69%2Flolla-073016-09.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thom Yorke of Radiohead performs at Lollapalooza in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Radiohead &lt;/b&gt;(Temp: 30 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;It may be a chillier prediction, but we’re riding on the rumors that Radiohead may finally tour the U.S. this year and hoping on a wish and a prayer that those plans include Lollapalooza.

Washington Heights holds Walter H. Dyett High School for the Arts, named after the famed violinist and music educator. And in Bronzeville, an area that was known as Chicago’s “Black Belt” during the Great Migration starting around 1916, there’s Paul Laurence Dunbar Vocational Career Academy, named after the famed poet and playwright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this wasn’t always the case. Many of the district’s older schools are named after white men: George Washington High School serving Hegewisch and South Deering on the far East Side, Edgar Allan Poe Classical School in Pullman and Theodore Roosevelt High School in Albany Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what was the first public school in Chicago named in honor of a Black person?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer takes us back to 1936, when Chicago had just built its first high school to serve an exclusively Black student population, according to articles in the Chicago Defender.

By the late 1770s, he was living in what is currently Chicago with his Potawatomi wife, Kitahawa. Today, we know him as the “father of Chicago,” and his name is one we can see on monuments, even driving on Lake Shore Drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the 1930s were a much different landscape, and it took two concurrent movements to ignite this change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there are two stories here happening at the same time,” said Elizabeth Todd-Breland, associate professor of history at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “One is about the increasing knowledge of DuSable as an important figure of African descent during the 20th century.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other story has to do with the proposal to build the high school itself. The naming came with some controversy — the expected pushback from white residents, but also resistance from some in the school community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A boom in young, Black migrants&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wendell Phillips High School opened in the early 1900s to replace the South Division High School — the first high school on Chicago’s South Side, built in 1875. This new school was named after an abolitionist and advocate for the rights of Native Americans. In &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://archive.org/details/eulogyonwendellp00grim\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;his eulogy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Black lawyer George Lewis Ruffin said Phillips was \"the one White American wholly color-blind and free from race prejudice.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, wealthy white Chicagoans enrolled at Wendell Phillips, but with the Great Migration, the school’s demographics drastically changed. In 1907, 90 Black students attended Wendell Phillips, yet by 1919, Todd-Breland said, the school had become predominantly Black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the late 1920s, it would become overpopulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-fc0000\" name=\"image-fc0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/36d394a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+342/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F49%2F56fd47964afb9839308b4c8d205d%2Fi019126-pm.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9acabbf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+342/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F49%2F56fd47964afb9839308b4c8d205d%2Fi019126-pm.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24103ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+342/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F49%2F56fd47964afb9839308b4c8d205d%2Fi019126-pm.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Wendell Phillips High School\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24103ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+342/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F49%2F56fd47964afb9839308b4c8d205d%2Fi019126-pm.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/02b476b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+342/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F49%2F56fd47964afb9839308b4c8d205d%2Fi019126-pm.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24103ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+342/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F49%2F56fd47964afb9839308b4c8d205d%2Fi019126-pm.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exterior view of Wendell Phillips High School, located at 244 East Pershing Road, Chicago, Illinios, circa 1904.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnes-Crosby Company/Chicago History Museum, ICHi-019126; Barnes-Crosby Company, photographer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is bringing an influx of people into Chicago, and that included a lot of young people,” Todd-Breland said. “A lot of the migrants, or young people that would be born here, would be the children of migrants in that early part of the 20th century. And so, there was not enough capacity in existing schools.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black Chicagoans pushed for a new school, which was to be called New Wendell Phillips. New Deal Public Works Administration funds from the federal government helped push along the construction of the new building, and it opened in 1935. At first, the original building was converted to an elementary school. But once school officials realized the new school couldn’t fit all students, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/zlup/Historic_Preservation/Publications/Wendell_Phillips_High_School.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;it reopened&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a high school later in the 1930s. That 1875 structure still operates as a high school today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recognizing Chicago’s ‘first citizen’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1930s, prominent people pushed for a heightened knowledge of DuSable and an acknowledgement of his role as the city’s first citizen. Todd-Breland said the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/worlds-fair-exhibit-championed-black-chicago-32190327/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;National De Saible Memorial Society&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, led by educator Annie Oliver, advocated for a replica of DuSable’s cabin to be featured in the 1933 World’s Fair, which still &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/curious-city/2024/02/09/black-chicago-history-the-1940-american-negro-exposition\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;lacked Black representation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; decades after the Columbian Exposition in 1893.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-be0000\" name=\"image-be0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ad149df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+123/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fe6%2F0a76e8434c188aa62968cd6ae80c%2Fst70005638-0001.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d3766b3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+123/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fe6%2F0a76e8434c188aa62968cd6ae80c%2Fst70005638-0001.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a6d788/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+123/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fe6%2F0a76e8434c188aa62968cd6ae80c%2Fst70005638-0001.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Robert Taylor housing project\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a6d788/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+123/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fe6%2F0a76e8434c188aa62968cd6ae80c%2Fst70005638-0001.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/43ea357/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+123/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fe6%2F0a76e8434c188aa62968cd6ae80c%2Fst70005638-0001.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a6d788/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+123/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fe6%2F0a76e8434c188aa62968cd6ae80c%2Fst70005638-0001.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exterior of DuSable High School in 1966.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Sun-Times/ST-70005638-0001, Chicago Sun-Times collection, Chicago History Museum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The society’s advocacy was both significant and controversial. White settlers such as John Kinzie and others who lived at the Fort Dearborn outpost in the early 1800s were considered by many white people as Chicago’s first settlers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of white folks did not like this,” Todd-Breland said. “Because this contradicted a narrative of white settlers as being the first permanent residents of the area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A win for advocates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newspaper articles at the time reported Oliver and her group were also behind successfully changing New Wendell Phillips to DuSable High School. A June 1936 article in the New Journal and Guide confirms this influence: “Many who protested the change declared that DuSable was a Frenchman and not a Negro and that records differ as to his being Chicago’s first settler.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to little knowledge about DuSable, some Black people also wanted to keep the Wendell Phillips name, which by this point was a source of pride. Phillips had become the home of so many Black people who were building a new legacy at the school; their school spirit and sports wins even included cultivating players on the Savoy Big Five, the team that would become the Harlem Globetrotters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-090000\" name=\"image-090000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cd766ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5583x3133+0+666/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F26%2Fa9%2Fac6dfcc74c55a1480a527438ff88%2Fadn-0000172-pm.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b65c9a5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5583x3133+0+666/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F26%2Fa9%2Fac6dfcc74c55a1480a527438ff88%2Fadn-0000172-pm.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/458e561/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5583x3133+0+666/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F26%2Fa9%2Fac6dfcc74c55a1480a527438ff88%2Fadn-0000172-pm.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Victorious DuSable High School Basketball Team carrying Coach Jim Brown\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/458e561/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5583x3133+0+666/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F26%2Fa9%2Fac6dfcc74c55a1480a527438ff88%2Fadn-0000172-pm.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a97c65f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5583x3133+0+666/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F26%2Fa9%2Fac6dfcc74c55a1480a527438ff88%2Fadn-0000172-pm.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/458e561/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5583x3133+0+666/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F26%2Fa9%2Fac6dfcc74c55a1480a527438ff88%2Fadn-0000172-pm.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victorious DuSable High School Basketball Team carrying Coach Jim Brown to the locker room after they defeated Lakeview High School, Chicago, Illinois, March 12, 1954. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Daily News, Inc./ADN-0000172, Chicago Daily News/Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago History Museum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The history and legacy of Wendell Phillips High School was really important to Black Chicago,” Todd-Breland said. “But I do think what was significant about DuSable High School is that while Wendell Phillips was built in the early 1900s and originally served predominantly white students, DuSable was this first high school built specifically to serve Black students. And so, it was a point of pride outside of what the name of it was going to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black people advocating for — and then getting — a new, modern school with amenities felt like a big move toward equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Things like labs, facilities for electrical work, mechanical drawing, auto shop, woodwork; it had a library, a pool, rehearsal rooms for choral and instrumental music. All of these things that were part of an idea of what a modern school should have … these were things that were being built for Black folks,” Todd-Breland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c10000\" name=\"image-c10000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f259ab3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F32%2Faf0374a84541a0a62eb52bdd9673%2Fdusable-high-school.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d2c2f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F32%2Faf0374a84541a0a62eb52bdd9673%2Fdusable-high-school.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bcea7f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F32%2Faf0374a84541a0a62eb52bdd9673%2Fdusable-high-school.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"DuSable High School\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bcea7f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F32%2Faf0374a84541a0a62eb52bdd9673%2Fdusable-high-school.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/86e88e0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F32%2Faf0374a84541a0a62eb52bdd9673%2Fdusable-high-school.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bcea7f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F32%2Faf0374a84541a0a62eb52bdd9673%2Fdusable-high-school.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jamboree program at DuSable High School in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Sun Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a facility that felt equal to or maybe even superior to some of the white high schools in Chicago at the time was an extra point of pride for Black Chicagoans who fought for it, Todd-Breland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a time of segregation, and most of the advocacy for Black folks in Chicago around education during this period, it wasn’t really about desegregation,” she explained. “It was about funding equalization, and it was about educational equality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A lasting legacy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, DuSable High School was known for its renowned arts program and its booming 4,000-student population. But in the early 2000s, enrollment dropped significantly with the closure of a nearby public housing complex. DuSable was first reorganized into three separate schools operating in the building.
