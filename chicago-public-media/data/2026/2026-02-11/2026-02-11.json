Sandburg took full advantage of its opportunity on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/10/chicago-illinois-high-school-basketball-scores\"   &gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in Orland Park, upsetting &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/super-25-basketball-rankings/2026/02/08/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;No. 21 Lockport&lt;/a&gt; 55-52.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"That was most definitely fun,\" Eagles senior Jonah Johnson said. \"But that is how we are supposed to play every game. We need to come out with that same energy and keep it rolling.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson, a 6-2 guard, finished with 10 points and six rebounds. Will, his identical twin brother, led Sandburg with 13 points and six rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonah Johnson's post basket with 3:13 left put Sandburg (19-10, 9-6 SouthWest Suburban) ahead 51-45. Junior Daniel Morakinyo shot 4-for-6 from the free throw line in the final minute to see the win home for the Eagles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Johnson twins' father, Will, played at Western Michigan. The twins have already secured Sandburg's first winning season since 2018, and the overall goal is to win the school's first regional since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We lost games we shouldn't have at the start of the season,\" Jonah Johnson said. \"But his shows we can really compete against the better teams in our sectional.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a balanced offensive effort for Sandburg. Liiban Debala scored nine points and Malachi Perkis and Will Hooks each added five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockport has a pair of talented twins of its own in juniors Nojus and Nedas Venckus. They combined for 44 points, but the Porters' offense never seemed to find a rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We have [assistant coach Bob Curran] to thank for that,\" Jonah Johnson said. \"He's such a great coach and he's been working with us on our new defense. It really messed [Lockport] up and got them off their game.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d80000\" name=\"image-d80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f5aadf2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c5fd6f9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f27d249/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Sandburg&amp;#x27;s Will Johnson (3) takes the ball to the rim against Lockport.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f27d249/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2dc57e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f27d249/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandburg’s Will Johnson (3) takes the ball to the rim against Lockport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nojus Venckus made a three in the final seconds to tighten up the score.

His defensive system is good and the boys work really hard at it. We frustrated them.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandburg has won five consecutive games and beat Lincoln-Way Central and Lyons this season. But this is the first major win for the Eagles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"A lot of people saw us as a 6, 7 or 8-seed,\" Daniels said. \"This win changes that. We beat Lincoln-Way Central and Lockport head-to-head. We have to be considered for a 3 or 4-seed.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockport (22-5, 11-3) jumped into the Super 25 two weeks ago after knocking off Homewood-Flossmoor. The Porters have also lost to H-F twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockport and Sandburg are in the Class 4A Joliet West sectional. H-F and Marist seem locked in as the top two seeds, but it is totally up for grabs after that with the host Tigers, Brother Rice, Lincoln-Way Central, Thornwood and now Sandburg all in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-b40000\" name=\"html-embed-module-b40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"No Shot Clock, Ep. 201: Conference quick takes\" allowtransparency=\"true\" height=\"150\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);height:150px;\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=5patj-1a40c88-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=auto&amp;logo_link=episode_page&amp;btn-skin=c73a3a\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

She honked her horn, yelled “la migra” and tried to warn people about the agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she pulled her Rogue beside the Tahoe near 39th and Kedzie, where she said Exum swerved toward her Rogue and their vehicles swiped each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez said she stopped her Rogue but feared being “manhandled” by the agents, so she drove away. She said she drove to her “farthest left,” to avoid the agents climbing out of their vehicle on her right. But as she passed, she said Exum opened fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She pulled over at a repair shop, was taken to a hospital and eventually into federal custody. Authorities then alleged that Martinez and another man “rammed” Exum’s car.&lt;/p&gt;",

Des Moines is about 330 miles west of Chicago, while the Quad Cities are about 170 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears own 326 acres in Arlington Heights, which the team has declared to be the only suitable site in Cook County. Late last year, though, the Bears began discussing building across state lines in Indiana. Last month, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell joined Bears chairman George McCaskey and president/CEO Kevin Warren on tours of Arlington Heights and two Indiana sites — near Wolf Lake in Hammond and the Hard Rock Casino in Gary. The city of Portage will throw its hat into the ring Wednesday, albeit as a long shot, when it holds a press conference touting “Halas Harbor\" along the Burns Waterway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren was hired more than three years ago to seal a stadium deal, but the team’s search drags on. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said this week that talks to keep the Bears in Illinois were progressing even as Indiana continued its flirtation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-bc0001\" name=\"list-bc0001\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, inverseColors=false, pagination=[{body=[Next Page], href=?p=2, _template=/link/Link.hbs, contentId=null, pianoSectionSlug=null, target=null}], footerBgColor=#000000, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, pullQuoteIcon=[{image=null, narrowImage=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=null}], headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, items=[{type=Image, media=[{ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/19/3c/f5982442454f9f002a0e68aff183/ap26040063399644.jpg, width=3539, height=2360}, alt=Bad Bunny performs during halftime of Super Bowl LX between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, in Santa Clara, California. , narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/19/3c/f5982442454f9f002a0e68aff183/ap26040063399644.jpg, width=3539, height=2360}}], publishDate=February 10, 2026 07:23 PM, wordCount=640, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, timestamp=1770772980000, isFeatured=false, anchorId=promo-170000, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/associated-press, bio=[{items=[The Associated Press is an independent, not-for-profit news cooperative headquartered in New York City.

That would make it the fourth-most watched halftime behind Kendrick Lamar (133.5 million, 2025), Michael Jackson (133.4 million, 1993) and Usher (129.3 million, 2024).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Peak audience sets U.S. record&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audience for the game peaked at 137.8 million viewers during the second quarter (6:45-7 p.m. Chicago time), which is a record. That surpassed the previous mark of 137.7 million during the second quarter of last year's Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's audience ended a streak where the last four Super Bowls had experienced audience increases. It is the fifth straight year the game has averaged over 100 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three straight years of Super Bowls that came down to the final minute, the last two have lacked excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday's game was the second in Super Bowl history in which a touchdown had not been scored in the first three quarters. Seattle was up 12-0 going into the final 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's game was decided in the first half as Philadelphia built a 24-0 lead en route to a 40-22 victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bad Bunny vs. Kid Rock&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Turning Point USA halftime show featuring Kid Rock peaked at 5 million at one point on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nielsen did not measure any of the YouTube livestream viewership. Of the linear networks that carried it, the only one Nielsen measures is broadcast network Charge! Full Nielsen ratings for the prior week will be released on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to YouTube figures though, there have been 21,208,583 views of the alternate halftime show through Tuesday night, according to the conservative organization's page. Bad Bunny's show has already had 61,311,972 views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Halftime show on social media&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total social media consumption of Bad Bunny's halftime show set a record of 4 billion views after the first 24 hours, according to the NFL and Ripple Analytics. That is a 137% increase over last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social media figures include fans, owned platforms, broadcast partners and influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFL said over 55% of all social views came from international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full global viewership for the halftime show is expected to be available early next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Spanish audience record&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telemundo averaged 3.3 million viewers, making it the most-watched Super Bowl Spanish-language broadcast in the United States. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the U.S. since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audience peaked during the halftime show, averaging 4.8 million viewers — also making it the most-watched Super Bowl halftime in Spanish-language history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Olympics benefit from Super Bowl&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBC's \"Primetime in Milan\" Olympic show, which featured the women's downhill and team figure skating events, averaged 42 million viewers, the network's largest Winter Olympics audience since Day 2 of the 2014 Sochi Games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also was a 73% increase from the Olympics show after Super Bowl 56 (24.3 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The Super Bowl and the NFL once again delivered a blockbuster audience across the NBC broadcast network, Peacock and Telemundo, and provided an unprecedented lead-in to our Primetime in Milan coverage,\" NBC Sports President Rick Cordella said in a statement. \"The Super Bowl and the Olympics are the two most powerful events in the world, and we salute our talented production, tech and announce teams who delivered best-in-class presentations for our viewers, stations and partners.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Other NFL figures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFL playoffs averaged 37 million viewers the first three weekends, up 5% from last year and the second-most watched in the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That followed a regular season that averaged 18.7 million, the second-highest since audience averages began being kept in 1988. It was a 10% increase from last season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Williams’ son told her that his teacher had him play the role of “dictator” during the lesson and instructed him to pull a classmate out of their chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams’ son also told her that other students were asked to use tape — meant to symbolize chains — to bind a classmate’s hands. According to Williams’ son, the teacher said the students with their hands bound would be shipped off in a cage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the role-playing, according to Williams’ son, the teacher put on an educational video about slavery. The teacher, who is white, then told her son that if he felt uncomfortable watching it, he could step out of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Public Schools officials said in a statement that they do not support simulations or reenactments of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the incident points to long-standing questions about &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.edweek.org/leadership/how-is-slavery-taught-in-u-s-schools-not-well-says-study/2018/02\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;how sensitive topics like slavery should be taught to young children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, especially in a school with few Black students. Black students make up less than 15% of the student population at about half of CPS’ 646 schools. That includes Portage Park Elementary, where 4% of students are Black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often schools with this demographic makeup also have few Black staff, and incidents in recent years have raised questions about &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2025/06/13/a-black-girl-endured-racist-bullying-in-a-mostly-white-chicago-school-did-cps-do-enough\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;whether these schools are welcoming and safe for Black students&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS officials said they did not know about Williams’ concern until WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times reached out to them. District officials are currently reviewing the lesson plan and how it was taught and “will work with all parties to make sure student(s) feel supported, based on reported concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School district officials said in their statement that the school’s principal reached out to the concerned parent to offer support, and that “the immediate priority is the well-being of the child, including making sure the child does not feel singled out in any way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said her son did feel singled out, and came home with a lot of questions that she was not prepared to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My son is having nightmares,” Williams said, noting her son has dreamed that men are chasing him. “We had to pray before he went to bed because he was just really nervous about going to sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family is considering therapy. The whole situation has left her feeling “very frustrated,” Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said she spoke with her son’s principal this week and that the principal and classroom teacher deny that students participated in a reenactment of slavery. That led to Williams re-questioning her son, who, she says, is insisting that he is telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe my son,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-440000\" name=\"image-440000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0962f4b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a0932ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fd8e51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A brick school displays signs that say &amp;quot;Panthers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Portage Park.&amp;quot;\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fd8e51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d854bcc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fd8e51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At about half of CPS schools, Black students make up less than 15% of the student body.

His teacher also said in the text that her son is “valued” and “that it is very important to me that he feels safe, respected and comfortable being himself at school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WBEZ and the Sun-Times reached out to the teacher and principal via email but did not receive a response. CPS officials instructed reporters to send questions through the communications department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said she’s now had difficult conversations about the history of slavery with her third grader that she didn’t plan to have until he was much older. She also had to make sure her son received accurate information about that period after her son said the teacher used inaccurate terms like “dictator” to describe an enslaver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said she’s worried that the teacher was “trying to disguise what really happened” during slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the text exchange, the teacher acknowledged he had not informed parents about that day’s slavery lesson and that going forward he would “make sure to communicate in advance when we are covering content that may be emotionally heavy so families have the opportunity to prepare and have conversations at home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some say slavery reenactments not appropriate at school&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents have raised concerns about the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/mock-auctions-pretending-to-flee-captors-do-simulations-have-a-place-in-lessons-on-slavery/2019/03\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;traumatizing effect slavery reenactments can have on students elsewhere&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, too. In 2019, New York’s attorney general investigated a teacher at a private school that cast &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/30/us/ny-school-mock-slave-auction-trnd#:~:text=A%20New%20York%20teacher%20made%20black%20students%20act%20as%20slaves%20in%20mock%20auctions&amp;amp;text=The%20Chapel%20School%20is%20in,miles%20north%20of%20midtown%20Manhattan.&amp;amp;text=A%20New%20York%20teacher%20singled,miles%20north%20of%20midtown%20Manhattan.\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Black students as slaves in a mock “auction”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as part of a social studies lesson. The school fired the teacher and agreed to make “significant changes” in the way it approached diversity and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There also have been questionable lessons in &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://wgntv.com/news/schools-reenactment-with-slaves-and-bounty-hunter-causes-controversy/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;southwest suburban Plainfield&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where students acted as enslaved people and bounty hunters, and in &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2018/04/27/students-role-playing-slaves-in-underground-railroad-simulation-angers-some-parents-others-praise-lesson/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;south suburban South Holland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where students reenacted aspects of the Underground Railroad. Some people, however, praised the South Holland school for taking that approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slavery reenactments are “completely inappropriate” at any grade level, according to Jose Vilson, the executive director of EduColor, an organization that supports and elevates the voices of educators of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At worst, it can often be traumatizing and stigmatizing and frankly, dilute the legacy of slavery,” he said. There are developmentally appropriate ways to teach children of varying ages about slavery, he added, but at 9 years old “it feels really awful to reenact something that traumatized millions and millions of people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vilson said it’s important for students to learn about not just the brutality of slavery, but also about the political and economic realities of the time, so they understand the broader context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southern Poverty Law Center’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/learning-for-justice/frameworks/teaching-hard-history/inquiry-design-models/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Teaching Hard History&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; guide, for example, suggests teaching about slavery using an inquiry-based approach where students research answers to questions like: How did slavery shape my state?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS officials wrote in a statement that they expect instruction to be “age-appropriate, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive” and it should not “place students in roles that could cause emotional harm and/or reinforce racial stereotypes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For young students, CPS emphasizes learning about history through storytelling, underscoring primary values like fairness and dignity, and the strength and contributions of Black people, rather than graphic detail or role-play. Instruction should always prioritize student safety, emotional well-being, and inclusion,” officials said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Something has to change’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janette Wilson, the national director of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s civil rights group, Operation Push, learned about what happened to Williams’ son when a family member of Williams’ put them in touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said teachers should use curriculum vetted by their school district when they teach sensitive topics, whether it be slavery, the Holocaust or the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said this is especially true in today’s climate where the Trump administration and Republican-led state legislatures have &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/map-where-critical-race-theory-is-under-attack/2021/06\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;pushed schools to limit what they teach about systemic racism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It needs to be systemwide so it does not leave any teacher or principal to teach what they feel,” Wilson said. “They have different levels of understanding and their own personal biases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS does not require teachers to use particular lesson plans. In 2021, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2023/03/31/can-chicago-public-schools-135-million-curriculum-be-a-pandemic-recovery-game-changer\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;district leaders unveiled an optional curriculum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for every subject and every grade and touted that it was designed to be culturally responsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-af0000\" name=\"image-af0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5e46257/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1d79a0d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b29095b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Alexis Williams and her son&amp;#x27;s father Juanyea Vinson Sr.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b29095b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2bbc8db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b29095b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexis Williams and her son’s father chose Portage Park Elementary because it was their neighborhood school and it seemed like a calm place to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to information on CPS’ website, Portage Park Elementary uses this vetted curriculum for its third through fifth grade social studies lessons. But CPS said the lesson on slavery was not a part of the district’s vetted curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said before this incident, her son had good experiences at the school he’s attended since preschool. She and her son’s father chose Portage Park because it’s their neighborhood school and it seemed like a calm place in a quiet neighborhood. Williams said the school has been attentive to her son’s peanut and banana allergies and often calls to ask if he’s allowed to eat certain foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams’ son cherishes the theater-focused after-school program where he can pursue his love of singing and dancing and is excelling academically as an honor-roll student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams wants to see the school take some action to avoid other parents going through anything like this in the future. This situation has left her wondering whether the school's broader Black history curriculum is up to snuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just feel like an apology is not enough for this situation,” Williams said. “What are you choosing to teach these kids? And if it's not the right way, then something has to change.”&lt;/p&gt;",

Garbarino, R-New York, began a lengthy committee hearing by calling state and local authorities' refusal to \"protect\" federal law enforcement officers and the deaths of Good and Pretti \"unacceptable and preventable,\" while also voicing support for a \"complete and impartial investigation.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We must take the temperature down and look at the record of enforcement actions through rational eyes,\" Garbarino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also a critique of Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, who led operations in Chicago and in Minneapolis and was demoted after Pretti's killing. U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told the panel —  which also included Rodney Scott, head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — that Bovino \"escalated the situation\" in Minneapolis.

Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., played a clip of Martinez detailing her wounds after being shot by federal agents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"What happened to Ms. Martinez, Ms. Good and Mr. Pretti is a scourge on this country and shameful chapter in our nation's history,\" Thompson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson also asked the three if they were involved in \"any planning on guarding precincts\" — after Trump suggested Republicans should \"nationalize\" voting. Both Lyons and Scott replied no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Illinois, told the three officials that they have perpetrated \"great evil\" and must answer for their \"lawlessness.\" Then she detailed the shooting of Villegas González, Pretti and Good, and called Martinez's shooting an attempted execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"DHS cannot be reformed,\" Ramirez said. \"It must be dismantled, and something new must take its place, because if we let DHS persist, it will continue to be a weapon that can be pointed at anyone the government considers the public enemy. And let me tell you, fascism always requires a public enemy.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyons blamed elected officials and protesters for escalating tensions that he said put federal agents in harm's way. He repeatedly declined to publicly comment on the deaths of Pretti and Good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott credited Trump for investing record amounts of money into recruiting, hiring and retaining immigration officers — and he called attacks on federal agents \"coordinated and well-funded.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is not peaceful protest,\" Scott said. \"No law enforcement officers should be put at personal risk simply for doing the job that we have asked them to do.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officials also provided some insight into their enforcement, including that there are \"approximately\" 3,000 ICE agents wearing body cameras, out of about 13,000 in the field. And 10,000 of 20,000 Border Patrol agents are now wearing body cameras. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyons also complained about Democrats referring to ICE as the Gestapo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I have a simple suggestion,\" U.S. Rep. Dan Goldman, D-New York, told him. \"If you don't want to be called a fascist regime or secret police, then stop acting like one.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

He often “restrained or assaulted” the victims to get them to turn over money they were paid in exchange for sex; he was arrested in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams would force one of the women, whom he referred to as “his money,” to take cocaine and other drugs to make her work more, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She later escaped from a hotel where Williams was keeping her, leaving her ID and other belongings behind, according to court documents. When she reached out to Williams to try to get her ID back, he told her he would give it to her if she got in his car. She got in the car as Williams sped away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was going to kill me,” the woman told a loved one who picked her up after she jumped out of the moving vehicle, according to court documents. She was taken to a police station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The harm that he inflicted on [the victims] is likely to reverberate throughout the rest of their lives,\" assistant U.S. attorneys Sushma Raju and Michelle Parthum wrote in the government’s sentencing memorandum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Williams’ crimes were violent, exploitative, and incredibly serious,” the prosecutors wrote in the document.&lt;/p&gt;",
