Sandburg took full advantage of its opportunity on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/10/chicago-illinois-high-school-basketball-scores\"   &gt;Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in Orland Park, upsetting &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/super-25-basketball-rankings/2026/02/08/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;No. 21 Lockport&lt;/a&gt; 55-52.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"That was most definitely fun,\" Eagles senior Jonah Johnson said. \"But that is how we are supposed to play every game. We need to come out with that same energy and keep it rolling.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson, a 6-2 guard, finished with 10 points and six rebounds. Will, his identical twin brother, led Sandburg with 13 points and six rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonah Johnson's post basket with 3:13 left put Sandburg (19-10, 9-6 SouthWest Suburban) ahead 51-45. Junior Daniel Morakinyo shot 4-for-6 from the free throw line in the final minute to see the win home for the Eagles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Johnson twins' father, Will, played at Western Michigan. The twins have already secured Sandburg's first winning season since 2018, and the overall goal is to win the school's first regional since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We lost games we shouldn't have at the start of the season,\" Jonah Johnson said. \"But his shows we can really compete against the better teams in our sectional.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a balanced offensive effort for Sandburg. Liiban Debala scored nine points and Malachi Perkis and Will Hooks each added five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockport has a pair of talented twins of its own in juniors Nojus and Nedas Venckus. They combined for 44 points, but the Porters' offense never seemed to find a rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We have [assistant coach Bob Curran] to thank for that,\" Jonah Johnson said. \"He's such a great coach and he's been working with us on our new defense. It really messed [Lockport] up and got them off their game.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d80000\" name=\"image-d80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f5aadf2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c5fd6f9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f27d249/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Sandburg&amp;#x27;s Will Johnson (3) takes the ball to the rim against Lockport.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f27d249/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2dc57e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f27d249/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff3%2F24%2F9a7c9ba54689a9eef9d606b8749d%2Fob-cst-021126-7003.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandburg’s Will Johnson (3) takes the ball to the rim against Lockport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nojus Venckus made a three in the final seconds to tighten up the score.

His defensive system is good and the boys work really hard at it. We frustrated them.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandburg has won five consecutive games and beat Lincoln-Way Central and Lyons this season. But this is the first major win for the Eagles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"A lot of people saw us as a 6, 7 or 8-seed,\" Daniels said. \"This win changes that. We beat Lincoln-Way Central and Lockport head-to-head. We have to be considered for a 3 or 4-seed.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockport (22-5, 11-3) jumped into the Super 25 two weeks ago after knocking off Homewood-Flossmoor. The Porters have also lost to H-F twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockport and Sandburg are in the Class 4A Joliet West sectional. H-F and Marist seem locked in as the top two seeds, but it is totally up for grabs after that with the host Tigers, Brother Rice, Lincoln-Way Central, Thornwood and now Sandburg all in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-b40000\" name=\"html-embed-module-b40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"No Shot Clock, Ep. 201: Conference quick takes\" allowtransparency=\"true\" height=\"150\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);height:150px;\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=5patj-1a40c88-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=auto&amp;logo_link=episode_page&amp;btn-skin=c73a3a\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

She honked her horn, yelled “la migra” and tried to warn people about the agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she pulled her Rogue beside the Tahoe near 39th and Kedzie, where she said Exum swerved toward her Rogue and their vehicles swiped each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez said she stopped her Rogue but feared being “manhandled” by the agents, so she drove away. She said she drove to her “farthest left,” to avoid the agents climbing out of their vehicle on her right. But as she passed, she said Exum opened fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She pulled over at a repair shop, was taken to a hospital and eventually into federal custody. Authorities then alleged that Martinez and another man “rammed” Exum’s car.&lt;/p&gt;",

Des Moines is about 330 miles west of Chicago, while the Quad Cities are about 170 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears own 326 acres in Arlington Heights, which the team has declared to be the only suitable site in Cook County. Late last year, though, the Bears began discussing building across state lines in Indiana. Last month, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell joined Bears chairman George McCaskey and president/CEO Kevin Warren on tours of Arlington Heights and two Indiana sites — near Wolf Lake in Hammond and the Hard Rock Casino in Gary. The city of Portage will throw its hat into the ring Wednesday, albeit as a long shot, when it holds a press conference touting “Halas Harbor\" along the Burns Waterway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren was hired more than three years ago to seal a stadium deal, but the team’s search drags on. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said this week that talks to keep the Bears in Illinois were progressing even as Indiana continued its flirtation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-bc0001\" name=\"list-bc0001\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, inverseColors=false, pagination=[{body=[Next Page], href=?p=2, _template=/link/Link.hbs, contentId=null, pianoSectionSlug=null, target=null}], footerBgColor=#000000, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, pullQuoteIcon=[{image=null, narrowImage=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=null}], headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, items=[{type=Image, media=[{ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/19/3c/f5982442454f9f002a0e68aff183/ap26040063399644.jpg, width=3539, height=2360}, alt=Bad Bunny performs during halftime of Super Bowl LX between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, in Santa Clara, California. , narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/19/3c/f5982442454f9f002a0e68aff183/ap26040063399644.jpg, width=3539, height=2360}}], publishDate=February 10, 2026 07:23 PM, wordCount=640, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, timestamp=1770772980000, isFeatured=false, anchorId=promo-170000, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/associated-press, bio=[{items=[The Associated Press is an independent, not-for-profit news cooperative headquartered in New York City.

That would make it the fourth-most watched halftime behind Kendrick Lamar (133.5 million, 2025), Michael Jackson (133.4 million, 1993) and Usher (129.3 million, 2024).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Peak audience sets U.S. record&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audience for the game peaked at 137.8 million viewers during the second quarter (6:45-7 p.m. Chicago time), which is a record. That surpassed the previous mark of 137.7 million during the second quarter of last year's Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's audience ended a streak where the last four Super Bowls had experienced audience increases. It is the fifth straight year the game has averaged over 100 million viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three straight years of Super Bowls that came down to the final minute, the last two have lacked excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday's game was the second in Super Bowl history in which a touchdown had not been scored in the first three quarters. Seattle was up 12-0 going into the final 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's game was decided in the first half as Philadelphia built a 24-0 lead en route to a 40-22 victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bad Bunny vs. Kid Rock&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Turning Point USA halftime show featuring Kid Rock peaked at 5 million at one point on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nielsen did not measure any of the YouTube livestream viewership. Of the linear networks that carried it, the only one Nielsen measures is broadcast network Charge! Full Nielsen ratings for the prior week will be released on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to YouTube figures though, there have been 21,208,583 views of the alternate halftime show through Tuesday night, according to the conservative organization's page. Bad Bunny's show has already had 61,311,972 views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Halftime show on social media&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total social media consumption of Bad Bunny's halftime show set a record of 4 billion views after the first 24 hours, according to the NFL and Ripple Analytics. That is a 137% increase over last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social media figures include fans, owned platforms, broadcast partners and influencers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFL said over 55% of all social views came from international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full global viewership for the halftime show is expected to be available early next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Spanish audience record&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telemundo averaged 3.3 million viewers, making it the most-watched Super Bowl Spanish-language broadcast in the United States. The Super Bowl has been televised in Spanish in the U.S. since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audience peaked during the halftime show, averaging 4.8 million viewers — also making it the most-watched Super Bowl halftime in Spanish-language history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Olympics benefit from Super Bowl&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBC's \"Primetime in Milan\" Olympic show, which featured the women's downhill and team figure skating events, averaged 42 million viewers, the network's largest Winter Olympics audience since Day 2 of the 2014 Sochi Games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also was a 73% increase from the Olympics show after Super Bowl 56 (24.3 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The Super Bowl and the NFL once again delivered a blockbuster audience across the NBC broadcast network, Peacock and Telemundo, and provided an unprecedented lead-in to our Primetime in Milan coverage,\" NBC Sports President Rick Cordella said in a statement. \"The Super Bowl and the Olympics are the two most powerful events in the world, and we salute our talented production, tech and announce teams who delivered best-in-class presentations for our viewers, stations and partners.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Other NFL figures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFL playoffs averaged 37 million viewers the first three weekends, up 5% from last year and the second-most watched in the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That followed a regular season that averaged 18.7 million, the second-highest since audience averages began being kept in 1988. It was a 10% increase from last season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Williams’ son told her that his teacher had him play the role of “dictator” during the lesson and instructed him to pull a classmate out of their chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams’ son also told her that other students were asked to use tape — meant to symbolize chains — to bind a classmate’s hands. According to Williams’ son, the teacher said the students with their hands bound would be shipped off in a cage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the role-playing, according to Williams’ son, the teacher put on an educational video about slavery. The teacher, who is white, then told her son that if he felt uncomfortable watching it, he could step out of the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Public Schools officials said in a statement that they do not support simulations or reenactments of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the incident points to long-standing questions about &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.edweek.org/leadership/how-is-slavery-taught-in-u-s-schools-not-well-says-study/2018/02\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;how sensitive topics like slavery should be taught to young children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, especially in a school with few Black students. Black students make up less than 15% of the student population at about half of CPS’ 646 schools. That includes Portage Park Elementary, where 4% of students are Black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often schools with this demographic makeup also have few Black staff, and incidents in recent years have raised questions about &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2025/06/13/a-black-girl-endured-racist-bullying-in-a-mostly-white-chicago-school-did-cps-do-enough\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;whether these schools are welcoming and safe for Black students&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS officials said they did not know about Williams’ concern until WBEZ and the Chicago Sun-Times reached out to them. District officials are currently reviewing the lesson plan and how it was taught and “will work with all parties to make sure student(s) feel supported, based on reported concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School district officials said in their statement that the school’s principal reached out to the concerned parent to offer support, and that “the immediate priority is the well-being of the child, including making sure the child does not feel singled out in any way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said her son did feel singled out, and came home with a lot of questions that she was not prepared to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My son is having nightmares,” Williams said, noting her son has dreamed that men are chasing him. “We had to pray before he went to bed because he was just really nervous about going to sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family is considering therapy. The whole situation has left her feeling “very frustrated,” Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said she spoke with her son’s principal this week and that the principal and classroom teacher deny that students participated in a reenactment of slavery. That led to Williams re-questioning her son, who, she says, is insisting that he is telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe my son,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-440000\" name=\"image-440000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0962f4b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a0932ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fd8e51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A brick school displays signs that say &amp;quot;Panthers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Portage Park.&amp;quot;\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fd8e51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d854bcc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8fd8e51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F59%2F140fbb1c465fb4ccee9f68f9b08b%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-029.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At about half of CPS schools, Black students make up less than 15% of the student body.

His teacher also said in the text that her son is “valued” and “that it is very important to me that he feels safe, respected and comfortable being himself at school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WBEZ and the Sun-Times reached out to the teacher and principal via email but did not receive a response. CPS officials instructed reporters to send questions through the communications department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said she’s now had difficult conversations about the history of slavery with her third grader that she didn’t plan to have until he was much older. She also had to make sure her son received accurate information about that period after her son said the teacher used inaccurate terms like “dictator” to describe an enslaver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said she’s worried that the teacher was “trying to disguise what really happened” during slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the text exchange, the teacher acknowledged he had not informed parents about that day’s slavery lesson and that going forward he would “make sure to communicate in advance when we are covering content that may be emotionally heavy so families have the opportunity to prepare and have conversations at home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some say slavery reenactments not appropriate at school&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents have raised concerns about the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/mock-auctions-pretending-to-flee-captors-do-simulations-have-a-place-in-lessons-on-slavery/2019/03\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;traumatizing effect slavery reenactments can have on students elsewhere&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, too. In 2019, New York’s attorney general investigated a teacher at a private school that cast &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/30/us/ny-school-mock-slave-auction-trnd#:~:text=A%20New%20York%20teacher%20made%20black%20students%20act%20as%20slaves%20in%20mock%20auctions&amp;amp;text=The%20Chapel%20School%20is%20in,miles%20north%20of%20midtown%20Manhattan.&amp;amp;text=A%20New%20York%20teacher%20singled,miles%20north%20of%20midtown%20Manhattan.\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Black students as slaves in a mock “auction”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as part of a social studies lesson. The school fired the teacher and agreed to make “significant changes” in the way it approached diversity and inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There also have been questionable lessons in &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://wgntv.com/news/schools-reenactment-with-slaves-and-bounty-hunter-causes-controversy/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;southwest suburban Plainfield&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where students acted as enslaved people and bounty hunters, and in &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2018/04/27/students-role-playing-slaves-in-underground-railroad-simulation-angers-some-parents-others-praise-lesson/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;south suburban South Holland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where students reenacted aspects of the Underground Railroad. Some people, however, praised the South Holland school for taking that approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slavery reenactments are “completely inappropriate” at any grade level, according to Jose Vilson, the executive director of EduColor, an organization that supports and elevates the voices of educators of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At worst, it can often be traumatizing and stigmatizing and frankly, dilute the legacy of slavery,” he said. There are developmentally appropriate ways to teach children of varying ages about slavery, he added, but at 9 years old “it feels really awful to reenact something that traumatized millions and millions of people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vilson said it’s important for students to learn about not just the brutality of slavery, but also about the political and economic realities of the time, so they understand the broader context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southern Poverty Law Center’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/learning-for-justice/frameworks/teaching-hard-history/inquiry-design-models/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Teaching Hard History&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; guide, for example, suggests teaching about slavery using an inquiry-based approach where students research answers to questions like: How did slavery shape my state?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS officials wrote in a statement that they expect instruction to be “age-appropriate, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive” and it should not “place students in roles that could cause emotional harm and/or reinforce racial stereotypes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For young students, CPS emphasizes learning about history through storytelling, underscoring primary values like fairness and dignity, and the strength and contributions of Black people, rather than graphic detail or role-play. Instruction should always prioritize student safety, emotional well-being, and inclusion,” officials said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Something has to change’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janette Wilson, the national director of the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s civil rights group, Operation Push, learned about what happened to Williams’ son when a family member of Williams’ put them in touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said teachers should use curriculum vetted by their school district when they teach sensitive topics, whether it be slavery, the Holocaust or the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said this is especially true in today’s climate where the Trump administration and Republican-led state legislatures have &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/map-where-critical-race-theory-is-under-attack/2021/06\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;pushed schools to limit what they teach about systemic racism&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It needs to be systemwide so it does not leave any teacher or principal to teach what they feel,” Wilson said. “They have different levels of understanding and their own personal biases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS does not require teachers to use particular lesson plans. In 2021, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2023/03/31/can-chicago-public-schools-135-million-curriculum-be-a-pandemic-recovery-game-changer\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;district leaders unveiled an optional curriculum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for every subject and every grade and touted that it was designed to be culturally responsive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-af0000\" name=\"image-af0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5e46257/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1d79a0d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b29095b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Alexis Williams and her son&amp;#x27;s father Juanyea Vinson Sr.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b29095b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2bbc8db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b29095b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7941x4457+0+420/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2F44%2F850eeec74d8a84b4975bc3fbc930%2Fblckhistoryportagepark-260211-006.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexis Williams and her son’s father chose Portage Park Elementary because it was their neighborhood school and it seemed like a calm place to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to information on CPS’ website, Portage Park Elementary uses this vetted curriculum for its third through fifth grade social studies lessons. But CPS said the lesson on slavery was not a part of the district’s vetted curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams said before this incident, her son had good experiences at the school he’s attended since preschool. She and her son’s father chose Portage Park because it’s their neighborhood school and it seemed like a calm place in a quiet neighborhood. Williams said the school has been attentive to her son’s peanut and banana allergies and often calls to ask if he’s allowed to eat certain foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams’ son cherishes the theater-focused after-school program where he can pursue his love of singing and dancing and is excelling academically as an honor-roll student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams wants to see the school take some action to avoid other parents going through anything like this in the future. This situation has left her wondering whether the school's broader Black history curriculum is up to snuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just feel like an apology is not enough for this situation,” Williams said. “What are you choosing to teach these kids? And if it's not the right way, then something has to change.”&lt;/p&gt;",

Garbarino, R-New York, began a lengthy committee hearing by calling state and local authorities' refusal to \"protect\" federal law enforcement officers and the deaths of Good and Pretti \"unacceptable and preventable,\" while also voicing support for a \"complete and impartial investigation.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We must take the temperature down and look at the record of enforcement actions through rational eyes,\" Garbarino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also a critique of Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, who led operations in Chicago and in Minneapolis and was demoted after Pretti's killing. U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told the panel —  which also included Rodney Scott, head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services — that Bovino \"escalated the situation\" in Minneapolis.

Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., played a clip of Martinez detailing her wounds after being shot by federal agents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"What happened to Ms. Martinez, Ms. Good and Mr. Pretti is a scourge on this country and shameful chapter in our nation's history,\" Thompson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson also asked the three if they were involved in \"any planning on guarding precincts\" — after Trump suggested Republicans should \"nationalize\" voting. Both Lyons and Scott replied no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Illinois, told the three officials that they have perpetrated \"great evil\" and must answer for their \"lawlessness.\" Then she detailed the shooting of Villegas González, Pretti and Good, and called Martinez's shooting an attempted execution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"DHS cannot be reformed,\" Ramirez said. \"It must be dismantled, and something new must take its place, because if we let DHS persist, it will continue to be a weapon that can be pointed at anyone the government considers the public enemy. And let me tell you, fascism always requires a public enemy.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyons blamed elected officials and protesters for escalating tensions that he said put federal agents in harm's way. He repeatedly declined to publicly comment on the deaths of Pretti and Good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott credited Trump for investing record amounts of money into recruiting, hiring and retaining immigration officers — and he called attacks on federal agents \"coordinated and well-funded.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is not peaceful protest,\" Scott said. \"No law enforcement officers should be put at personal risk simply for doing the job that we have asked them to do.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officials also provided some insight into their enforcement, including that there are \"approximately\" 3,000 ICE agents wearing body cameras, out of about 13,000 in the field. And 10,000 of 20,000 Border Patrol agents are now wearing body cameras. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyons also complained about Democrats referring to ICE as the Gestapo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I have a simple suggestion,\" U.S. Rep. Dan Goldman, D-New York, told him. \"If you don't want to be called a fascist regime or secret police, then stop acting like one.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

He often “restrained or assaulted” the victims to get them to turn over money they were paid in exchange for sex; he was arrested in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams would force one of the women, whom he referred to as “his money,” to take cocaine and other drugs to make her work more, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She later escaped from a hotel where Williams was keeping her, leaving her ID and other belongings behind, according to court documents. When she reached out to Williams to try to get her ID back, he told her he would give it to her if she got in his car. She got in the car as Williams sped away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was going to kill me,” the woman told a loved one who picked her up after she jumped out of the moving vehicle, according to court documents. She was taken to a police station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The harm that he inflicted on [the victims] is likely to reverberate throughout the rest of their lives,\" assistant U.S. attorneys Sushma Raju and Michelle Parthum wrote in the government’s sentencing memorandum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Williams’ crimes were violent, exploitative, and incredibly serious,” the prosecutors wrote in the document.&lt;/p&gt;",

We have seen moments where this nation reached for its better angels, but we are also witnessing, in real time, a dangerous return to the darkest chapters of our racial history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2026/02/06/donald-trump-racist-video-barack-michelle-obama-depiction-primates\"   &gt;viral video&lt;/a&gt; posted by President Donald Trump depicting former President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama as apes is not merely offensive — it is racist to its core, dehumanizing in its intent and dangerous in its impact. This is the same imagery used for centuries to justify slavery, segregation, lynching and the denial of Black humanity. You cannot separate this act from that history. It is soaked in the same old poison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That this occurred during Black History Month makes it even more tragic and revealing. At a time when America should be reflecting on the long road from chains to change, from cotton fields to the Oval Office, we are instead confronted with a reminder that racism is not dead — it is digital, it is viral and it is being amplified from the highest platforms in the land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To blame an unnamed staffer is not leadership — it is cowardice. Leadership requires accountability. Leadership requires repentance. Leadership requires the moral courage to say, “I was wrong.” Silence and deflection only deepen the wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friends, this is not about partisan politics. As &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://leadersnetworkchicago.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;our local-based Leaders Network&lt;/a&gt; continues to say, this is about the soul of America. When a president normalizes racial mockery, he licenses hatred. When he refuses to apologize, he legitimizes bigotry. And when millions watch without consequence, the nation itself becomes complicit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black people are frustrated because we recognize the pattern:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No apology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I remind America of this truth: Progress has never come from the comfort of the powerful — it has always come from the pressure of the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We marched before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We organized before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we will not be silent now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not apes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are not jokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are human beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are children of the most high God!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And no video, no lie, no racist trope — no matter how viral — will ever strip us of our dignity. Mr. President, God is not mocked, and history will record that you used the highest office in the land to traffic in the lowest form of racism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rev.

So far, they’ve chosen the latter. &lt;u&gt;(&lt;/u&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/01/28/pritzker-still-deciding-if-illinois-will-join-federal-program-that-funds-private-school-scholarships\"   &gt;“Pritzker still deciding if Illinois will join federal program that funds private school scholarships,” Sun-Times Jan. 28&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new federal scholarship tax credit offers states a chance to expand educational opportunity at no cost. It requires no state spending and does not reduce public school funding. The governor simply must opt in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the program, taxpayers receive a dollar-for-dollar federal tax credit of up to $1,700 for donations to nonprofit scholarship organizations. Those organizations can support students in public schools, private schools or home schools. Scholarships would be available to families earning up to 300% of their area’s median income and could be used for tutoring, tuition, books, testing fees, dual enrollment courses, special education services and other educational expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/01/28/pritzker-still-deciding-if-illinois-will-join-federal-program-that-funds-private-school-scholarships?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=01292026%20Morning%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_content=01292026%20Morning%20Edition+CID_7790b25307bf0a387c02d4717b8d35ab&amp;amp;utm_source=cst_campaign_monitor&amp;amp;utm_term=Pritzker%20mulls%20if%20Illinois%20will%20join%20federal%20program%20that%20funds%20private%20school%20scholarships&amp;amp;tpcc=cst_cm\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Opposition&lt;/a&gt; to the program is driven largely by special interests and advocacy groups, particularly teachers unions, which have long resisted policies that give families options outside the systems they control. Union leaders have &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.illinoispolicy.org/ift-vows-to-fight-funding-to-help-public-school-kids/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;vowed&lt;/a&gt; to fight the federal scholarships — in part because of their association with the Trump administration — even though the money could very much go to the public schools they serve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But refusing to opt in will not stop Illinois taxpayers from donating. Donors will still receive federal tax credits. The only result will be that scholarship dollars flow to children in other states instead of Illinois students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Student outcomes make the stakes clear. Only about half of Illinois students in grades three through eight read at grade level, and just 39% are proficient in math. Results are even worse for low-income, Black and Hispanic students. The new federal program could help these students access tutoring or cover fees for standardized testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could unlock vast new potential funding sources for booster clubs or educational foundations that serve students. The legal language makes it clear public schools can benefit. But unions don’t want to acknowledge that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is simple: Will state leaders continue to prioritize union demands, or finally put students first?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paul Vallas, adviser, Illinois Policy Institute, Palos Hills&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Minority rule &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t take too much solace from columnist &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2026/02/07/maga-trump-base-polls-republicans-conservatives-mona-charen\"   &gt;Mona Charen’s recent analysis&lt;/a&gt; that only a quarter of the population is full-on MAGA. The American electoral system is so full of quirks that a determined group of roughly 25% of the voters, particularly in favorable geographical configurations, is enough to have elected Donald Trump and cowed otherwise sane Republicans from facing the obvious, indeed inescapable, conclusion that this man is an abomination to the core principles of the rule of law and universal value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn’t just how those 25% behave.

Comfort here does not cancel responsibility there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calm of the lake contrasts painfully with the turbulence endured by my people, reminding me that safety, when unevenly shared, carries an obligation to speak and to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-410000\" name=\"module-410000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Commentary bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commentary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I spoke again with a colleague, a Kurdish academic still in Syria. What he described confirmed what many of us have been seeing online and then some. Beyond the images and posts are deeper, harsher realities: ongoing displacement, targeted abuses and fear intensified by the collapse of protection and t&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/kurdish-collapse-northeast-syria-key-things-watch\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;he steady drying up of humanitarian aid.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are not isolated incidents.

Aid corridors are shrinking. Schools, clinics and basic services are struggling to function. Civilians — especially women, children and older people — are paying the price of decisions made far from their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to remind everyone what is clear: From Chicago, this crisis may feel distant. But it should not be invisible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not a secret that the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/syria/fought-isis-syria-years-now-us-allies-say-abandoned-rcna255348\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;United States has been deeply entangled in Syria’s recent history.&lt;/a&gt; Kurdish communities were critical partners in the fight against the Islamic State group, a fact acknowledged by American officials across administrations. Yet partnership must mean more than words offered in wartime and forgotten in peacetime. Abandonment after sacrifice leaves scars — not only on those left behind, but on the moral credibility of those who turn away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a call for military intervention. It is a call for moral clarity and civic responsibility&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Americans — and as Chicagoans — we understand what it means when communities are treated as disposable, when security is invoked to excuse suffering and when silence becomes a form of consent. Our city’s history teaches us that justice begins when ordinary people insist that distant lives still matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can be done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, humanitarian access must be protected and expanded. Aid should never be politicized or withheld from civilians. Second, U.S. policymakers must use diplomatic leverage to press for civilian protection and accountability for abuses. Third, American civil society — universities, faith communities, human rights groups — must help keep this crisis visible, grounded in facts and human stories, not slogans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I write not only as a Kurd but also as a scholar who believes that knowledge carries responsibility. When suffering becomes normalized, speaking becomes a duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Northern Syria stands at a crossroads. One path leads toward further neglect, radicalization and despair. The other — harder, but necessary — leads toward dignity, humanitarian protection and the recognition that Kurdish lives are not bargaining chips in a regional power game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://goldininstitute.org/2025/09/16/stories-of-migration-chicago/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Chicago is a city built by immigrants, survivors and strivers. &lt;/a&gt;We know that solidarity does not stop at borders. The question is whether we will choose to act on that knowledge — or look away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there is a moral imperative to say this clearly and without hesitation: Kurdish Lives Matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;İbrahim Özdemir, Ph.D.,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;is a Kurdish professor based in Chicago who writes on environmental ethics, environmental justice, human rights, politics and the Middle East. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-070000\" name=\"module-070000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

He has a full head of hair with little graying, no facial wrinkles, and he's fairly fit. I'm 71 and look every day my age, probably older. I have graying hair — lots of it — but I like the color and will never dye it. I am fit, but the deep facial wrinkles and turkey neck emphasize my age. I \"thank\" my husband, a man I've lived with for 40 years, for this. He has given me years of stress and disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My issue: When we are out together, strangers inevitably tell him how shocked or surprised they are at how he \"doesn't look how old he is.\" I'm left sitting right there feeling as if they think I'm his mother. Every time this happens, for days and sometimes weeks, he will spend time staring at himself in the mirror and reminding me how lucky I am to have such a handsome husband. He has always had an ego problem, but it is getting worse. Is there a response to get him to get over himself? — &lt;i&gt;MR. HANDSOME'S WIFE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR WIFE:&lt;/b&gt; It is my observation that people who compulsively stare into mirrors do it not out of ego but because of insecurity. When your husband does this, does he actually TELL you how lucky you are to have such a handsome husband, or is that something you think he is thinking? He is the way his genetics have made him, and the same is true of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel bad about yourself because you think people are making unflattering comparisons between the two of you, consider discussing it with your dermatologist to see if there are some simple procedures that might make you feel better about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My husband is in his 60s. His brother, \"Al,\" (two years younger) has been living in their mother's house for the last 35 years. Before she died seven years ago, she put her house in my husband's name. For all those seven years, Al has been lying to him, promising he's going to move out \"any day now.\" If I try to tell my husband Al may have squatter's rights and is never going to move, my husband becomes verbally abusive and threatens me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that my husband is starting to face the fact that his brother will never move, he has become even more abusive toward me and is trying to drive me out of my own home. He knows I will get half of everything in a divorce because we have been married 31 years. When I suggested mediation, he kicked our dog. We also have loaded weapons in the house. He says he wants a divorce but can't afford one. — &lt;i&gt;UNEASY IN THE EAST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR UNEASY:&lt;/b&gt; You need more help than anyone can give you in a letter. Because your husband's behavior is escalating, you need to get out of there. The next time he becomes violent, instead of kicking the dog, he may hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) and talk with an advocate who can help you escape safely. You should also consult an attorney about how to protect yourself and file a police report about your husband's threatening behavior. He may not be able to afford a divorce, but you can't afford not to get one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Organizers will likely follow suit in 2026, with our bets on Jelly Roll, the genre’s man of the moment. He also headlines Summerfest in Milwaukee on July 4 and has nothing on the calendar after July 28; maybe he’ll bring tourmate Post Malone with him, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saba &lt;/b&gt;(Temp: 82 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;“I really think this might be the year,” said Ciocca about the Chicago-based rapper finally receiving prime-time Lolla treatment in 2026. Saba’s John Walt Day Foundation has routinely worked with the festival on opportunities for young, local up-and-comers and he has played afternoon slots, but his new record “From the Private Collection of Saba and No I.D.” is a total level-up worthy of a bigger stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karol G&lt;/b&gt; (Temp: 80 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;Lollapalooza’s strides to add diversity to the lineup, particularly with Latin music, will continue to be a focus this year — especially just coming off the attention spurred by the Super Bowl. Karol G could be a solid anchor for the fest; not only is she playing Coachella, but “people loved Karol's album last year, and she was just spotted dancing during Bad Bunny's Half-Time Show,” says Ciocca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robyn&lt;/b&gt; (Temp: 78 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;Last year’s Lolla guest spot with Gracie Abrams was just the warmup for the Swedish pop star. Robyn releases “Sexistential” in March, her first new record in nearly a decade, with early singles recalling the fervor of “Dancing On My Own.” Expect her to play all of it at Grant Park this summer while dancing with a lot of company. She just announced a tour stop here for September, but her calendar is wide open in August and we still think Lolla will be part of her itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tame Impala &lt;/b&gt;(Temp: 75 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;After Rüfüs Du Sol’s surprise headline spot last year, Tame Impala could be next to bring electronic vibes to the main stage. The group’s trancey light shows and psychedelic fits were made for festivals, but in Chicago, it hasn’t happened since Lollapalooza 2019 and Pitchfork Music Fest 2018. With their beloved new album “Deadbeat,” now is the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Violet Grohl&lt;/b&gt; (Temp: 73 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;There’s no chance of getting Foo Fighters this year (they play Soldier Field Aug. 8), but Lolla could take a chance on another Grohl — Dave’s daughter, Violet, for her big breakthrough. The young talent just signed with Republic Records and her first singles — “Thum” and “Applefish” — have that total ’90s Lolla &lt;i&gt;je ne sais quoi&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cardi B &lt;/b&gt;(Temp: 70 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;Another big hip-hop contender is Cardi B. “You can’t ignore she was in the news all last year,” said Ciocca, citing the rapper’s livestreamed court trial and her long-awaited sophomore album “Am I The Drama?” that dropped in September. Cardi does play United Center in March but it would seem outside of any Lolla exclusivity and likely may happen before the Lolla lineup is even announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-3e0000\" name=\"image-3e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ed8a66/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4648x2609+0+197/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2Fb1%2F17c9aa264ab78847fa9e49ca226a%2Flolla-072916-022.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31da668/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4648x2609+0+197/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2Fb1%2F17c9aa264ab78847fa9e49ca226a%2Flolla-072916-022.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/22e5780/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4648x2609+0+197/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2Fb1%2F17c9aa264ab78847fa9e49ca226a%2Flolla-072916-022.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The 1975 perform on day one of Lollapalooza in Grant Park on Thursday, July 28, 2016. | Lou Foglia/Sun-Times\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/22e5780/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4648x2609+0+197/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2Fb1%2F17c9aa264ab78847fa9e49ca226a%2Flolla-072916-022.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b9c78a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4648x2609+0+197/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2Fb1%2F17c9aa264ab78847fa9e49ca226a%2Flolla-072916-022.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/22e5780/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4648x2609+0+197/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2Fb1%2F17c9aa264ab78847fa9e49ca226a%2Flolla-072916-022.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1975 perform at Lollapalooza in 2016.

Instead, Lolla could go the solo route with a chart-topper like Rosé (plus, Bruno Mars has a tour break perfectly timed to pop up for “APT”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-480000\" name=\"image-480000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d270304/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4797x2692+0+254/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F39%2F8d61667f4c33a82e757138073a26%2Flolladay4-080425-115.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de9e86b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4797x2692+0+254/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F39%2F8d61667f4c33a82e757138073a26%2Flolladay4-080425-115.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4cd7d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4797x2692+0+254/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F39%2F8d61667f4c33a82e757138073a26%2Flolladay4-080425-115.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A$AP Rocky performs at the Bud Light stage during day four of Lollapalooza on Sunday, August 3, 2025. | Candace Dane Chambers /Sun-Times\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4cd7d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4797x2692+0+254/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F39%2F8d61667f4c33a82e757138073a26%2Flolladay4-080425-115.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/459bcea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4797x2692+0+254/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F39%2F8d61667f4c33a82e757138073a26%2Flolladay4-080425-115.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4cd7d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4797x2692+0+254/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F39%2F8d61667f4c33a82e757138073a26%2Flolladay4-080425-115.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A$AP Rocky performs at the Bud Light stage last year.

Lolla could give him a do-over this year now that the rapper’s long-overdue “Don’t Be Dumb” album finally came out in January. It also features composer Danny Elfman, which would make for a killer collab. But A$AP does have a United Center show in May, so it could be a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lana Del Rey &lt;/b&gt;(Temp: 42 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;Del Rey’s new country-tinged album “Stove” is due any day now (at least, it’s been teased that way for a while). If she can get it together in time, Lolla would be a great mass introduction to the new material. But so would Stagecoach, so she may hold off until 2027 for a proper festival appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lady Gaga&lt;/b&gt; (Temp: 40 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;It’s been a minute since Gaga headlined Lollapalooza, and she is still staging the Mayhem Ball in American cities through April. But the pop star is always one to reinvent and quickly move on to her next phase, so August could be too late to keep up the gothic opera façade. Even so, seeing her next-level production at Grant Park would be worth the admission alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pearl Jam&lt;/b&gt; (Temp: 38 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;The Seattle rock vets have a long history with Lollapalooza, from dominating the festival’s infamous 1992 touring caravan to returning in 2007 and playing international iterations like Brazil in the years since. They could use the platform to introduce their as-yet-unknown new drummer, but without new music since 2024, it’s a big “Wishlist” item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harry Styles&lt;/b&gt; (Temp: 35 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;We could have a better shot at a One Direction reunion than seeing Styles play Lolla at this point in his career, but hear us out. With his extensive Mexico City and Madison Square Garden residencies coming up, there’s a big void of other North American dates in 2026, and he does have July 30 and Aug. 2 open. But Ciocca is more of a “Belieber” that the male pop star slot would go to Justin Bieber after he takes on Coachella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-970000\" name=\"image-970000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a4024b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3243x1820+0+171/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F40%2F968600d448a3aa90de5bca868c69%2Flolla-073016-09.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ad0bd51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3243x1820+0+171/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F40%2F968600d448a3aa90de5bca868c69%2Flolla-073016-09.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f7437c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3243x1820+0+171/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F40%2F968600d448a3aa90de5bca868c69%2Flolla-073016-09.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Radiohead performs on day two of Lollapalooza in Grant Park, Friday night, July 29, 2016. | Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f7437c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3243x1820+0+171/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F40%2F968600d448a3aa90de5bca868c69%2Flolla-073016-09.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3af8f06/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3243x1820+0+171/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F40%2F968600d448a3aa90de5bca868c69%2Flolla-073016-09.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f7437c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3243x1820+0+171/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F40%2F968600d448a3aa90de5bca868c69%2Flolla-073016-09.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thom Yorke of Radiohead performs at Lollapalooza in 2016. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Radiohead &lt;/b&gt;(Temp: 30 Degrees)&lt;br&gt;It may be a chillier prediction, but we’re riding on the rumors that Radiohead may finally tour the U.S. this year and hoping on a wish and a prayer that those plans include Lollapalooza.

Washington Heights holds Walter H. Dyett High School for the Arts, named after the famed violinist and music educator. And in Bronzeville, an area that was known as Chicago’s “Black Belt” during the Great Migration starting around 1916, there’s Paul Laurence Dunbar Vocational Career Academy, named after the famed poet and playwright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this wasn’t always the case. Many of the district’s older schools are named after white men: George Washington High School serving Hegewisch and South Deering on the far East Side, Edgar Allan Poe Classical School in Pullman and Theodore Roosevelt High School in Albany Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, what was the first public school in Chicago named in honor of a Black person?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer takes us back to 1936, when Chicago had just built its first high school to serve an exclusively Black student population, according to articles in the Chicago Defender.

By the late 1770s, he was living in what is currently Chicago with his Potawatomi wife, Kitahawa. Today, we know him as the “father of Chicago,” and his name is one we can see on monuments, even driving on Lake Shore Drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the 1930s were a much different landscape, and it took two concurrent movements to ignite this change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think there are two stories here happening at the same time,” said Elizabeth Todd-Breland, associate professor of history at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “One is about the increasing knowledge of DuSable as an important figure of African descent during the 20th century.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other story has to do with the proposal to build the high school itself. The naming came with some controversy — the expected pushback from white residents, but also resistance from some in the school community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A boom in young, Black migrants&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wendell Phillips High School opened in the early 1900s to replace the South Division High School — the first high school on Chicago’s South Side, built in 1875. This new school was named after an abolitionist and advocate for the rights of Native Americans. In &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://archive.org/details/eulogyonwendellp00grim\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;his eulogy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Black lawyer George Lewis Ruffin said Phillips was \"the one White American wholly color-blind and free from race prejudice.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, wealthy white Chicagoans enrolled at Wendell Phillips, but with the Great Migration, the school’s demographics drastically changed. In 1907, 90 Black students attended Wendell Phillips, yet by 1919, Todd-Breland said, the school had become predominantly Black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the late 1920s, it would become overpopulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-fc0000\" name=\"image-fc0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/36d394a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+342/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F49%2F56fd47964afb9839308b4c8d205d%2Fi019126-pm.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9acabbf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+342/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F49%2F56fd47964afb9839308b4c8d205d%2Fi019126-pm.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24103ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+342/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F49%2F56fd47964afb9839308b4c8d205d%2Fi019126-pm.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Wendell Phillips High School\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24103ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+342/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F49%2F56fd47964afb9839308b4c8d205d%2Fi019126-pm.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/02b476b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+342/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F49%2F56fd47964afb9839308b4c8d205d%2Fi019126-pm.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24103ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+342/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2F49%2F56fd47964afb9839308b4c8d205d%2Fi019126-pm.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exterior view of Wendell Phillips High School, located at 244 East Pershing Road, Chicago, Illinios, circa 1904.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barnes-Crosby Company/Chicago History Museum, ICHi-019126; Barnes-Crosby Company, photographer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is bringing an influx of people into Chicago, and that included a lot of young people,” Todd-Breland said. “A lot of the migrants, or young people that would be born here, would be the children of migrants in that early part of the 20th century. And so, there was not enough capacity in existing schools.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black Chicagoans pushed for a new school, which was to be called New Wendell Phillips. New Deal Public Works Administration funds from the federal government helped push along the construction of the new building, and it opened in 1935. At first, the original building was converted to an elementary school. But once school officials realized the new school couldn’t fit all students, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/zlup/Historic_Preservation/Publications/Wendell_Phillips_High_School.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;it reopened&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a high school later in the 1930s. That 1875 structure still operates as a high school today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recognizing Chicago’s ‘first citizen’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1930s, prominent people pushed for a heightened knowledge of DuSable and an acknowledgement of his role as the city’s first citizen. Todd-Breland said the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/worlds-fair-exhibit-championed-black-chicago-32190327/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;National De Saible Memorial Society&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, led by educator Annie Oliver, advocated for a replica of DuSable’s cabin to be featured in the 1933 World’s Fair, which still &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/curious-city/2024/02/09/black-chicago-history-the-1940-american-negro-exposition\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;lacked Black representation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; decades after the Columbian Exposition in 1893.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-be0000\" name=\"image-be0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ad149df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+123/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fe6%2F0a76e8434c188aa62968cd6ae80c%2Fst70005638-0001.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d3766b3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+123/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fe6%2F0a76e8434c188aa62968cd6ae80c%2Fst70005638-0001.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a6d788/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+123/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fe6%2F0a76e8434c188aa62968cd6ae80c%2Fst70005638-0001.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Robert Taylor housing project\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a6d788/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+123/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fe6%2F0a76e8434c188aa62968cd6ae80c%2Fst70005638-0001.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/43ea357/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+123/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fe6%2F0a76e8434c188aa62968cd6ae80c%2Fst70005638-0001.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a6d788/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+123/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fe6%2F0a76e8434c188aa62968cd6ae80c%2Fst70005638-0001.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exterior of DuSable High School in 1966.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Sun-Times/ST-70005638-0001, Chicago Sun-Times collection, Chicago History Museum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The society’s advocacy was both significant and controversial. White settlers such as John Kinzie and others who lived at the Fort Dearborn outpost in the early 1800s were considered by many white people as Chicago’s first settlers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of white folks did not like this,” Todd-Breland said. “Because this contradicted a narrative of white settlers as being the first permanent residents of the area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A win for advocates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newspaper articles at the time reported Oliver and her group were also behind successfully changing New Wendell Phillips to DuSable High School. A June 1936 article in the New Journal and Guide confirms this influence: “Many who protested the change declared that DuSable was a Frenchman and not a Negro and that records differ as to his being Chicago’s first settler.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to little knowledge about DuSable, some Black people also wanted to keep the Wendell Phillips name, which by this point was a source of pride. Phillips had become the home of so many Black people who were building a new legacy at the school; their school spirit and sports wins even included cultivating players on the Savoy Big Five, the team that would become the Harlem Globetrotters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-090000\" name=\"image-090000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cd766ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5583x3133+0+666/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F26%2Fa9%2Fac6dfcc74c55a1480a527438ff88%2Fadn-0000172-pm.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b65c9a5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5583x3133+0+666/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F26%2Fa9%2Fac6dfcc74c55a1480a527438ff88%2Fadn-0000172-pm.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/458e561/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5583x3133+0+666/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F26%2Fa9%2Fac6dfcc74c55a1480a527438ff88%2Fadn-0000172-pm.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Victorious DuSable High School Basketball Team carrying Coach Jim Brown\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/458e561/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5583x3133+0+666/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F26%2Fa9%2Fac6dfcc74c55a1480a527438ff88%2Fadn-0000172-pm.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a97c65f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5583x3133+0+666/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F26%2Fa9%2Fac6dfcc74c55a1480a527438ff88%2Fadn-0000172-pm.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/458e561/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5583x3133+0+666/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F26%2Fa9%2Fac6dfcc74c55a1480a527438ff88%2Fadn-0000172-pm.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victorious DuSable High School Basketball Team carrying Coach Jim Brown to the locker room after they defeated Lakeview High School, Chicago, Illinois, March 12, 1954. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Daily News, Inc./ADN-0000172, Chicago Daily News/Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago History Museum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The history and legacy of Wendell Phillips High School was really important to Black Chicago,” Todd-Breland said. “But I do think what was significant about DuSable High School is that while Wendell Phillips was built in the early 1900s and originally served predominantly white students, DuSable was this first high school built specifically to serve Black students. And so, it was a point of pride outside of what the name of it was going to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black people advocating for — and then getting — a new, modern school with amenities felt like a big move toward equality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Things like labs, facilities for electrical work, mechanical drawing, auto shop, woodwork; it had a library, a pool, rehearsal rooms for choral and instrumental music. All of these things that were part of an idea of what a modern school should have … these were things that were being built for Black folks,” Todd-Breland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c10000\" name=\"image-c10000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f259ab3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F32%2Faf0374a84541a0a62eb52bdd9673%2Fdusable-high-school.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d2c2f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F32%2Faf0374a84541a0a62eb52bdd9673%2Fdusable-high-school.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bcea7f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F32%2Faf0374a84541a0a62eb52bdd9673%2Fdusable-high-school.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"DuSable High School\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bcea7f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F32%2Faf0374a84541a0a62eb52bdd9673%2Fdusable-high-school.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/86e88e0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F32%2Faf0374a84541a0a62eb52bdd9673%2Fdusable-high-school.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bcea7f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2F32%2Faf0374a84541a0a62eb52bdd9673%2Fdusable-high-school.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jamboree program at DuSable High School in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Sun Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a facility that felt equal to or maybe even superior to some of the white high schools in Chicago at the time was an extra point of pride for Black Chicagoans who fought for it, Todd-Breland said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a time of segregation, and most of the advocacy for Black folks in Chicago around education during this period, it wasn’t really about desegregation,” she explained. “It was about funding equalization, and it was about educational equality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A lasting legacy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, DuSable High School was known for its renowned arts program and its booming 4,000-student population. But in the early 2000s, enrollment dropped significantly with the closure of a nearby public housing complex. DuSable was first reorganized into three separate schools operating in the building.

Returners Chelsea Gray and Kahleah Copper lead the Rose in scoring, but they're still only 5-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little more Reese could be just what the Rose needs. It could be just what the league needs, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Unrivaled recently set the attendance record for women’s pro basketball with a tour stop in Philadelphia, TV ratings have been muted. A splashy midseason addition could help generate some buzz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You entertain people, that’s why they get their butts in the seats to come and watch you,” Weatherspoon told Reese on her podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unrivaled's biggest names were hit by injuries this season, with Sabrina Ionescu, Napheesa Collier and Satou Sabally all having to sit out. The league created a development pool for younger players to train and replace injured players when necessary, but signing Reese adds more star power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reese has had a busy WNBA offseason with podcasting, fashion, business ventures and acting. She recently got a role on the Netflix show \"The Hunting Wives.\" She also &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2025/12/12/from-usa-basketball-camp-sky-star-angel-reese-quiets-fears-about-a-departure-from-chicago\"   &gt;attended a training camp&lt;/a&gt; for Team USA in December as the team evaluates players for the 2026 FIBA World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Reese said she missed Unrivaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I miss the development,” she said on her podcast. “I can try stuff, I can do whatever, and I can take it and implement it to the W.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Unrivaled’s inaugural season, Rose won the championship and Reese was named Defensive Player of the Year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This season, playoffs begin on February 28, with the championship set for March 4.&lt;/p&gt;",

Five gunshots are then heard off camera.&amp;nbsp;As the footage continues, another agent climbs out of the vehicle, points his weapon and yells, \"Don’t you f---ing move.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DHS discrepancy&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;The footage seems to undermine the initial&amp;nbsp;claim by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that Martinez and another man \"rammed\" the Tahoe driven by Exum, which also carried two other agents.

Jason Friedman, Rory Hoskins, Anabel Mendoza, Jazmin Robinson, Reed Showalter and Felix Tello are running for the Democratic nomination to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Danny Davis in the 7th Congressional District, which stretches from the South Side to the western suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;GOP candidates&lt;/b&gt;: The GOP primary includes Chad Koppie and Patricia \"P Rae\" Easley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hot seat&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Davis has held the seat for nearly three decades, and the primary winner in this heavily Democratic district will be

Four years later, he scraped money together to buy his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now — after 31 years, 49 oil changes, 56 spark plugs and 11 sets of tires — his car is on display as part of the Chi-Town Alley exhibit at the 2026 show, which kicked off Saturday and runs through Monday at McCormick Place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new attraction this year, Chi-Town Alley, also features a variety of vehicles owned by local enthusiasts. Also on display is a row of gleaming Mustangs and tricked-out lowriders from car clubs in the region. The exhibit was created to encourage community-building and celebrate Chicago’s car scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auto show also features the usual popular attractions, including kid-friendly activities, off-roading vehicles, and indoor and outdoor test tracks. Last Saturday, attendees lined up to pet dogs that were part of an adoption initiative hosted by Subaru. They also participated in a meet and greet with \"Fast &amp;amp; Furious\" actor Sung Kang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Chicago is awesome because it’s very diverse,\" Kang said. \"There’s such a mixture of different ethnic groups. The car culture is not just one color. Everyone came together to celebrate this common love of cars.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wykqdl-l-jd/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;YOUR DAILY QUESTION ☕️&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, we asked you: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wykqdl-l-jk/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Should Chicagoans be empowered to use their phones to record parking violations in crosswalks and bus and bike lanes?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s some of what you said, edited for space and clarity:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Citizens should unequivocally have the power to record parking violations by commercial vehicles — especially rideshare vehicles. CPD does not have the personnel or funds to record the hundreds of violations that occur every day, causing traffic hassles and threats to pedestrian and vehicular safety. Concurrently, citizens should also have the authority to record cyclists and pedestrians who do the same. Bikers and people on scooters often skip through stop signs, creating stop-short situations with cars and pedestrians, particularly e-bikers who think that sidewalks were made for them.\" — &lt;i&gt;Marla Forbes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"No, I don’t think people should be recording these violations. It’s already difficult to find temporary parking near stores when someone just needs to run in for a quick pickup. Turning every resident into an enforcement agent doesn’t solve that problem and could create more tension than it resolves. If the city truly wants to improve safety — and create another meaningful revenue stream — it should invest in stop sign cameras. As a runner, I can’t emphasize enough how often drivers treat stop signs as 'yield signs' or ignore them altogether.\" — &lt;i&gt;Tony Fiore&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"While I am concerned about the over-reliance on surveillance technology in this day and age, I do think it's a good idea to let citizens flag parking violations. Being a pedestrian or cyclist in Chicago — or any other large city for that matter — is so dangerous that anything that can be done to ameliorate that is beneficial.\" —&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Ethan Flanagan&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"No way should we be allowing or encouraging this form of vigilante enforcement. I spent several years as a truck driver doing deliveries. In many parts of the city the only way to get that done is pulling to the curb and often there are parked cars ... I do support making things safer for bikes and pedestrians but this is not the way. It takes their rights and negates the ability of people to get their jobs done. It will eventually impact consumers when deliveries become impossible.\" — &lt;i&gt;Stu Smith&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading the Sun-Times&amp;nbsp;Morning Edition!&lt;br&gt;Got a story you think we missed?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:newsletters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Email us here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written and curated by&lt;/b&gt;: Matt Moore&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor&lt;/b&gt;: Eydie Cubarrubia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Sun-Times is a nonprofit supported by&amp;nbsp;readers like you.

The United States already clinched a berth by winning the 2025 FIBA Women’s AmeriCup, and several national team stars — including A’ja Wilson and Breanna Stewart — are not competing in San Juan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 2024 Olympic gold medal team, only Diana Taurasi has retired, meaning there aren’t many open spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, making the qualifying roster is a meaningful step toward the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reese is among a wave of newcomers making their senior national team debuts, alongside Caitlin Clark, Paige Bueckers, Sonia Citron and Kiki Iriafen, a group Bueckers calls the “Young and Turnt Crew.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ll join 2024 Olympic gold medalists Kahleah Copper, Chelsea Gray, Kelsey Plum and Jackie Young in San Juan for the qualifiers, along with Aliyah Boston, Rhyne Howard and Dearica Hamby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group was part of a 17-player mini camp in Durham in December that also included two college standouts (Lauren Betts and Juju Watkins).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I haven't done USA since I was in college, so to be back here to potentially be on the senior national team is really, really important to me,\" Reese said during the camp. \"I've dreamed of playing for the Olympics and especially for L.A. because I want to represent this country well.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team will be led by Duke head coach Kara Lawson and assisted by WNBA coaches Natalie Nakase (Golden State Valkyries), Nate Tibbetts (Phoenix Mercury) and Stephanie White (Indiana Fever). Lawson will return to Duke before the tournament concludes to prepare for the NCAA Tournament, with an assistant stepping into the lead role for the remaining games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. begins play March 11 against Senegal, followed by Puerto Rico (March 12), Italy (March 14), New Zealand (March 15) and Spain (March 17).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;USA Basketball managing director Sue Bird selected the roster and will continue evaluating players ahead of final selections for the World Cup.

Al preguntarle si estaba abierto a la posibilidad de “eliminar” esa parte de su decreto ejecutivo, el alcalde dijo esencialmente que no había necesidad de sacarla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“El decreto ejecutivo no da ninguna especificación sobre si debo jugar un papel en determinar si un caso debe ser referido o enjuiciado. El decreto ejecutivo aclara cómo el departamento de policía lleva a cabo sus esfuerzos para poder determinar, y luego decidir, como en cualquier otro caso, si debe avanzar,” dijo el alcalde durante su conferencia de prensa semanal en el Ayuntamiento.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“La dirección es para el Departamento de Policía, no para la fiscal del estado... Eso está dentro de mi autoridad. Yo dirijo al Departamento de Policía todo el tiempo... Proporcionar dirección, eso está dentro de mi autoridad. No se limita solo al departamento de policía. Doy dirección como el ejecutivo principal de esta ciudad sobre una variedad de temas”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esa dirección tuvo que ser codificada, dijo Johnson, para asegurar que no haya “ambigüedad sobre cómo el Departamento de Policía puede actuar cuando está en el lugar y si están presenciando comportamiento abusivo”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aunque O’Neill Burke parece haber descartado acatar el decreto ejecutivo, Johnson mantiene la esperanza de que puede usar el proceso de elaboración de reglas de 30 días para, como él lo expresó, “proporcionar claridad sobre el lenguaje” que ultimadamente creará “un camino hacia la responsabilidad, un camino hacia la justicia”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Esa es nuestra estrella polar en este momento: Asegurarnos de que este gobierno rebelde, temerario y detestable, que está siendo llevado a cabo por extremistas de derecha en este país, sea finalmente llamado a responder porque en este momento eso no está pasando. Por eso estoy dispuesto a usar cualquier herramienta”, aseguró el alcalde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Esto ni siquiera se trata de política para mí. Se trata de salvar vidas y proteger al pueblo de Chicago. Se trata de establecer un precedente para que el resto del país lo adopte. Eso es lo que este momento requiere: un liderazgo real, audaz y tenaz que esté preparado y dispuesto a enfrentar a un tirano”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Durante meses, los vecindarios de Chicago han soportado la campaña de deportación Operativo Midway Blitz de la administración de Trump. Pero la indignación aquí y en todo el país estalló cuando agentes federales dispararon fatalmente a Renee Good y Alex Pretti en Minneapolis, sólo meses después de que Silverio Villegas Gonzalez fue asesinado por un agente del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) en el vecindario de Franklin Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El martes, Johnson dijo que la campaña de deportación y la represión orquestada por Trump ha sido “uno de los actos más perturbadores de violencia por parte del gobierno que hemos visto en una generación”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cuando tienes a un padre que deja a sus hijos en la escuela y después es asesinado y el gobierno federal miente al respecto, tenemos que responsabilizar a esos individuos”, dijo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A una mujer le dispararon cinco veces en la ciudad de Chicago. Ellos presentan cargos contra ella, [solo] para luego retirarlos, porque también mintieron al respecto. Asaltando complejos de apartamentos a medianoche en el lado sur de Chicago. Poniendo a un hombre negro en una llave de estrangulación que era ilegal, eso es una sentencia de muerte.

He appeared in just 28 games in 2025, limited by an oblique injury in late May and a sprained ankle in mid-August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was strengthening everything, not just that area,” Amaya said Tuesday of his offseason. “I was strengthening my entire body, preparing myself. It's going to be a great year here with the Cubs. We’ve got a good squad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amaya is one of three returning Cubs players who was sidelined by injury going into last year’s playoffs, along with Justin Steele (elbow surgery) and Cade Horton (fractured rib).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Amaya and Horton had relatively normal offseasons – Amaya said by early December he was feeling “100% good to go,” and Horton said he took just a week off after the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/10/11/cubs-2025-postseason-runs-with-game-5-loss-to-brewers-in-nld\"   &gt;Cubs’ NLDS exit&lt;/a&gt;. Steele has been throwing off a mound since mid-January and is on track to return early in the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, the season began [Monday],” Amaya said. “And my mentality is, I want to win every single game this year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs’ catching unit was at its strongest when Amaya was healthy and splitting time with veteran Carson Kelly, the setup keeping both fresh. Amaya posted a career-best .814 OPS last year. And Kelly was putting up MVP-like numbers early in the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No matter who's playing, if it's Carson or if it's myself, we're going to do damage,” Amaya said. “We're going to help our team, we're going to take care of our pitchers. And that's what we were doing in the beginning of the season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the Cubs would have a similar setup for much of the 2026 season, with Ballesteros also mixing in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs' pitching staff enters spring training mostly healthy. Right-hander Trent Thornton, a non-roster invitee, is behind after tearing his Achilles last August. But other than him and Steele, general manager Carter Hawkins said, the Cubs are \"in a good place.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three Cubs players were delayed by visa issues, manager Craig Counsell said Wednesday. Right-handed pitcher Javier Assad and catchers Moisés Ballesteros and Christian Bethancourt (non-roster invitee) did not arrive before the first official workout, but they were “all expected shortly,” Counsell said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The pair lived on the second floor of a building without an elevator, which meant Cooper often had to call a private ambulance company or the Chicago Fire Department to help Talbert get to and from her frequent medical appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooper requested an emergency move in 2020 to an accessible CHA apartment, but found many units didn’t fit her family’s needs or she was told the family didn’t meet the requirements for the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talbert died just over two years later, with the family still living in the second-floor unit, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooper declined an interview request through her attorney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Records show the CHA violated federal disability laws and the civil rights of residents like Talbert for at least eight years — leading to negotiations for a voluntary compliance agreement between the CHA and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court records show the CHA paid Cooper $525,000 last year to settle a 2023 lawsuit that accused the agency of failing “to provide her and her late daughter, Trebora Talbert, with reasonable alternative housing conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not the first instance of the CHA neglecting its legal requirements to accommodate residents with disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a senior manager of compliance at the housing authority is now sounding the alarm, again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Black, brown, and elderly CHA residents languished and died, their names sitting on a de facto waiting list for nearly a decade before their much needed and deserved reasonable accommodations were ever made available,” whistleblower Amanda Motyka wrote in her complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint, viewed by the Chicago Sun-Times, was sent last week to the agency’s operating chairman, board, members of senior leadership and filed with the CHA’s inspector general and HUD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motyka wrote that she submitted her letter to “shine a light on the dysfunction of CHA’s handling of public housing’s reasonable accommodations,” and three senior leaders were “complicit in the denial and violation of hundreds of CHA residents’ civil rights.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was met with “a fabricated Performance Improvement Plan, a hostile work environment, and retaliation,” when she brought these issues to the attention of her supervisors in the property and asset management division, including Interim Chief Property Officer Leonard Langston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The housing authority rescinded the performance improvement plan three days after she filed the complaint, an email obtained by the Sun-Times shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/11/15/cha-residents-frustrated-housing-agency-permanent-ceo\"   &gt;CHA residents grow frustrated as agency marks one year without permanent CEO&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The CHA declined an interview request. Matthew Brewer, the agency’s board chair and interim operating chairman, didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHA spokesperson Matthew Aguilar said in a statement that the agency is taking the complaint “very seriously,” having escalated it to its ethics officer and the Office of the Inspector General for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He confirmed Motyka’s continued employment at the CHA and said they “remain in active dialogue to understand and address the complaint as necessary.” He declined to comment further on personnel matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The housing authority also decided to transition the accessibility team — which reviews reasonable accommodations requests and oversees unit accessibility and compliance — from the property and asset management department to the resident services department, effective immediately, Aguilar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It launched a Reasonable Accommodations Task Force to “conduct a top-to-bottom review of our past practices, compared against best practices, to ensure we are improving the quality, consistency, and transparency of our services going forward,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUD declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor’s office didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motyka’s complaint has been forwarded to HUD’s Office of the Inspector General, according to a HUD source who wasn’t authorized to speak on the record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Longstanding disability violations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, CHA residents filed a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/news/2018/07/16/cha-seniors-file-complaint-over-missing-grab-bars\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;federal complaint&lt;/a&gt; against the housing authority saying the agency had failed to install grab bars in their public housing units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While grab bars were installed for many residents soon after the complaint was filed, Emily Coffey, attorney for the complainants, said the intention with continuing to pursue the complaint was to reform the CHA more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal is to get CHA back to a place where they are approving reasonable accommodations and complying with disability law as a matter of course, rather than the status that we are still in where residents face a real uphill battle into getting reasonable accommodations met,” Coffey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the complaint, HUD launched its own investigation and found in 2022 that the CHA had “removed accessibility features during a renovation … relocated Complainant to a unit without the accessibility features present in their previous unit … failed to install the accessibility feature for Complainant after their request for a reasonable accommodation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal agency also initiated a comprehensive investigation into the housing authority’s overall compliance with disability and civil rights laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said the CHA was in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, records obtained by the Sun-Times show. Section 504 is a part of the federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in programs that receive federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The housing authority agreed to settle its issues through a compliance agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CHA and HUD have been negotiating a voluntary compliance agreement for years to resolve the issues related to the 2018 complaint and broader disability discrimination issues, according to public records and sources involved in the negotiations. The agency was previously under a compliance agreement from 2006 to 2013 for Section 504 and ADA violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former HUD official involved in the investigations said negotiations were initially slow because CHA’s in-house attorneys “stalled.” The source spoke on the condition of anonymity given the ongoing negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CHA said it has been “consistently engaged and responsive” to HUD since it agreed to a voluntary compliance agreement in 2023. Aguilar said the CHA moved forward with the agreement “in the spirit of creating long-term sustainability and transparency around its Reasonable Accommodations process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A draft of the agreement, reviewed by the Sun-Times, said the CHA must address its unlawful deficiencies through actions including:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-711b8b22-0773-11f1-8706-e1913bd3c4b8\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;hiring a “disability rights coordinator”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;retain a “neutral accessibility consultant” to survey the disability-related needs of existing residents and the accessibility of housing units&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;create an accessibility plan outlining how the agency will come into compliance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;update its reasonable accommodation policy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;maintain a policy for disability-related grievances, including investigating and responding to all grievances within 30 days after they're received&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;annual disability-related training for staff&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement would become effective for 10 years once approved by the regional director of HUD’s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, records show. The agreement could be terminated early, or extended, depending on the CHA’s adherence to HUD’s demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiations over the agreement stalled due to staffing changes at HUD, but an email, obtained by the Sun-Times, from Elizabeth Silas, CHA’s interim general counsel, said talks have picked back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December, Silas wrote in her email to senior agency leaders that a new HUD investigator hoped to have updated drafts of their agreement by the end of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CHA, which has been &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/11/15/cha-residents-frustrated-housing-agency-permanent-ceo\"   &gt;without a permanent CEO&lt;/a&gt; for over a year, confirmed it provided feedback to HUD on the draft agreement in 2024 and hasn’t received an updated version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Motyka, residents speak out&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sun-Times reported last year that CHA residents are frustrated, saying property conditions remain dire, including for disabled residents who say their accessibility needs aren’t being met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents with disabilities make up about 35% of the housing authority’s 135,000 clients, agency records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motyka told the Sun-Times that 35% is likely an undercount because of residents’ disinclination to report disabilities, due to the housing authority’s negligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CHA acknowledged in a statement that disability data “across housing systems nationwide is inherently limited by voluntary self-reporting” and said residents are not required to disclose a disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motyka rejoined the CHA in June 2025, after working for years on disability and civil rights compliance at the Federal Emergency Management Agency and HUD. She previously worked at the CHA from 2004 to 2015 in the accessibility office, when it was under the first voluntary compliance agreement with HUD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the division has been mismanaged for years and the CHA was warned by HUD that staffing levels were inappropriate given the housing authority’s size. The CHA is the third-largest public housing authority in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one year ago, the housing authority launched a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/02/27/cha-year-of-renewal-staff-changes/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“year of renewal”&lt;/a&gt; and Aguilar, of the CHA, said it included expanding its reasonable accommodations team with two more full-time employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CHA is “committed to strengthening our reasonable accommodation process,” Aguilar said in a statement. “When the process does not work as intended, it creates real barriers for residents seeking support, and we must do better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motyka said her goal with her letter is to have the accessibility department “moved to a place of prominence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People need to know what is happening,” Motyka said in an interview. “It is a right and duty as a civil servant to be a voice for residents who are basically voiceless at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/02/06/chicago-housing-authority-contracts-commissioner-debra-parker-daughter-lovie-diggs\"   &gt;Chicago Housing Authority backs off ban on contracts with commissioner’s daughter&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/10/10/chicago-housing-authority-debra-parker-cha-contracts-investigation\"   &gt;CHA has paid $22 million to companies tied to board member&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/12/15/chicago-housing-authority-hud-oig-audit-immigration-criminal-activity\"   &gt;Chicago Housing Authority subject of HUD audit citing immigration and criminal activity, records show&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

He arrived this week at Camelback Ranch as the most obvious early choice to start on Opening Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the All-Star game as a rookie will do that for a guy, especially on a developing squad that still lacks a clear-cut ace. Not that Smith’s thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m just thinking about Friday,” Smith said, looking ahead only to his next bullpen session scheduled for later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not so much for Smith’s teammate Davis Martin, a friend &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2025/09/26/davis-martin-white-sox-rotation-mentor-shane-smith\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;and mentor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — and competitor — who’s already got an eye on the March 26 season-opener at Milwaukee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I already told Shane, ‘I know you're the favorite by a long shot, but you'd be remiss to think that all the other starters are just going to hand it to you,’” Martin said. “So he knows he's in for a fight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most observers would agree with Martin’s Opening Day odds-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith led the Sox in his inaugural campaign with 145 strikeouts and 146 ⅓ innings pitched behind a 96-mph fastball and knee-buckling and changeup, en route to a 7-8 record over 29 starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With those numbers on the books, his second spring training comes with a little less stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You're not fighting for your life every time you touch the ball. That’s a little different,” Smith said. “But I think the approach of what I want to do to hitters is still the same.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Jonathan Cannon, Sean Burke and Shane Smith throwing bullpens. &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/suntimes_sports?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;@suntimes_sports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/EZ0ErqOyWK\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EZ0ErqOyWK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Mitchell Armentrout (@mitchtrout) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/mitchtrout/status/2021284069775114607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 10, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Boston-area native spent much of the offseason focusing on “making the mechanics as consistent as possible.” That could help him avoid the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2025/08/30/white-sox-shane-smith-pitching-future-rotation-yankees-all-star\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;midseason slump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he hit before his scoreless third of an inning &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2025/07/06/shane-smith-all-star-white-sox-rule-5-rookie\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;during the All-Star game&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the Sox’ sole representative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to see if I can get my slider to be a more reusable pitch this year. Got away from it, but want to see what it looks like this year, and if I can make an adjustment on it, it'll be great,” said Smith, who turns 26 in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And just like Martin was to him, the second-year starter says he’s trying to serve as a role model “of what you want the rotation to look like, and be a good example for the guys that want to be on it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, Martin and Anthony Kay — &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2025/12/09/anthony-kay-regained-his-confidence-overseas-white-sox-hope-he-can-translate-that-success-to-the-majors\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;freshly signed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from an impressive stint in Japan — seem to be the only locks for the Sox’ starting rotation, at least before any of the inevitable bumps and bruises that come with spring training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sean Burke and Jonathan Cannon were both in the mix for last year’s Opening Day start, but they find themselves fighting for rotation spots after an up-and-down 2025 that saw both of them &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2025/08/18/sean-burke-demoted-triple-a-white-sox-starters\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;demoted to Triple-A Charlotte&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s nothing new for a close-knit pitching staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the day, that's all we're doing — we're competitors,” said Martin, who posted a 4.10 ERA in 25 starts last season, his first full campaign with the Sox after recovering from Tommy John surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We love competing against each other and wherever that ends up, we're gonna be happy for those people. But then the in-season competition starts,” he said. “There will be some verbal sparring for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Venable demurred as any manager would when asked about his Opening Day starter on the second day of camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Venable said Smith “looks great” a year removed from his breakout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a guy who came into camp last year as a Rule 5 guy, not an easy thing to do, and you saw how quickly he embraced that and performed at a really high level,” Venable said. “This year he's got that under his belt, he doesn't have the pressure of being a Rule 5 guy — I'm not sure that it really impacted him at all anyway. If anything, it helped him.”&lt;/p&gt;",

Garbarino, republicano por Nueva York, comenzó una larga audiencia del comité al calificar de “inaceptable y prevenible” la negativa de las autoridades estatales y locales a “proteger” a los agentes de la ley federal y a las muertes de Good y Pretti, al mismo tiempo que expresaba su apoyo a una “investigación completa e imparcial”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-7f0000\" name=\"module-7f0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Debemos calmar las tensiones y mirar el historial de acciones de aplicación de la ley con ojos racionales”, dijo Garbarino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;También hubo una crítica al comandante de la Patrulla Fronteriza, Gregory Bovino, quien lideró operativos en Chicago y Minneapolis y fue degradado tras la muerte de Pretti. El representante Michael McCaul, republicano por Texas, le dijo al panel —que también incluía a Rodney Scott, jefe de la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza y a Joseph Edlow, director de Servicios de Ciudadanía e Inmigración— que Bovino “escaló la situación” en Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;También elogió los esfuerzos del “zar de la frontera”, Tom Homan, quien fue enviado a Minneapolis para desescalar la situación. McCaul también les dijo a los funcionarios que sus agentes “no están entrenados para controlar multitudes de manera efectiva” y sugirió que “las patrullas itinerantes deberían realizarse en la frontera en lugar de en las ciudades principales de Estados Unidos”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La audiencia incluyó referencias a tiroteos locales, incluida la muerte de Silverio Villegas González, a quien un un agente federal de inmigración le disparó a “quemarropa” en Franklin Park mientras supuestamente intentaba huir de una parada de tráfico en septiembre, y Marimar Martínez, a quien &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2026/02/04/marimar-martinez-baleada-por-agentes-de-migracion-se-pronuncia-contra-asesinatos\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;un agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza le disparó cinco veces en Chicago&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La representante Bennie Thompson, demócrata por Minnesota, mostró un video de Martínez detallando sus heridas. “Lo que le ocurrió a la Srta. Martínez, a la Sra. Good y al Sr. Pretti es una desgracia para este país y un capítulo vergonzoso en la historia de nuestra nación”, dijo Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson también preguntó a los tres si estaban involucrados en “alguna planificación para proteger los distritos electorales” —después de que Trump sugiriera que los republicanos deberían “nacionalizar” la votación. Ambos, Lyons y Scott, respondieron que no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La representante Delia Ramírez, demócrata por Illinois, les dijo a los tres funcionarios que habían perpetrado “un gran mal” y debían responder por su “anarquía”. Luego detalló los tiroteos de Villegas González, Pretti y Good y calificó el tiroteo de Martínez como un intento de ejecución.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DHS no puede ser reformado”, aseguró Ramírez. “Debe ser desmantelado y algo nuevo debe ocupar su lugar, porque si permitimos que DHS persista, continuará siendo un arma que puede apuntarse a cualquier persona que el gobierno considere enemigo público. Y déjenme decirles, el fascismo siempre requiere un enemigo público”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyons culpó a los funcionarios electos y a los manifestantes por escalar las tensiones que, según él, pusieron en peligro a los agentes federales. Se negó repetidamente a comentar públicamente sobre las muertes de Pretti y Good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott atribuyó a Trump la inversión de cifras récord en reclutar, contratar y retener agentes de inmigración y calificó los ataques a los agentes federales como “coordinados y bien financiados”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Esto no es una protesta pacífica”, dijo Scott. “Ningún oficial de la ley debería correr riesgos personales simplemente por hacer el trabajo que les hemos pedido que hagan”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los funcionarios también proporcionaron información sobre su aplicación de la ley, indicando que hay “aproximadamente” 3,000 agentes de ICE usando cámaras corporales, de unos 13,000 que están activos. Y 10,000 de 20,000 agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza ahora están usando cámaras corporales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyons también se quejó de que los demócratas se refieren a ICE como la Gestapo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tengo una sugerencia simple”, le dijo el representante Dan Goldman, demócrata por Nueva York. “Si no desean ser llamados un régimen fascista o una policía secreta, entonces dejen de actuar como tal”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

But the merger failed to generate real improvement in sales and profitability, according to Morningstar analyst Erin Lash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following decade, the company suffered from shifting consumer tastes toward &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2025/12/06/chicago-companies-mush-farmers-fridge-consumers-processed-foods\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;health-conscious foods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and away from processed foods that populate the brand’s portfolio, like Velveeta Cheese and Oscar Mayer lunch meats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also failed to invest in its wide-reaching legacy brands, according to Cahillane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is clear that we have historically underinvested in our brands and in the business, resulting in persistent share loss over the last decade,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company announced in September that it would be splitting into &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/09/02/kraft-heinz-split-separate-companies\"   &gt;two publicly-traded companies&lt;/a&gt;, with the separation wrapping up in the second half of 2026. The plan was to split its faster-growing sauces, spreads and seasonings brands, like Heinz and Kraft Mac &amp;amp; Cheese, from its legacy brands such as Oscar Mayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, it will remain as one company with a focus on returning the business to growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the company plans to launch a new type of Kraft Mac &amp;amp; Cheese, called PowerMac, later this year that will have 17 grams of protein and six grams of fiber, Cahillane said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The $600 million, I think, gives us a lot of confidence that we've got what it takes,” he said. “With half of that being against the brands and showing up for consumers with the right opening price points, the right promotional opportunities and the right brand marketing against what are really iconic and wonderful brands that I've already said do respond to investment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also emphasized plans to adjust its pricing to better meet shoppers' budgets. \"We believe we can get back to price points that are more friendly to consumers, and we can do that pretty quickly,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That'll be essential for its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program customers. \"SNAP is obviously a headwind in consumer goods because the consumer that's under the most pressure is having money removed from their household budget,\" Cahillane said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said about 13% of its U.S. retail business comes from SNAP, compared to 11% for the overall industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kraft Heinz reported revenue dropping 3.4% to $6.4 billion in the three months ended Dec. 27. For 2025, revenue was $24.9 billion, down 3.5% year over year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2025/12/06/chicago-companies-mush-farmers-fridge-consumers-processed-foods\"   &gt;Chicago food companies like Mush, Farmer’s Fridge flourish as consumers move away from processed foods&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/work/2025/12/16/kraft-heinz-ceo-cahillane-kellanova-chicago\"   &gt;Kraft Heinz gets new CEO with longtime Chicago ties&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/consumer-affairs/2025/12/02/san-francisco-sues-chicago-food-kraft-heinz-mondelez-ultra-processed\"   &gt;San Francisco sues Chicago food giants over ultra-processed products&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Lin-Manuel Miranda subbed for him on stage. “Thank you to every single person here,” Van Der Beek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A onetime theater kid, Van Der Beek also starred on TV in “CSI: Cyber” as FBI Special Agent Elijah Mundo, but he was forever connected to “Dawson’s Creek,” which ran from 1998 to 2003 on The WB. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The series followed a high school group of friends as they fell in and out of love, formed friendships and ound their footing in life. Van Der Beek, than 20, played 15-year-old Dawson Leery, who aspired to be a director of Steven Spielberg quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dawson’s Creek,” with Paula Cole’s “I Don’t Want To Wait” as its moody theme song, helped define The WB as a haven for teenagers and young adults who related to its hyperarticulate dialogue and frank talk about sexuality. It made household names of Van Der Beek, Joshua Jackson, Katie Holmes and Michelle Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show caused a stir when Jackson's character embarked on a racy affair with a teacher 20 years his senior and when Holmes’ character would climb through Dawson’s bedroom window and curl up together in bed with him. Racier shows like “Euphoria” and “Sex Education” owe a debt to “Dawson’s Creek.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Der Beek sometimes struggled to get out from under the shadow of the show but eventually leaned into lampooning himself, like on Funny Or Die videos and on Kesha’s “Blow” music video, which included his laser-gun battle with the pop star in a nightclub and dead unicorns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s tough to compete with something that was the cultural phenomenon that ‘Dawson’s Creek’ was,” he said in an interview with Vulture in 2013. “It ran for so long. That’s a lot of hours playing one character in front of people. So it’s natural that they associate you with that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Der Beek is survived by his wife Kimberly and six children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment-and-culture/2024/11/04/james-van-der-beek-colon-cancer-diagnosis\"   &gt;James Van Der Beek reveals colon cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/well/2021/5/19/22443672/colon-cancer-colorectal-screening-chadwick-boseman-federal-health-guidelines-kimmie-ng\"   &gt;Get screened earlier for colon cancer, at 45, not 50, new federal health guidelines urge&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/9/4/21420233/chadwick-boseman-colon-cancer-colorectal-screening-colonoscopy-sonia-kupfer-abigail-silva-salina-lee\"   &gt;Like ‘Black Panther’ star Chadwick Boseman, more under 50 are getting colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

La agencia se ha negado a retractarse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El 4 de octubre, Martínez siguió a la Tahoe manejada por Exum, tocó su claxon, gritó “la migra” y trató de advertirle a las personas sobre los agentes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contó que paró su Rogue a un lado de la Tahoe cerca de 39th Street y Kedzie Avenue, donde afirmó que Exum giró su Tahoe hacia su Rogue y sus vehículos se rozaron entre sí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martínez dijo que detuvo su Rogue pero temía ser agredida por los agentes, así que se alejó. Agregó que manejó hacia la izquierda, para evitar a los agentes que salían de su vehículo por su derecha. Pero al pasar, dijo que Exum abrió fuego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Se detuvo en un taller de reparación, fue llevada a un hospital y eventualmente bajo custodia federal.

The drawing depicts three vehicles ahead of the agents' Chevrolet Tahoe, in addition to Martinez's Nissan Rogue and a GMC Envoy driven by another man who faced criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video shows the three cars depicted ahead of the Border Patrol Tahoe \"don't exist,\" attorney Christopher Parente said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-040000\" name=\"image-040000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/34846f1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/612x343+0+233/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2Fa8%2F27f031b440118f7f8b16ea811849%2Ffbimain-001-000034.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04a254a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/612x343+0+233/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2Fa8%2F27f031b440118f7f8b16ea811849%2Ffbimain-001-000034.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/20e46ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/612x343+0+233/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2Fa8%2F27f031b440118f7f8b16ea811849%2Ffbimain-001-000034.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"FBIMAIN_001-000034.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/20e46ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/612x343+0+233/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2Fa8%2F27f031b440118f7f8b16ea811849%2Ffbimain-001-000034.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c032e61/2147483647/strip/true/crop/612x343+0+233/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2Fa8%2F27f031b440118f7f8b16ea811849%2Ffbimain-001-000034.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/20e46ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/612x343+0+233/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2Fa8%2F27f031b440118f7f8b16ea811849%2Ffbimain-001-000034.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A diagram drawn by federal agents of the scene of the Oct. 4 shooting of Marimar Martinez in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"They drew those cars to justify a bad shooting,\" he insisted during a press conference in the Loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is a time when we just cannot trust the words of our federal officials,\" Parente added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attorney also disputed claims by Border Patrol agent Charles Exum that Exum fired all five shots at Martinez through her front windshield.

Five gunshots are then heard off-camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the footage continues, another agent climbs out of the vehicle, points his weapon and yells “don’t you f—king move” as he appears to secure the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/03/marimar-martinez-shot-border-patrol-chicago-speaks-out-after-good-pretti-deaths-i-am-their-voice\"   &gt;Marimar Martinez, shot by Border Patrol in Chicago, speaks out after Good, Pretti deaths: ‘I am their voice’&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The footage seemed to undermine the initial Homeland Security claim that Martinez and another man “rammed” the Tahoe driven by Exum that also carried the two additional agents.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;It also appears to support Martinez’s claim that Exum swerved his Tahoe in her direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In text messages after the shooting, Exum wrote that his superiors had been supportive, making references to U.S. Border Patrol Cmdr.

She honked her horn, yelled “la migra” and tried to warn people about the agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she pulled her Rogue beside the Tahoe near 39th and Kedzie, where she said Exum swerved toward her Rogue and their vehicles swiped each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez said she stopped her Rogue but feared being “manhandled” by the agents, so she drove away. She said she drove to her “farthest left,” to avoid the agents climbing out of their vehicle on her right. But as she passed, she said Exum opened fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She pulled over at a repair shop, was taken to a hospital and eventually into federal custody.

But, we recognize these are unique times and we’re committed to ensuring the work gets done.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to a budget rebellion not seen since the 1980s power struggle known as Council Wars, Johnson and his finance team warned repeatedly that the newly revised revenue plan included shaky and unrealistic estimates that would set Chicago up for a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/01/07/mayor-brandon-johnson-mid-year-layoffs-chicago\"   &gt;midyear budget shortfall.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson’s administration took particular aim at the plan to sell off long-term city debt to collection agencies and saturate the city with video gambling terminals — with the assumption that 80% of the 3,300 eligible establishments with off-premises liquor licenses would apply, and would also get gaming licenses this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the two months since the budget battle ended, Johnson has given the rebel group more reason for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor has made only the first half of a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/01/21/chicago-city-council-pension-advance-half-payment-mayor-brandon-johnson\"   &gt;$260 million advance pension payment&lt;/a&gt; while vowing to pay the second half when a cash flow crunch eases. And he said he is “bracing for what could be mid-year layoffs” that may include “workers attached to community safety” when revenues fall short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Johnson has yet to provide the official notification to the state needed to allow the Il. Gaming Board to start licensing video gambling terminals in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerned that Johnson is buying time to try and repeal the portion of the budget that lifted the Chicago ban on video gambling, Ald. Anthony Beale (9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;) and his colleagues went around the mayor and sent that notification to the Gaming Board this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Johnson spoke to City Club of Chicago and gave every indication that he is prepared to continue the budget battle he lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor once again denounced the proposed sale of city debt as “wicked and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/12/23/mayor-brandon-johnson-city-council-alternate-budget\"   &gt;immoral&lt;/a&gt;” and continued to beat the drum for progressive revenue that includes tax on millionaires, digital advertising and a graduated income tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is not to say that middle-class and working-class folks will not pay our fair share. We're simply saying that others have to step up, man up, woman up, person up to do the very same thing because it's a matter of saving lives,\" the mayor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The fact that it's working is proof positive that, if we invest in people, we can save lives and transform communities. The fight for the revenue that we need to invest in our community is at the core of this struggle.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, Johnson offered to declare for re-election on the spot if only every member of his audience of movers and shakers would agree to join him in lobbying the Il. General Assembly for progressive revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combative and defiant tone that Johnson struck sounded like a continuation of the budget battle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Johnson administration does all it can to implement the budget, Nugent said there should be no need for layoffs. But, she fears the mayor could be playing a game of, \"I told you so.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I'm not willing to wait around for that excuse,\" she said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Macaroons are chewy jumbles of coconut bound together with egg whites and sweetened condensed milk. You may find the condensed milk to be cloyingly sweet, but it's key to yielding a juicy, soft interior without any dryness — which distinguishes a great macaroon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These macaroons are crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, with a chocolate-dipped base for a little Valentine's Day bling. The recipe takes inspiration from an Ina Garten recipe, with a few tweaks. It switches out half of the sweetened coconut with unsweetened coconut, which helps to offset some of the sweetness, and adds a whiff of almond extract for extra dimension. Most important, it includes a generous dunk in bittersweet chocolate, which has a magnificent grounding effect on, well, everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chocolate-Dipped Coconut Macaroons&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Active Time:&lt;/b&gt; 20 minutes&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Total Time:&lt;/b&gt; 45 minutes&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yield:&lt;/b&gt; Makes about 24&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk&lt;br&gt;7 ounces sweetened shredded coconut&lt;br&gt;7 ounces unsweetened shredded coconut&lt;br&gt;1 teaspoon vanilla extract&lt;br&gt;1/4 teaspoon almond extract&lt;br&gt;2 large egg whites, room temperature&lt;br&gt;1/4 teaspoon kosher salt&lt;br&gt;7 ounces dark (70%) chocolate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat the oven to 325 degrees. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combine the milk, coconut, vanilla and almond extract in a large bowl and stir to blend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beat the egg whites and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Gently fold into the coconut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drop heaping tablespoon-sized mounds of coconut, about 1 1/2 inches apart, on the baking sheets. Bake on the two center racks in the oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating the baking sheets to ensure even baking. Remove and cool completely on a wire rack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the cookies are baking, melt the chocolate in a double boiler over simmering water over low heat, stirring until smooth.

We've all been there, and this recipe is the remedy to any buyer's remorse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a bit of slow cooking, those impossibly pert, shiny tomatoes relax and soften, releasing their juices to mingle in a deeply satisfying dish. A supporting cast of bold ingredients rounds out the mix. In this skillet dinner, spiced sausage, tender broccolini spears and piquant cheese join forces with the tomatoes. For a midwinter pasta dish, it doesn't get brighter — or more satisfying — than this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All you need is a little time to pan-roast the tomatoes, about 10 minutes in total. As they cook, the tomatoes morph into squidgy versions of themselves, concentrating their sugars and flavor while releasing liquid that melds into the pan juices. To speed the softening process, start by making a small incision in each tomato with a paring knife. As they cook, use a wooden spoon to gently press them, coaxing out their juices, which combine with the sausage drippings to form a light, spicy sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Skillet Pasta With Roasted Tomatoes, Sausage and Broccolini&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Active time:&lt;/b&gt; 35 minutes&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Total time:&lt;/b&gt; 35 minutes&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Special equipment:&lt;/b&gt; large cast-iron skillet&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yield:&lt;/b&gt; Serves 4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ingredients&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 ounces grape tomatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 tablespoon olive oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 to 12 ounces hot Italian sausages or chorizo, sliced 1/2 inch thick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8 ounces broccolini, ends trimmed, cut in 1 1/2-inch pieces&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 garlic cloves, minced&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 teaspoon kosher salt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 ounces penne&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1/3 cup packed finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, plus extra for sprinkling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1/4 cup basil leaves, roughly torn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freshly ground black pepper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pierce the tomatoes with the tip of a paring knife. Transfer to a bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sausages in one layer, in batches if necessary. Brown on both sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from the skillet. Add the tomatoes and cook until they begin to collapse and release their juices, about 10 minutes, stirring and gently pressing occasionally with a wooden spoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the broccolini and stir until bright in color and crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic, red pepper flakes and salt. Stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds more. Remove the skillet from the heat while you cook the pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the penne and cook until al dente, according to package instructions. Drain the penne, reserving about 1/2 cup cooking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the penne to the skillet and stir to combine. If the pasta is dry, add a few tablespoons of the reserved water. Stir in the cheese and basil. Divide between serving plates and serve with additional grated cheese for sprinkling.

He then spiked a football painted with the English words “Together, we are America.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local academics say his message was clear: The Puerto Rican musician was reframing what it means to be an “American” beyond just the 50 states of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most Americans, when we talk about the U.S., we call it America as if the U.S. is the only nation that’s America, but for people in Latin America and the Caribbean, América refers to the entire hemisphere,” said Lilia Fernández, a history professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernández says Bad Bunny’s unifying message likely &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/music/2026/02/08/humboldt-park-benito-bowl-bad-bunny-superbowl\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;resonated with many in Chicago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who themselves are from the countries or territories he named or are descendents of relatives who were born there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A WBEZ analysis of census data from the most recent American Community Survey estimates finds roughly 1 in every 8 Chicagoans was born outside of the 50 U.S. states but in one of the countries or territories that make up the Western Hemisphere spanning from South to Central to North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexico is by far the most common place of origin for Chicagoans born outside of the 50 U.S. states, followed by Puerto Rico, Ecuador, Guatemala and Venezuela, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the number of Chicagoans who identify as the children or grandchildren of people born in those places is likely much larger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-3a0000\" name=\"html-embed-module-3a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27595327\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27595327/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad Bunny’s closing message builds on a centuries-old critique of the United States as the sole “America,” said Mérida M. Rúa, a Latino and Latina studies professor at Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rúa says artists like Latin musician and politician Rubén Blades, in his 1984 album “Buscando América,” have explicitly called out the idea of America as a continent. Hundreds of years before Blades, the pan-American vision of Simón Bolívar, who led the charge against Spanish colonial rule in South America, was carried on by scholars like Cuban poet José Martí in his 1891 essay “Nuestra América.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Bad Bunny is the latest in a long lineage of people who have reframed the meaning of “America,” he’s the first to do it on a stage as large as the NFL Super Bowl halftime show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also a powerful statement to make in the current political environment, said Fernández. Just last month, U.S. military forces &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/nation-world/2026/01/03/chicago-venezuelans-applaud-maduro-ouster-trump-attack-motives\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the Trump administration continues its immigration enforcement campaigns across the country. On Sunday, President Donald Trump called the Super Bowl halftime show “absolutely terrible” and “an affront to the Greatness of America” in a post on Truth Social.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seemed to be a message of inclusion and an alternative vision to the politics we're seeing right now in the United States, particularly from coming out of the White House and supporters of the president and his enforcement policies,” Fernández said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/music/2026/02/08/humboldt-park-benito-bowl-bad-bunny-superbowl\"   &gt;Joy fills Humboldt Park during ‘Benito Bowl’ halftime show watch party: ‘It’s a good day to be Puerto Rican’&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports-media/2026/02/10/super-bowl-lx-averages-124-9-million-viewers-bad-bunny-gets-128-2-million-for-halftime-show\"   &gt;Super Bowl LX most-watched program in NBC history; Bad Bunny gets 128.2 million viewers&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/music/2026/02/09/bad-bunny-superbowl-halftime-chicago-conductor-giancarlo-guerrero-lady-gaga-ricky-martin-music\"   &gt;Bad Bunny taps Chicago conductor to lead surprise orchestra in Super Bowl halftime show&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/09/12/immigrant-population-chicago-ice-immigration-enforcement-trump\"   &gt;A portrait of immigrants in Chicago: Immigrant population reaches its highest point in nearly two decades&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

It seems more like, ‘let's get to work’ exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe some of the change in atmosphere could be attributed to the sunshine, or the World Baseball Classic participant’s early ramp-up, or the additions to the spring training facilities — including an expansion of the main building and a new stand-alone hitting and pitching lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taillon wasn’t the only one, however, who tied that specific kind of excitement to the way 2025 ended for the Cubs. They snapped a four-year playoff drought and forced a Game 5 in the National League Division Series against the Brewers, only to fall a couple runs short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So many of the guys were here last year, and I think they feel like we had a really good season, but there's unfinished business,” Cubs president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer said Wednesday. “And I think that in a lot of ways, that's the best kind of spring training, when there's a hunger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs had to remake their bullpen this offseason and lost right fielder Kyle Tucker to free agency. But otherwise, the roster remained largely intact. The Cubs’ additions, including the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/01/15/cubs-tout-alex-bregmans-leadership-as-they-enter-long-term-commitment\"   &gt;signing of veteran third baseman Alex Bregman&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/01/16/why-cubs-saw-edward-cabrera-answer-long-quest-starting-pitching-jed-hoyer-tommy-hottovy\"   &gt;trade for starting pitcher Edward Cabrera&lt;/a&gt;, raised their ceiling — and outside expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PECOTA Projections have the Cubs as the runaway favorites to win the division, although the Brewers’ habit of far exceeding preseason projections should be noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everybody in this industry wants expectations,” manager Craig Counsell said. “You work hard to get expectations. … You work really hard to build a roster that has expectations, work really hard to get on a team that has expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What exactly are the expectations internally?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For left-hander Matthew Boyd, that’s an easy question.  The answer hasn’t changed since last year: win the World Series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We came up short,” Boyd said of last season. “It was a lot of fun. It was awesome. We're grateful for it. Wouldn't trade it for anything. But ultimately, we didn't really go where we wanted to go. It doesn't mean it was a failure, it just means we didn't get there yet. So our goal is to do it this year, and we’ve got the right guys to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the Cubs snatch the NL Central title from the Brewers, who have won the division for the last three years straight, they’ll have to get through the juggernaut Dodgers to make it to the World Series. The back-to-back champions continued to strengthen their roster this offseason, notably adding Tucker and closer Edwin Diaz, in pursuit of a three-peat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the improvement to the Cubs' roster, the path to a World Series victory has some formidable road blocks for them. But their postseason aspirations are more solid now, in contrast to the years after the 2021 teardown, when their stated goal to “compete” felt nebulous and purposely broad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They saw their NLDS exit last year as a disappointment, and anything but a deeper postseason run this year would be just as disheartening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s cool to return so many guys,” Taillon said. “We know where we were last year, and know how bad that hurt. And it's also exciting to add new guys with playoff history, new guys who come here and now expect to win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not a place now where guys are coming to necessarily just hope they can steal some playing time. … We have a good reputation on the coaching side and the development side, but I also think guys come here now expecting to win, which is a cool shift to see and feel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, title=Latest on the Cubs, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, items=[{type=Image, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, timestamp=1770830827000, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, title=Cubs catcher Miguel Amaya poised for bounce-back after injury-riddled 2025, isFeatured=false, anchorId=promo-e60000, wordCount=553, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/maddie-lee, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, name=[{items=[Maddie Lee]}], _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[], media=[], jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Cubs reporter]}]}], target=null, primaryMediaType=null, ampLink=null, media=[{ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/47/74/a64fd450405bbb8d4af3ff8e71db/miguel-amaya.jpg, width=7928, height=5290}, alt=Cubs catcher Miguel Amaya is carted off the field with an injury during the eighth inning of a game against against the Blue Jays in Toronto on Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2025., image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/47/74/a64fd450405bbb8d4af3ff8e71db/miguel-amaya.jpg, width=7928, height=5290}}], url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/11/cubs-catcher-miguel-amaya-poised-for-bounce-back-after-injury-riddled-2025, description=[{items=[The Cubs held their first spring training official workout for pitchers and catchers on Wednesday.]}], audio=[], audioDuration=null, publishDate=February 11, 2026 11:27 AM, _template=/page/promo/PagePromo.hbs, category=[{items=[Cubs]}]}, {timestamp=1770741020000, type=Image, category=[{items=[Art]}], _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/art, isFeatured=false, wordCount=1096, target=null, title=The Art Institute of Chicago just hung its first Norman Rockwell, and it depicts the Cubs, primaryMediaType=null, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/art/2026/02/10/art-institute-chicago-norman-rockwell-cubs-painting, anchorId=promo-e60001, ampLink=null, publishDate=February 10, 2026 10:30 AM, authors=[{name=[{items=[Courtney Kueppers | WBEZ]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[], jobTitle=[{items=[Arts and culture reporter]}], media=[{narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/87/82/df1cdaee5053f96413c949c44089/profile-image-800-0.jpg, width=512, height=512}, alt=profile-image-800-0.jpg, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/87/82/df1cdaee5053f96413c949c44089/profile-image-800-0.jpg, width=512, height=512}}], authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/courtney-kueppers}], description=[{items=[“The Dugout,” a famed piece of American art, is a gift to the museum from the private collection of former Illinois Gov.

She heard gunshots after getting out of the driver's seat and hid under another vehicle, from where she could see her husband lying motionless on the ground, she testified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2025/11/04/trial-of-man-accused-in-2020-fatal-shooting-of-two-men-in-chinatown-gets-underway\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Trial of man accused in 2020 fatal shooting of two men in Chinatown gets underway&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2020/2/11/21133388/chinatown-huayi-bian-weizhong-xiong-alvin-thomas-shooting-murder\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;‘It’s just wrong,’ friend of 2 men murdered in Chinatown says after suspect charged&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the time of the shooting, police said Thomas had demanded money and, while Yang complied, Bian and Xiong refused and were shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the sentencing, Yang spoke to reporters through a Chinese interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Exactly six years and two days after such a long wait, finally, justice is served, and the defendant deserves two life term sentences,\" she told CBS2 through the interpreter. \"And finally, I can tell my late husband somewhere up there that we did it and, finally, we got justice.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas had been held in jail since his arrest on the day of the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;",

Gregory Bovino, calling him a “potential” danger to the community despite the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a bond hearing Wednesday, Judge Matthew Beese said lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security presented “substantial” evidence from the criminal trial to support their claim that he posed a danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors in that trial failed to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, a jury found. But Beese emphasized that his decision was based on immigration court standards, which differ from those in criminal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homeland Security lawyers spent a significant portion of the hearing presenting evidence that had either been rejected by jurors during the criminal trial, or barred by the judge who oversaw it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers on Wednesday cited a Homeland Security Investigations report that included phone records alleging Espinoza Martinez, 37, was affiliated with the Latin Kings and had access to firearms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also pointed to a Snapchat message Espinoza Martinez sent in early October that followed a photo of Bovino. The message read, “2k on info cuando lo agarren,” “10k if u take him down,” and “LK … on him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bovino served as the face of Operation Midway Blitz, the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation campaign in the Chicago area last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors in the criminal case did not set out to prove Espinoza Martinez’s affiliation with the Latin Kings. Without that claim, U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/01/15/federal-judge-bars-gang-evidence-from-bovino-murder-for-hire-trial\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;barred gang-related evidence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from his trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Espinoza Martinez has been in federal custody for more than four months since his arrest on murder-for-hire charges in early October, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury acquitted Espinoza Martinez on Jan. 22 after a brief trial at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse. He was &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/01/24/juan-espinoza-martinez-bovino-murder-plot-ice-custody\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;quickly taken into the custody&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homeland Security officials have accused Espinoza Martinez of being in the country illegally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sussethe Renteria, an immigration attorney representing Espinoza Martinez, said he entered the country at age 5 and Chicago was “the only home he knows.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renteria rejected claims that Espinoza Martinez posed a danger to the community or a flight risk, saying Homeland Security was “attempting to relitigate the criminal case” despite his acquittal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said Espinoza Martinez had no criminal record aside from minor traffic violations and denied that he had any involvement with a gang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we respect the court's decision, we are disappointed with the outcome,” Renteria said after the hearing. “He has the unwavering support of his community and his family, and has three children and a wife desperate for him to come home. We are confident that justice will be served.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renteria said she was considering appealing the court’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the hearing, Renteria also presented a statement from Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd) stating that Espinoza Martinez, who lives in the Little Village neighborhood, had “no connection to gang activity.” She stressed that merely living in a neighborhood with gang presence does not make someone a gang member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, a federal judge in Indiana &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/04/federal-judge-orders-trump-administration-not-to-deport-chicago-man-cleared-of-bovino-murder-plot\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;temporarily blocked&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration from deporting Espinoza Marinez who was being held in the Clay County Justice Center in Brazil, Indiana. His attorney, Michael Adler, filed a petition Feb. 2 in the Southern District of Indiana challenging his detention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge ordered the Trump administration not to move Espinoza Martinez “outside the jurisdiction of the United States,” or outside the 7th U.S. Circuit — which includes Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin — while the litigation proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A removal hearing was scheduled for Feb. 25. Renteria said she would file a request to cancel the removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contributing: Jon Seidel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Seeing their excitement and seeing guys like [starter &lt;b&gt;Jonathan&lt;/b&gt;] &lt;b&gt;Cannon&lt;/b&gt; and [catcher &lt;b&gt;Korey&lt;/b&gt;] &lt;b&gt;Lee&lt;/b&gt; — threw to Lee today — it was like old times,” Fedde said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a new era of competence that general manager &lt;b&gt;Chris Getz&lt;/b&gt; is aiming to help usher in with Fedde, who turns 33 later this month and whose veteran presence should help fill out a young rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Sox took a step forward in 2025 around a budding core of infield talent, Fedde has mostly struggled since Getz dealt him at ‘24 trade deadline, when he arguably was the lowly team’s best player with a 3.11 ERA over 21 starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Fedde went 4-13 with a 5.49 ERA during stints with St. Louis, Atlanta and Milwaukee, where he showed late-season improvement out of the bullpen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;New arrivals to Camelback Ranch (and one returning).

Just a few things to work on in catch everyday and try to, brick-by-brick, get back to being good,” said Fedde. “They know what I look like when I’m at my best.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manager &lt;b&gt;Will Venable&lt;/b&gt; praised Fedde’s ability, “but also as an example to these young guys about how to go about their business and build the things on a daily basis that can lead to long-term success.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fedde said his style is similar to Cannon’s, “so it’s fun to pick each other’s brains and we can be each other’s test dummies and pass from one to the other on what’s working and what’s not.” But there will be other younger guys looking up to him, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s crazy. You blink and you go from the young guy to the old guy really quick,” Fedde said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prelander’s long road back&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right-hander &lt;b&gt;Prelander Berroa&lt;/b&gt; threw off a mound for the third time Tuesday in his recovery from Tommy John surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berroa, 25, showed flame-throwing promise during a brief stint with the Sox in 2024, when he struck out 29 batters across 20⅔ innings with a 3.05 ERA. He figured to play a key bullpen role last year &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2025/03/10/wait-till-next-year-white-sox-prelander-berroa-latest-to-face-tommy-john-surgery\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;before his elbow gave out&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in spring training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my mind, there's no doubt that that's the level I'm going to get back once I start pitching in the majors again,” said Berroa, who has shared his Tommy John journey with lefty &lt;b&gt;Ky Bush&lt;/b&gt;, who was similarly sidelined in ‘25.

They accounted for about $1.1 million of his $1.8 million in receipts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman also raised six-figure sums from restaurant and health care sectors, the review found. Nursing home and senior housing interests contributed another $128,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the crowded primary race headed into its home stretch, Friedman had more than $1 million in cash on hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/07/30/danny-davis-wont-seek-reelection-congress\"   &gt;U.S. Rep. Danny K. Davis&lt;/a&gt;, who has held the 7th District seat since 1997, announced his retirement last summer and endorsed state Rep. La Shawn K. Ford (D-Chicago), one of seven Black candidates in the primary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford accused Friedman of amassing funds from large donors “to take advantage of…too many Black people being in the race and, ‘I’ll sneak in.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district has had Black representation in Congress for the past 53 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He has never been a partner in this fight [for] people on the West Side,” Ford said of a low-income swath of the district, which also includes near-western suburbs as well as some Downtown and South Side neighborhoods. “I think he’s been all about the fight [to] make as much money as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman’s father, Albert, founded a massive real-estate firm with deep ties to several mayoral administrations and was known as the “mayor of River North.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Friedman, the candidate, said his fundraising figures reflect “a strong desire to have a doer, someone who’s willing to stand up to fight, someone who’s willing to say that career politicians aren’t working for us anymore and aren’t fighting for us anymore, and that Jason Friedman is a person who can get something done and deliver for this community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-f80000\" name=\"html-embed-module-f80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27561960\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27561960/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the start of 2026, Friedman had raised nearly three times as much as the race’s next most prolific fundraiser, Thomas Fisher, a University of Chicago Medical Center physician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisher’s nearly $627,000 in contributions include $2,500 from William Daley, brother of former Mayor Richard M. Daley and a former chief of staff to President Barack Obama. Another $1,000 came from Diana Rauner, wife of former Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. Singer John Legend made contributions totaling $5,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fisher’s campaign had about $455,000 cash on hand by the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think that my success in fundraising is a reflection of folks with an appetite for newness,” Fisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford raised some $407,000 for his campaign last year. His own money accounts for about a quarter of that. He entered January with more than $307,000 on hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin raised more than $336,000 for her federal campaign last year and had nearly $217,000 on hand. But she has a state campaign war chest, almost twice as big, at her disposal to boost her profile in the congressional district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conyears-Ervin has also received federal support from Chicago real estate magnate Elzie Higginbottom and Alex Pissios, the former owner of Cinespace studios, who served as a government mole to bring down one of the city’s most powerful labor bosses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conyears-Ervin is also benefiting from a reported ad buy from the United Democracy Project, a pro-Israel super PAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Cook County Commissioner Richard Boykin has raised more than $328,000 for his campaign and had about $105,000 on hand to start this year. Chicago businessman Willie Wilson gave $3,500, the maximum individual contribution for one cycle, primary or general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sizable hauls were also reported by former Federal Trade Commission attorney Reed Showalter ($253,569), Services Employees International Union-backed police accountability official Anthony Driver Jr. ($175 651), Forest Park Mayor Rory Hoskins ($160,607) and immigrant rights organizer Anabel Mendoza ($128,645).&lt;/p&gt;",

A percentage of non-football revenue would then be used to pay off the stadium. Weisbach, who called into a press conference, called it the “financing plan of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shovels could be in the ground as soon as June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/10/iowa-bears-really-state-looks-to-lure-nfl-team-with-stadium-funding-pitch\"   &gt;Iowa Bears?

Weisbach said he looked forward to meeting with Bears president/CEO Kevin Warren and Indiana Gov. Mike Braun about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears declined comment, though, just as they have when asked about other Northwest Indiana sites — both in Hammond and Gary. The Portage site along the Burns Waterway is the furthest away of the three. Bonta touted the ability to reach the stadium site via cars, trains and boats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears own 326 acres in Arlington Heights but want the ability to negotiate property tax rates and public funding for infrastructure. Frustrated with a lack of progress, they announced in December they’d consider building in Indiana, which created Senate Bill 27 to establish a stadium authority to finance a stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portage’s pitch might have come too late —Indiana’s legislative session ends Feb. 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portage was the second municipality to pitch the Bears in as many days.

Vazquez,  the alleged carjacker being chased by police for 11 miles at  speeds as high as 95 mph, is the one who should be held responsible, they claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rejection by a 18-15 vote was the latest sign that an emboldened City Council fed up with the avalanche of settlements tied to allegations of police wrongdoing is no longer willing to rubber-stamp those giant payouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They took a stand against the settlement to the family of Flores Gomez even as they signed off on a combined, $29.2 million payout to four men who were framed for murders they did not commit by now-retired Chicago Police detective Reynaldo Guevara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no debate about and no opposition to any of the Guevara-related settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of debate, however, about the Flores Gomez settlement in spite of the heartbreaking consequences of the latest police chase gone bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ald. Ray Lopez (15th) noted that the Deering District, where the crash occurred after a pair of alleged carjackings by the same offender, struggles with “high crime and cyclical gang issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lopez said he is grateful to police officers who put their lives on the line to pursue Juan C. Vazquez, whom Lopez called an “individual who had no regard for human life and ultimately caused this accident trying to evade capture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As much as it pains me that we had an innocent life lost, it is still unacceptable to say this originates with us. ... This is again one of those lawsuits where we are, I’m not going to say rewarding criminality, but we are definitely paying for the mistakes of others,” Lopez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Juan C. Vazquez. That’s the individual [who] is incarcerated currently. He is the one who’s responsible for this,\" said Lopez. \"He and his group are the ones violently attacking people, violently attacking people in Brighton Park or wherever they did this. And they are the ones that need to bear the burden for this. The city of Chicago simply because we have the biggest checkbook —i t’s just not acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under questioning from Finance Chair and 3rd Ward Ald. Pat Dowell, Deputy Corporation Counsel Margaret Mendenhall-Casey said an asset check was conducted on Vazquez, but it “revealed that he did not have and does not have any financial assets\" that could be used to compensate the dead woman's family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s not particularly surprising.  ... He was 17 at the time of the accident and has been incarcerated since then” for reckless homicide, Mendenhall-Casey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ald. Bill Conway (34th), a former Cook County prosecutor, called Flores Gomez's death a “tragic situation\" and said he “hates the officer’s history” of having been involved in “at least four, if not five” prior police pursuits that caused accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A judge has already ruled that history is admissible at trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Conway said the officer was “pursuing a potentially armed carjacking hijacker” and that from the video, it was “pretty clear that it was a police vehicle, so the fact that it wasn’t marked I didn’t think was much of an issue.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t think the officer’s behavior in this case was willful and wanton,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Power, an attorney representing the family of Flores Gomez, said the decision to reject the $8.25 million settlement “might be something they regret.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They didn’t really look at the case in depth. If they did that, they might have a different opinion. It’s terrible,” Power said Wednesday. “This police car went through at 95 mph for 11 miles and nine minutes through neighborhoods and past schools, churches and parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It’s an unbelievable case with respect to how many rules they violated during this chase, and none of that was really discussed. They didn’t concentrate on the rules that were broke and how egregious this case was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A jury was picked in June before the city “increased their offer,” Power said. Now, it’ll full speed ahead toward a trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The City Council will have no say-so. It’ll be out of their hands,” Power said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conway said the failed settlement underscores how imperative it is for the City Council to “understand that we need to be investing in either more helicopters [or] more drone technology so we don’t put our officers in situations like this and the public in situations like this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ald. Nick Sposato (38th) noted that the Chicago Police Department’s general order requires a marked vehicle to join a vehicular chase and take the lead “as soon as possible or if possible.” That didn’t happen before the five-car crash that killed Flores Gomez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes it’s not possible. Otherwise, you might end up losing the chase,” Sposato said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Wednesday, the Finance Committee authorized a $1.9 million settlement to compensate the owners of abandoned vehicles with expired license plates whose vehicles were towed, impounded and disposed of without notice by mail.&lt;/p&gt;",

That means police Supt. Larry Snelling could still challenge COPA's conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney Andrew Stroth said Reed’s family “deserves to see the full investigative report,” insisting that Reed was “the victim of an unconstitutional traffic stop and then unjustifiably shot and killed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COPA lodged 15 allegations against the five officers who &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/dexter-reed\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;pulled Reed over in Humboldt Park&lt;/a&gt;, but only one charge was sustained, according to city records. COPA considered whether the officers violated Reed’s civil rights, used excessive force and wrongfully opened fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear which officer COPA seeks to discipline.

Peter Hawley, director of the Illinois Film Office, confirmed that “The Bear” is set to finish filming for season five in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawley couldn't give specific details on upcoming projects filming in Chicago this year, but he said, \"we're having a good year already, and we're in February.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Film Production Services Tax Credit, signed into law in December of last year, is helping incentivize productions to film here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawley said the show’s impact on the local dining scene has been significant. Chicagoans and tourists alike have flocked to popular restaurants that appeared in the show, from Grant Achatz’s Alinea to the bustling Filipino bakery and restaurant Kasama, just around the corner from this week’s filming location.
