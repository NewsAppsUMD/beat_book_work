      "summary": "<img alt=\"Gov. JB Pritzker last month at the Chicago Cultural Center.\" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91d1c3e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4486x2992+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa9%2F61%2F9720920a49a48af3d7e3c11ff260%2Fjazzday-260121-004.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;Gov. JB Pritzker announced a plan last week to “manage Illinois pension commitments through a set of proposals designed to build on the state’s recent fiscal progress and further reduce long-term risk for taxpayers and retirees.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price tag, however, is already giving one legislative leader pause. And “fiscal progress” is not the reality when factoring in federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor wants to use “unexpected surplus revenues” to pay down pension debt. That, in turn, will help the state reach 100% pension funding by 2048 (instead of the current goal of 90% by 2045) and make sure that some pension benefits meet the Social Security law’s minimum benefit standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Governor is proposing to redirect excess amounts not needed for state income tax refunds to pay down Illinois’ pension commitments by transferring surplus funds above a $150 million balance to the state’s retirement systems at the end of the year,” his press release claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-b30000\" name=\"module-b30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I asked how much the governor’s plan would cost. The price tag would vary from year to year, I was told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fiscal year 2024, the new pension idea would’ve cost a whopping $405 million, a governor’s office spokesperson said. In fiscal year 2025, the amount would’ve been $103 million. And this fiscal year, when the state budget is under siege by federal government budget cuts, the amount would’ve been $550 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know if this is the year to do it, because I don’t think we do that in isolation,” Senate President Don Harmon said of the governor’s idea during an event sponsored by Politico. “I think the price tag right now may be too much to pay, when tomorrow morning, we could be another billion dollars in the hole because of a tweet,” Harmon said of President Donald Trump, according to the publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, the Pritzker administration released a report about the impact of other federal actions on the state’s budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget report, the hit to the state budget from congressional tax changes alone will be “$587 million for the current fiscal year.” Legislation was passed during the veto session to reduce the original $830 million hit. And more legislative actions are expected later this spring to address some of the rest. Plus, this year’s amount will decrease over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can clearly see the point I’m trying to make here. An additional $550 million pension payment this fiscal year to help the state pay off the pension debt earlier would’ve greatly harmed the state’s ability to deal with the federal tax changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, there are definite advantages to the governor’s pension proposal, including long-term savings. Illinois has too often focused on the short term instead of thinking about long-term policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, man, I just do not see how Democratic legislators are gonna agree to take away any cash buffers while the state budget is under constant federal siege, with more likely on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Declining federal revenues&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Legislature’s Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability reported last week that January’s federal revenue sources plummeted 36% compared to the previous January. The fiscal year-to-date numbers had dropped 8% by the end of January, but last month was the third consecutive month of declining federal revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal tax changes and revenue hits are, of course, just the tip of the spear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Governor’s Office of Management and Budget report noted that preparing for new eligibility rules for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and Medicaid will cost the state $100 million during the next two fiscal years. Increases to state SNAP administrative costs will increase by $80 million a year beginning next fiscal year. If the state’s SNAP “error rate” isn’t reduced, the state’s taxpayers will have to pony up $705 million a year. Federal Medicaid payments are scheduled to be reduced by $4.5 billion over the next five years, and $3.8 billion a year beginning in seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least for the time being, the state really needs to move to a fiscal “war footing” — for lack of a better term. Illinois has to make sure it can provide an adequate social safety net and provide basic services. All new spending ideas really should be put on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, please save your press release bills until after this immediate crisis passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of talk about new “progressive” revenues. But even if the state goes that route, it still has to stop with the new spending ideas and focus on protecting and building on what exists now, at least for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rich Miller also publishes Capitol Fax, a daily political newsletter, and CapitolFax.com.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-d30000\" name=\"module-d30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Young players, especially taller players, sometimes mature rapidly and evolve from bench players to impactful starters in a shockingly short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s happening at Joliet West for 6-7 senior Ryan Lipke. The Tigers knocked off host Plainfield East 76-61 on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/06/chicago-high-school-basketball-scores-illinois\"   &gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipke finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds and made 2 of 3 three-pointers. Tigers coach Jeremy Kreiger saw Lipke's high-level play in practice early in the season, but it took a while for it to arrive in games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He didn't quite believe in himself yet,\" Kreiger said. \"The versatility he offers to step out and make threes while also commanding the paint makes him very special. He's shooting 43% from three on high volume. It’s been a positive thing to see over the course of the season.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipke transferred from Providence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The culture and the coaches are great here, so that was an easy adjustment,\" Lipke said. \"This improvement was just mental with me. I had to increase my motor and work harder.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipke scored 23 points in an overtime loss to Bolingbrook last month. Taking the Raiders to the limit was the first sign that Joliet West (18-8, 12-2 Southwest Prairie East) had significantly improved since the Pontiac Holiday Tournament in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tigers led Plainfield East by 22 at halftime, but KJ Miller, one of the state's most highly-regarded junior prospects, scored 10 points in the third quarter to help get the Bengals (16-11, 8-6) back in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller finished with 26 points. He drained a three-pointer with 4:33 left to pull Plainfield East within 61-55, but that was as close as it would get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We knew [Plainfield East] had a load of offensive talent,\" Kreiger said. \"They are really good at making tough shots and when they start to go in that feeds their confidence.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior guard Deven Triplett led Joliet West with 21 points and six rebounds and Aamir Shannon added 20 points and seven rebounds. The Tigers out-rebounded Plainfield East 33-24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-4e0000\" name=\"image-4e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba6d974/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2Fb3%2F7ce822254b589bf1db5ca9e50a0a%2Fob-cst-020726-7007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ce962e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2Fb3%2F7ce822254b589bf1db5ca9e50a0a%2Fob-cst-020726-7007.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a2e1857/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2Fb3%2F7ce822254b589bf1db5ca9e50a0a%2Fob-cst-020726-7007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Joliet West&amp;#x27;s Aamir Shannon (0) takes the ball to the basket against Plainfield East.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a2e1857/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2Fb3%2F7ce822254b589bf1db5ca9e50a0a%2Fob-cst-020726-7007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d8b18a8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2Fb3%2F7ce822254b589bf1db5ca9e50a0a%2Fob-cst-020726-7007.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a2e1857/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2Fb3%2F7ce822254b589bf1db5ca9e50a0a%2Fob-cst-020726-7007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joliet West’s Aamir Shannon (0) takes the ball to the basket against Plainfield East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We weren't making the shots we did in the first half,\" Shannon said. \"So we had to double down on our defense and stay focused on our principles.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Alijah Little, who started high school at Plainfield East and transferred to Young last season, added 14 points for the Bengals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joliet West shot 10-for-23 from three-point range. Kreiger isn't allowing his team to take midrange shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Not even at the end of the shot clock,\" Kreiger said. \"There are four shots you are allowed to take: free throws, layups and dunks, catch and shoot threes or any shot you master. High school kids don't usually master shots. So we have three shots we take. That's why we have been more efficient offensively.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joliet West is hosting a Class 4A sectional and has gone from an afterthought to a contender. The much-improved Tigers will be able to compete with Marist, Homewood-Flossmoor, Lockport and Rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The Bolingbrook game went bad for us in overtime,\" Shannon said. \"But after that we knew what we had and we knew we could push ahead and make a run in the state tournament.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Charges of aggravated battery and criminal damage to property were dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mural, near 16th Street and Ashland Avenue, depicts a Mexican man and a Palestinian man resting peacefully in a field. Wasserman painted “Israel” in large letters over the mural, burned off the face of the Palestinian man and spread feces on the wall and sidewalk, according to a witness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case stems from two incidents in May and June in which witnesses confronted Wasserman as she allegedly vandalized the mural. She was &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2025/08/08/woman-suspected-of-vandalizing-palestinian-mural-charged-with-hate-crime-battery\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;charged last August&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie Figueroa was riding her bike June 13 when she saw Wasserman vandalizing the mural and confronted her, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/06/18/pilsen-mural-attack\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;she previously told the Sun-Times&lt;/a&gt;. An argument turned physical when Wasserman allegedly struck Figueroa with a metal pole, leaving her with two black eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A passerby called 911, but Wasserman had walked away by the time police arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wasserman was also seen throwing trash at the mural May 9, according to another witness. She allegedly tried to choke that witness with a scarf before leaving the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wasserman was arrested June 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plea deal also requires Wasserman to complete 200 hours of community service and to enroll in an education program discouraging hate crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These felony hate-crime convictions were necessary to ensure the legal record reflected the truth of what occurred,” said Farah Chalisa, an attorney representing the victims. “Too often, attacks against Palestinian and allied communities are minimized, while expressions of solidarity are villainized. Here, finally, the legal record archives Wasserman's conduct candidly, as bias-motivated violence intended to harm and intimidate these communities.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mural, representing the solidarity of Mexicans and Palestinians, was painted in May by Taqi Spateen, an artist from Bethlehem in the West Bank. It was commissioned by the Mural Movement, which aims to transform communities through art and activism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-8a0000\" name=\"image-8a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/39a7217/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1149+0+108/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F9f%2F88b4c3fd44768f0601e2c2c6d258%2Fdscf9638.JPEG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3d444ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1149+0+108/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F9f%2F88b4c3fd44768f0601e2c2c6d258%2Fdscf9638.JPEG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0eb0d94/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1149+0+108/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F9f%2F88b4c3fd44768f0601e2c2c6d258%2Fdscf9638.JPEG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A photo of the Palestinian man on the mural before it was vandalized\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0eb0d94/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1149+0+108/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F9f%2F88b4c3fd44768f0601e2c2c6d258%2Fdscf9638.JPEG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5cfff3e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1149+0+108/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F9f%2F88b4c3fd44768f0601e2c2c6d258%2Fdscf9638.JPEG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0eb0d94/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1149+0+108/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F9f%2F88b4c3fd44768f0601e2c2c6d258%2Fdscf9638.JPEG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A photo of the Palestinian man on the mural before it was vandalized&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Students and parents questioned whether the school had allowed itself to be used to promote a political agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McMahon’s Education Department has made many controversial moves, including stripping funding from programs that support Black, Latino, transgender and disabled students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some disagree with these policies and approaches and feel like they are harmful to the community at large,” he said during a Thursday news conference at the school. “With that being said, do we cancel and hide the opportunity for her to come to our school? Or do we have an opportunity to show her who we are and welcome her into this space?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half the students at the school did not attend the assembly with McMahon, which Muzikowski said was “perfectly fine” with him.

The school’s walls feature posters of prominent Black figures like Booker T. Washington and Barack Obama, as well as a Black History Month bulletin board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McMahon’s “History Rocks!” tour has been controversial as it’s made its way across the country. According to the Education Department, the tour is intended to “showcase examples of high-quality history and civics instruction that bring American principles to life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is being done in conjunction with 40 conservative organizations, and many question whether the history and civics education being promoted is inclusive and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just last week, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/29/fairfield-announces-then-abruptly-cancels-school-visit-by-linda-mcmahon/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;an elementary school in Connecticut canceled a History Rocks! visit by McMahon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after parents raised concerns about the politicization of the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After visiting Chicago Hope Academy on Thursday, McMahon went to Genoa-Kingston High School in northern Illinois &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.northernpublicradio.org/illinois/2026-02-05/department-of-education-tour-polarizes-students-at-genoa-kingston-high-school\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;where she attended a History Rocks! event with Erika Kirk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the widow of Charlie Kirk, who cofounded the campus activism group Turning Point USA. Kirk was considered a leading voice for young conservatives before he was shot and killed last year. The Genoa-Kingston event drew about 50 protesters, according to reporting by Northern Public Radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a short press conference after the Chicago Hope assembly, McMahon said she was happy to be invited to the Genoa-Kingston event by Kirk, saying that Turning Point USA was one of the first organizations to promote free speech and the idea that it's important to “present both sides.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McMahon also said she thinks people in Connecticut “misunderstood” what the tour was about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's totally nonpartisan,” she said. “It is just absolutely about civics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Hope assembly was not open to the media. But Muzikowski said that McMahon gave a short speech where she brought up some historical facts about the United States and Illinois. She didn’t mention any figures, but mentioned things like that Illinois was the 21st state to join the union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then led a trivia competition between students that McMahon described as “kind of like 'Family Feud.'” Muzikowski said the Education Department staff gave him some questions to ask, but he added some of his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love the principal. I thought Ike was a lot of fun,” McMahon said. “The kids seemed to have a great rapport with him, with the teachers and with this family-based school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muzikowski said that when he agreed to McMahon’s visit he did not realize it would be so controversial. What followed was days of intense conversation. He held town hall meetings with students and parents and said he was surprised at how opposed a lot of them were to the visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we learned is that it is very easy to point the finger and label and judge and be disappointed internally for our own community,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said in the end he thinks it was a good learning experience for students about rubbing shoulders and listening to people, even if they disagree.&lt;/p&gt;",

Schools that refused faced immediate loss of federal funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois and many other states declined to sign, arguing the department's requirements were vague and legally unsupported, Raoul said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raoul joined attorneys general from California, Massachusetts, Minnesota and New York in filing a lawsuit on April 25, 2025, challenging the funding threat as unconstitutional. The states argued it violated the Spending Clause, Appropriations Clause and separation of powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A related lawsuit by the American Federation of Teachers successfully vacated the April 3 certification request. Friday's agreement ensures that relief applies to Illinois schools and prevents the administration from withholding funding based on the disputed conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protected funding supports programs for low-income and rural students, special education services, teacher recruitment and training, English-language learner programs, services for foster care children and students without housing and career technical education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia joined the agreement, including Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Michaels used the photo in an online sale for the spray paint from June to early January, the lawsuit states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are obviously appalled that a 'store for artists' would sue an artist, who was simply trying to protect his work,” Nickel’s lawyer, Jeff Gluck, said in a statement to the Sun-Times. “He clearly never authorized Michaels to use his artwork and their ridiculous lawsuit is nothing more than a transparent attempt to discourage and intimidate Mr. Nickel, a beloved Chicago-based artist, into dropping his legitimate claims against them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gluck said Nickel has received an “outpour of support from the global artist community” after the lawsuit was filed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Michaels could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit claims Nickel’s artwork was not copyrighted until January, when Nickel sent the store the cease and desist letter. Michaels removed the artwork from its website after receiving the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michaels is seeking a declaratory judgment from the court that it has not infringed Nickel’s property rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed in Texas, where Michaels is headquartered.&lt;/p&gt;",

He was taken into custody by immigration authorities the next day, and he’s since been detained at the Clay County Justice Center in Brazil, Indiana, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney Michael Adler filed a petition Monday in the Southern District of Indiana challenging Espinoza Martinez’s&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;detention. Adler told the judge his client lived in Chicago for 30 years and worked for the last decade at his brother’s construction company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He has never been convicted of a crime,” Adler wrote. “He has never given anyone reason to doubt his character.

It followed a picture of Bovino and read, “2k on info cuando lo agarren,” “10k if u take him down,” and “LK … on him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man who received the message, Adrian Jimenez, testified that he understood it to mean “$2,000 when they grab him … $10,000 if you kill him … Latin Kings are on him.” Jimenez said he immediately turned it over to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bovino served as the face of the immigration campaign launched by the Trump administration in Chicago last year, Operation Midway Blitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors also pointed to separate messages Espinoza Martinez sent to his brother, including “10k for his head” below a picture of Bovino,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;along with “dead or alive” and “s--t serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But defense attorneys Jonathan Bedi and Dena Singer pointed out that no money exchanged hands. No weapons were purchased. And social media “is riddled with things that aren’t true,” Singer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You should demand that there’s other evidence before you can convict somebody for this,” she told the jury.&lt;/p&gt;",

Jan Schakowsky’s seat in one of the most competitive races the state has seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates include Kat Abughazaleh, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, state Sen. Laura Fine (D-Glenview), Phil Andrew, Bushra Amiwala, state Sen. Mike Simmons, economist Jeff Cohen, State Rep. Hoan Huynh, former federal prosecutor Nick Pyati, veteran Sam Polan, civil rights attorney Howard Rosenblum, Evanston resident Bethany Johnson, union organizer Justin Ford, Patricia A. Brown and Mark Arnold Fredrickson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;So what?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seat in this very blue congressional district hasn't been open since 1999. Before that, the seat was represented by Sidney R. Yates, who held it for 24 terms — with a two-year gap for an unsuccessful Senate bid in 1962 against Everett Dirksen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rocio Cleveland, John Elleson, Paul Friedman and Mark Su are running in the Republican primary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What does a U.S. representative do?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives vote on federal laws, advocate for their districts and work to secure federal funding and other resources for constituents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why is U.S. representative a powerful position?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of Congress vote on laws that affect all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who are the candidates?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-738b98b0-03ad-11f1-b777-9dc4e6d28ffc\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kat Abughazaleh is a former journalist and progressive content creator who announced her bid even before Schakowsky announced her retirement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bushra Amiwala, a Skokie School Board District member, is a 28-year-old self-described “homegrown fighter putting people first.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phil Andrew survived a mass shooting in Winnetka in 1988, then became an FBI special agent specializing in negotiations, as well as a gun control advocate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daniel Biss is a former mathematician, state representative and state senator who was elected Evanston mayor in 2021.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patricia A. Brown is a lifelong Evanston resident and previously worked in health care, education, corporate America and the American Bar Association.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jeff Cohen, an economist&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; says the country needs a “revenue-neutral income and child care bill” that would modernize both credits to allow for monthly or quarterly payments without changing eligibility criteria or benefit levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laura Fine, D-Glenview, has served in the state Senate since 2018 and previously served in the Illinois House.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mark Arnold Fredrickson is an IT consultant and attorney.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Justin Ford is a health professional and union organizer. He calls his “signature” issue a federally mandated four-day work week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hoan Huynh is the first refugee and Vietnamese American elected to office in Illinois. He is serving his second term in the Illinois House, representing the 13th District.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bethany Johnson worked on Angus King’s U.S. Senate campaign in Maine in 2018, and helped to fight for an LGBTQ+ rights ordinance in Missouri.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sam Polan served in the U.S. Army as a captain and later worked for the Department of Defense. His platform includes expanding mental health care and reproductive freedoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nick Pyati is a former Microsoft strategist who believes AI, clean energy and new technology are reshaping work and life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Howard Rosenblum is a Skokie native and for 33 years has litigated for the civil rights of people with disabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mike Simmons was appointed to the state Senate in 2021 and was elected in 2022 to represent the 7th District.

Robin Kelly's decision to launch a bid to replace outgoing Sen. Dick Durbin set up a contentious 10-person open race in the 2nd Congressional District Democratic primary, including a political comeback attempt by former Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook County Commissioner Donna Miller is leading fundraising in the crowded field. State Sen. Robert Peters, D-Chicago, has the progressive backing, including a glowing endorsement from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. Rounding out the field are state Sen. Willie Preston; Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Board member Yumeka Brown; Adal Regis, who worked in Kelly’s district office; management consultant Eric France; attorney Patrick “PJK” Keating; Toni C. Brown and Sidney Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;So what?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly has held the seat since 2013, and the primary winner in the heavily Democratic district will be favored to replace her. They'll face the winner of the Republican primary; Mike Noack is the only Republican on the March 17 ballot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What does a U.S. representative do?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives vote on federal laws, advocate for their districts and work to secure federal funding and other resources for constituents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why is U.S. representative a powerful position?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of Congress vote on laws that affect all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who are the candidates?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-92ae8742-fd39-11f0-a56e-bf18f95939f2\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jesse Jackson Jr.&lt;/b&gt; represented the 2nd Congressional District from 1995 until his resignation in 2012. He left Congress amid mental health issues and, ultimately, federal charges lodged against him for misusing his campaign funds. He says he wants to prioritize getting Chicago its third airport to help boost economic development in the south suburbs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donna Miller&lt;/b&gt; is serving her second term as 6th District commissioner in the Cook County Board. She is pushing for Medicare for All, maternal health and reproductive justice and for good jobs and lower costs for working families, among other policy priorities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robert Peters&lt;/b&gt; was appointed to the state Senate in 2019 to succeed now-state Attorney General Kwame Raoul. A former community organizer, Peters sponsored the state measure that ended cash bail in Illinois and passed laws to raise the minimum wage. Peters wants Medicare for All and to abolish ICE.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Willie Preston&lt;/b&gt; has served in the Illinois Senate since 2023 and is the chair of the Legislative Black Caucus. Preston is pushing for more trade schools in the district.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yumeka Brown&lt;/b&gt; served as village clerk of Matteson and currently serves as a Metropolitan Water Reclamation District commissioner. She said she’s running because she believes in environmental justice, clean water and safe streets, affordable health care, jobs that pay a living wage and strong public schools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adal Regis&lt;/b&gt; said he helped secure millions in federal funding for local governments, small businesses and nonprofits while working in Kelly’s office. As director of strategy at a Chicago-based environmental nonprofit, he leads clean energy and climate resilience initiatives in neighborhoods that need investment. He says that experience would equip him to advocate for affordable housing, public safety, environmental equity and economic opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eric France&lt;/b&gt;, a strategist, says the state must extend existing public transportation and expand airports to support the movement of cargo and passenger traffic. He also supports expanding affordable housing in the district and pushing federal down-payment assistance programs for first-time buyers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Patrick \"PJK\" Keating&lt;/b&gt;, a Flossmoor resident, is a trial and appellate lawyer. He calls himself a “commonsense Democrat” and says Democrats and a functioning Congress “must be defined by what we as the majority are for, not just who we are against.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sidney Moore&lt;/b&gt;, who worked on several political campaigns, also ran for Illinois Secretary of State in 2022. He says he’s not a career politician and isn’t run by party politics or special interests. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Toni C. Brown&lt;/b&gt; is on the ballot but does not have a publicly available campaign website or social media pages. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-b60000\" name=\"module-b60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Illinois 2026 primary election schedule&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feb. 5&lt;/b&gt;: Early voting and vote by mail begins&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 1&lt;/b&gt;: Online voter registration ends, but voters may register in person at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.elections.il.gov/VotingAndRegistrationSystems/EarlyVotingLocationsSearch.aspx\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;election authority and early voting sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 12&lt;/b&gt;: Deadline for online and posted applications to vote by mail; in-person requests for absentee ballots may be made through March 16&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 17&lt;/b&gt;: Polls open for Primary Election Day from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 31&lt;/b&gt;: Deadline to return absentee ballots postmarked on or before Primary Election Day&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Regardless of whether he beats the Patriots on Sunday at Levi’s Stadium, Darnold won the argument. He’s too good to deny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when presented with the opportunity to gloat, he didn’t bother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t really come down to that for me,” Darnold said. “It’s always just been about putting in the hard work every single day. And sometimes hard work and dedication and all the hours I put in in the offseason leads to this moment. That’s the mindset I’ve had my entire career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly eight years after the Jets drafted him third overall, with back-to-back Pro Bowl selections and now a Super Bowl appearance, the league still seems somewhat unsure what to make of Darnold. A win Sunday would clarify it once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after a breakout performance with the Vikings last season, his market in free agency was modest. The Seahawks got him on merely a three-year deal, and his $33.5 million average pay ranks 18th at his position. That contract says they weren’t fully convinced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, he proved that his superb 2024 season with the Vikings was an arrival, not an aberration. He ranked in the top 11 in passer rating (99.1), yardage (238.1 per game) and touchdown passes (25) this season. He threw 14 interceptions, but had just four in his last nine games, including none in the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In wins over the 49ers and Rams that got the Seahawks to Super Bowl, Darnold totaled 470 yards, four touchdowns and a 122.4 passer rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His teammates are happy to flex on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wide receiver &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/05/super-bowl-lx-features-elite-wide-receivers-in-seahawks-jaxon-smith-njigba-patriots-stefan-diggs\"   &gt;Jaxon Smith-Njigba&lt;/a&gt;, the league’s Offensive Player of the Year with 1,759 yards and 10 touchdown catches, said this week, “I wouldn’t be in this position without him.” Receiver Cooper Kupp showed up to one media availability this week wearing a t-shirt that read, “I (heart) Sam Darnold.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter if others still aren’t sold. The Seahawks are all in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From year to year and week to week, just one of the more resilient people I’ve ever been around,” said quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko, a former Bears assistant. “Whether he’s coming off a big win or a loss, his want to get back to work and his commitment to each step of the preparation and his enjoyment of that sets him apart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of Darnold’s low points typically would’ve been the end for a quarterback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jets were done with him after three seasons in which he threw almost as many interceptions (39) as touchdown passes (45), had a 78.6 passer rating and went 13-25 as a starter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Panthers’ trade for him in 2021, in which they gave up second-, fourth- and sixth-round picks still is laughed about in league circles as an embarrassingly bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And after beginning his career in the Jets’ trademark dysfunction, he encountered more of the same with the bumbling Panthers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Darnold finally had control of his future as a free agent in 2023, he wisely went to the 49ers as a backup for respected coach Kyle Shanahan. He then furthered his football education by taking a backup job with the Vikings under another quarterback guru in Kevin O’Connell, and the door opened for him when rookie J.J. McCarthy missed the season with a knee injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, he took off. Now everyone sees the potential he always knew he had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest thing is to believe in yourself,” Darnold said. “I’ve always had confidence, and I’ve learned. I learned a ton from the mistakes I made early in my career, and that mindset got me to this point.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-bc0001\" name=\"list-bc0001\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears, subTitle=null, pagination=[{body=[Next Page], href=?p=2, _template=/link/Link.hbs, contentId=null, pianoSectionSlug=null, target=null}], stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, _styledTemplate=/page/list/PageListH.hbs, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, items=[{type=Image, category=[{items=[Bears]}], publishDate=February 06, 2026 04:28 PM, wordCount=838, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, isFeatured=false, media=[{alt=Bears quarterback Jim McMahon works the crowd during Super Bowl XX., image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/21/b1/2e6fd36b243a575bc0bb67e781a3/ap942601127815.jpg, width=2498, height=1906}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/21/b1/2e6fd36b243a575bc0bb67e781a3/ap942601127815.jpg, width=2498, height=1906}}], authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/steve-greenberg, media=[{ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=258097893_10227367806079844_1724022405929237952_n.jpg, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/11/58/fc94fb4e49bebd891825a398c8d4/258097893-10227367806079844-1724022405929237952-n.jpg, width=750, height=750}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/11/58/fc94fb4e49bebd891825a398c8d4/258097893-10227367806079844-1724022405929237952-n.jpg, width=750, height=750}}], bio=[{items=[Steve Greenberg is a sports columnist at the Chicago Sun-Times.]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, name=[{items=[Steve Greenberg]}], jobTitle=[{items=[Reporter/columnist, sports]}]}], description=[{items=[Chicago has loved the Shufflin’ Crew for so long, the whole thing is far past the point of becoming a caricature of itself.

If those materials were not made available to prosecutors, it could compromise their discovery obligations under federal and state law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson issued the Ice on Notice executive order following public outrage over fatal shootings by &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/01/30/suburban-teen-brothers-on-ice-watch-in-minneapolis-this-is-nothing-like-chicago-this-is-so-much-worse\"   &gt;federal immigration agents in Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;. The order directs police to preserve evidence and document alleged abuses by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents for potential prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At his weekly news conference, Johnson defended the order as a necessary response to what he called \"rogue, reckless behavior of federal agents.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I wish I did not have to use executive authority to provide protection for the residents of the city of Chicago because the president of the United States of America has declared war on our city,\" Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Neill Burke said this week that she was reviewing the mayor’s order after Johnson “falsely claimed” that her office had backed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor said he plans to use a 30-day rule-making period to address O'Neill Burke's concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill Burke's office is currently prosecuting &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/01/30/new-body-camera-footage-shows-aftermath-of-ice-officer-allegedly-attacking-activist-near-chicago\"   &gt;ICE Agent Adam Saracco&lt;/a&gt;, who faces a misdemeanor battery charge for allegedly attacking a protester at a gas station in Brookfield while off-duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's attorney said federal and state law limits prosecutors' ability to charge on-duty federal agents except in narrow circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the memo, Loizon said the state's attorney's office has drafted a protocol for handling cases involving federal agents and shared it with Chicago police, Illinois State Police, the Cook County Sheriff's Office and state's attorneys from around Illinois for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We will be sure to share it with the mayor's office when appropriate so we can meaningfully collaborate in the name of public safety,\" Loizon wrote.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

On Sunday, she sat down with Sun-Times and WBEZ reporters &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/03/marimar-martinez-shot-border-patrol-chicago-speaks-out-after-good-pretti-deaths-i-am-their-voice\"   &gt;to recount the events of that day, her recovery and her advocacy&lt;/a&gt;. In the wake of the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, there's been increased scrutiny of federal agents' use of force, and Martinez's first-hand account is more relevant than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How did you get the photo?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez sat for a two-hour interview with reporters Jon Seidel and Adriana Cardona-Maguigad. I was tasked with making still images as Zubaer Khan filmed video. The wide-ranging conversation covered sensitive topics including the shooting itself, the government labeling Martinez as a \"domestic terrorist\" and the impact on her family. There were a few moments when Martinez became visibly emotional. I was concerned that she would be too drained by the end of the interview to sit for additional portraits, but she obliged. I had to quickly rearrange the room for photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried a few frames in the dark recording studio, relying on the overhead lighting Khan used to shoot video. I even tried to incorporate the blue strip lighting that ran along the walls to add some visual interest with color. Cardona-Maguigad was watching nearby and gently asked how the lighting was in the space. I was grateful for the question because it allowed me to acknowledge that the environment was challenging and gave me an opportunity to ask Martinez for just a little more of her time in order to try a new set up. I took her to the lobby area filled with bright light and positioned her next to the window. Half of her face was illuminated and the other fell in shadow, which felt tonally appropriate for the story — she's experienced a dark, traumatic event, but now stands as a beacon of defiance against injustice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Technical details:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-c99fb892-fdf8-11f0-8afa-b3d074ccce9f\" style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: border-box;

The order also instructs federal agencies to promote sales to individual owner-occupants through first-look policies, disclosure requirements and anti-circumvention measures, according to the White House.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures are a part of Trump's wider push to make everything from groceries to homeownership more affordable. As home prices rise, so has the median age of first-time homebuyers. The National Association of Realtors says the median age of first-time buyers in the U.S. is 40 years old — the oldest it has been in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the glaring issue is that the order doesn’t block all purchases from institutional buyers, said Frank Manzo, an economist at the Illinois Economic Policy Institute. These buyers are often private equity firms that own thousands of homes and rental units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Institutional investors, especially in the single-family rental market, typically purchase their properties in cash,” Manzo said. “Or, if they're financing it, they're using private sources, and all of that is outside ... what the executive order would address. Ultimately, the executive order doesn’t have that much teeth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order’s impact would also be smaller in Chicago, where the share of homes owned by investors is below the national average. Data from Redfin puts the national share of homes owned by investors at 17% as of third quarter 2025, the most recent data available. In Chicago, that figure is 13%, according to Redfin. Investors purchased nearly 2,400 homes in Chicago during the third quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Investor activity recently experienced rapid growth following the COVID-19 pandemic, and that really reduced the supply of homes that were available for individuals and families to purchase,” Manzo said. “Investor purchases have declined in the last two years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While investor purchases have been declining nationally, Manzo said that’s not the case in Chicago and Illinois, where home prices and valuation continue to rise above the national average. Investors purchased more than 1,000 homes in Chicago between the second and third quarters last year, according to Redfin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But investors are only one factor contributing to the state’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/housing/2025/06/25/a-new-study-finds-illinois-needs-to-build-45-000-homes-for-five-years-to-address-its-housing-shortage\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;housing shortage&lt;/a&gt;. Manzo published a study in June 2024 that examines Illinois’ housing shortage and ways the state could fix it; the study's co-author was Robert Bruno, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and director of the school’s Project for Middle Class Renewal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study says Illinois’ housing shortage has been driven by several demand, supply and regulatory factors, including investor ownership of properties. According to the report, the buying of homes by investors is raising home prices by reducing the number of properties available on the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manzo said investors tend to purchase homes in “trendier” Chicago neighborhoods on the North and West sides, where younger people may be looking to rent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some argue these investors do good by rehabbing properties that might otherwise fall into foreclosure, in turn increasing the rental supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But too often, Manzo said those investors raise rents, skimp on maintenance and turn homes into vacation rentals, thereby reducing housing options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Investor activity has been found to degrade affordability for young households, in particular, who are seeking starter homes,” Manzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research from &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.housingstudies.org/blog/Examining_Role_Corporate_Landlords/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;DePaul University’s Institute for Housing Studies &lt;/a&gt;in 2024 found elected officials of cities, towns and villages in the Greater Chicago region had similar concerns about institutional landlords in their communities. Elected officials said their challenges with institutional owners included reaching property owners about maintenance issues and code violations; a possible decline in homeownership; and limited government resources for regulating the landlords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manzo said more steps could be taken to address institutional landlords, such as congressional laws to help spur new construction and buy backs of homes from investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data is just really clear that the people of Illinois want to own their homes, because our homeownership rate is consistently higher than the nation’s, and that's despite the fact that we have kind of really high &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/11/17/cook-county-property-taxes-analysis-treasurer-maria-pappas-downtown-south-west-sides\"   &gt;property taxes&lt;/a&gt;,” Manzo said. “We have a high homeownership rate, and we need to find ways to give the people what they want, which is more homes.”&lt;/p&gt;",
