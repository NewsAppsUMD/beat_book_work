      "summary": "<img alt=\"Gov. JB Pritzker last month at the Chicago Cultural Center.\" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91d1c3e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4486x2992+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa9%2F61%2F9720920a49a48af3d7e3c11ff260%2Fjazzday-260121-004.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;Gov. JB Pritzker announced a plan last week to “manage Illinois pension commitments through a set of proposals designed to build on the state’s recent fiscal progress and further reduce long-term risk for taxpayers and retirees.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price tag, however, is already giving one legislative leader pause. And “fiscal progress” is not the reality when factoring in federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor wants to use “unexpected surplus revenues” to pay down pension debt. That, in turn, will help the state reach 100% pension funding by 2048 (instead of the current goal of 90% by 2045) and make sure that some pension benefits meet the Social Security law’s minimum benefit standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Governor is proposing to redirect excess amounts not needed for state income tax refunds to pay down Illinois’ pension commitments by transferring surplus funds above a $150 million balance to the state’s retirement systems at the end of the year,” his press release claimed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-b30000\" name=\"module-b30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I asked how much the governor’s plan would cost. The price tag would vary from year to year, I was told.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fiscal year 2024, the new pension idea would’ve cost a whopping $405 million, a governor’s office spokesperson said. In fiscal year 2025, the amount would’ve been $103 million. And this fiscal year, when the state budget is under siege by federal government budget cuts, the amount would’ve been $550 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know if this is the year to do it, because I don’t think we do that in isolation,” Senate President Don Harmon said of the governor’s idea during an event sponsored by Politico. “I think the price tag right now may be too much to pay, when tomorrow morning, we could be another billion dollars in the hole because of a tweet,” Harmon said of President Donald Trump, according to the publication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, the Pritzker administration released a report about the impact of other federal actions on the state’s budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget report, the hit to the state budget from congressional tax changes alone will be “$587 million for the current fiscal year.” Legislation was passed during the veto session to reduce the original $830 million hit. And more legislative actions are expected later this spring to address some of the rest. Plus, this year’s amount will decrease over the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can clearly see the point I’m trying to make here. An additional $550 million pension payment this fiscal year to help the state pay off the pension debt earlier would’ve greatly harmed the state’s ability to deal with the federal tax changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, there are definite advantages to the governor’s pension proposal, including long-term savings. Illinois has too often focused on the short term instead of thinking about long-term policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, man, I just do not see how Democratic legislators are gonna agree to take away any cash buffers while the state budget is under constant federal siege, with more likely on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Declining federal revenues&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Legislature’s Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability reported last week that January’s federal revenue sources plummeted 36% compared to the previous January. The fiscal year-to-date numbers had dropped 8% by the end of January, but last month was the third consecutive month of declining federal revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal tax changes and revenue hits are, of course, just the tip of the spear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Governor’s Office of Management and Budget report noted that preparing for new eligibility rules for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and Medicaid will cost the state $100 million during the next two fiscal years. Increases to state SNAP administrative costs will increase by $80 million a year beginning next fiscal year. If the state’s SNAP “error rate” isn’t reduced, the state’s taxpayers will have to pony up $705 million a year. Federal Medicaid payments are scheduled to be reduced by $4.5 billion over the next five years, and $3.8 billion a year beginning in seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least for the time being, the state really needs to move to a fiscal “war footing” — for lack of a better term. Illinois has to make sure it can provide an adequate social safety net and provide basic services. All new spending ideas really should be put on hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, please save your press release bills until after this immediate crisis passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty of talk about new “progressive” revenues. But even if the state goes that route, it still has to stop with the new spending ideas and focus on protecting and building on what exists now, at least for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rich Miller also publishes Capitol Fax, a daily political newsletter, and CapitolFax.com.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-d30000\" name=\"module-d30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Young players, especially taller players, sometimes mature rapidly and evolve from bench players to impactful starters in a shockingly short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s happening at Joliet West for 6-7 senior Ryan Lipke. The Tigers knocked off host Plainfield East 76-61 on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/06/chicago-high-school-basketball-scores-illinois\"   &gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipke finished with 19 points and 10 rebounds and made 2 of 3 three-pointers. Tigers coach Jeremy Kreiger saw Lipke's high-level play in practice early in the season, but it took a while for it to arrive in games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He didn't quite believe in himself yet,\" Kreiger said. \"The versatility he offers to step out and make threes while also commanding the paint makes him very special. He's shooting 43% from three on high volume. It’s been a positive thing to see over the course of the season.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipke transferred from Providence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The culture and the coaches are great here, so that was an easy adjustment,\" Lipke said. \"This improvement was just mental with me. I had to increase my motor and work harder.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipke scored 23 points in an overtime loss to Bolingbrook last month. Taking the Raiders to the limit was the first sign that Joliet West (18-8, 12-2 Southwest Prairie East) had significantly improved since the Pontiac Holiday Tournament in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tigers led Plainfield East by 22 at halftime, but KJ Miller, one of the state's most highly-regarded junior prospects, scored 10 points in the third quarter to help get the Bengals (16-11, 8-6) back in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller finished with 26 points. He drained a three-pointer with 4:33 left to pull Plainfield East within 61-55, but that was as close as it would get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We knew [Plainfield East] had a load of offensive talent,\" Kreiger said. \"They are really good at making tough shots and when they start to go in that feeds their confidence.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior guard Deven Triplett led Joliet West with 21 points and six rebounds and Aamir Shannon added 20 points and seven rebounds. The Tigers out-rebounded Plainfield East 33-24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-4e0000\" name=\"image-4e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba6d974/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2Fb3%2F7ce822254b589bf1db5ca9e50a0a%2Fob-cst-020726-7007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ce962e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2Fb3%2F7ce822254b589bf1db5ca9e50a0a%2Fob-cst-020726-7007.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a2e1857/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2Fb3%2F7ce822254b589bf1db5ca9e50a0a%2Fob-cst-020726-7007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Joliet West&amp;#x27;s Aamir Shannon (0) takes the ball to the basket against Plainfield East.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a2e1857/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2Fb3%2F7ce822254b589bf1db5ca9e50a0a%2Fob-cst-020726-7007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d8b18a8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2Fb3%2F7ce822254b589bf1db5ca9e50a0a%2Fob-cst-020726-7007.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a2e1857/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2Fb3%2F7ce822254b589bf1db5ca9e50a0a%2Fob-cst-020726-7007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joliet West’s Aamir Shannon (0) takes the ball to the basket against Plainfield East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We weren't making the shots we did in the first half,\" Shannon said. \"So we had to double down on our defense and stay focused on our principles.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Alijah Little, who started high school at Plainfield East and transferred to Young last season, added 14 points for the Bengals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joliet West shot 10-for-23 from three-point range. Kreiger isn't allowing his team to take midrange shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Not even at the end of the shot clock,\" Kreiger said. \"There are four shots you are allowed to take: free throws, layups and dunks, catch and shoot threes or any shot you master. High school kids don't usually master shots. So we have three shots we take. That's why we have been more efficient offensively.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joliet West is hosting a Class 4A sectional and has gone from an afterthought to a contender. The much-improved Tigers will be able to compete with Marist, Homewood-Flossmoor, Lockport and Rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The Bolingbrook game went bad for us in overtime,\" Shannon said. \"But after that we knew what we had and we knew we could push ahead and make a run in the state tournament.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Charges of aggravated battery and criminal damage to property were dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mural, near 16th Street and Ashland Avenue, depicts a Mexican man and a Palestinian man resting peacefully in a field. Wasserman painted “Israel” in large letters over the mural, burned off the face of the Palestinian man and spread feces on the wall and sidewalk, according to a witness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case stems from two incidents in May and June in which witnesses confronted Wasserman as she allegedly vandalized the mural. She was &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2025/08/08/woman-suspected-of-vandalizing-palestinian-mural-charged-with-hate-crime-battery\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;charged last August&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natalie Figueroa was riding her bike June 13 when she saw Wasserman vandalizing the mural and confronted her, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/06/18/pilsen-mural-attack\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;she previously told the Sun-Times&lt;/a&gt;. An argument turned physical when Wasserman allegedly struck Figueroa with a metal pole, leaving her with two black eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A passerby called 911, but Wasserman had walked away by the time police arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wasserman was also seen throwing trash at the mural May 9, according to another witness. She allegedly tried to choke that witness with a scarf before leaving the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wasserman was arrested June 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plea deal also requires Wasserman to complete 200 hours of community service and to enroll in an education program discouraging hate crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These felony hate-crime convictions were necessary to ensure the legal record reflected the truth of what occurred,” said Farah Chalisa, an attorney representing the victims. “Too often, attacks against Palestinian and allied communities are minimized, while expressions of solidarity are villainized. Here, finally, the legal record archives Wasserman's conduct candidly, as bias-motivated violence intended to harm and intimidate these communities.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mural, representing the solidarity of Mexicans and Palestinians, was painted in May by Taqi Spateen, an artist from Bethlehem in the West Bank. It was commissioned by the Mural Movement, which aims to transform communities through art and activism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-8a0000\" name=\"image-8a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/39a7217/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1149+0+108/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F9f%2F88b4c3fd44768f0601e2c2c6d258%2Fdscf9638.JPEG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3d444ac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1149+0+108/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F9f%2F88b4c3fd44768f0601e2c2c6d258%2Fdscf9638.JPEG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0eb0d94/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1149+0+108/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F9f%2F88b4c3fd44768f0601e2c2c6d258%2Fdscf9638.JPEG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A photo of the Palestinian man on the mural before it was vandalized\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0eb0d94/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1149+0+108/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F9f%2F88b4c3fd44768f0601e2c2c6d258%2Fdscf9638.JPEG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5cfff3e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1149+0+108/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F9f%2F88b4c3fd44768f0601e2c2c6d258%2Fdscf9638.JPEG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0eb0d94/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1149+0+108/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F9f%2F88b4c3fd44768f0601e2c2c6d258%2Fdscf9638.JPEG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A photo of the Palestinian man on the mural before it was vandalized&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Students and parents questioned whether the school had allowed itself to be used to promote a political agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McMahon’s Education Department has made many controversial moves, including stripping funding from programs that support Black, Latino, transgender and disabled students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some disagree with these policies and approaches and feel like they are harmful to the community at large,” he said during a Thursday news conference at the school. “With that being said, do we cancel and hide the opportunity for her to come to our school? Or do we have an opportunity to show her who we are and welcome her into this space?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About half the students at the school did not attend the assembly with McMahon, which Muzikowski said was “perfectly fine” with him.

The school’s walls feature posters of prominent Black figures like Booker T. Washington and Barack Obama, as well as a Black History Month bulletin board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McMahon’s “History Rocks!” tour has been controversial as it’s made its way across the country. According to the Education Department, the tour is intended to “showcase examples of high-quality history and civics instruction that bring American principles to life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is being done in conjunction with 40 conservative organizations, and many question whether the history and civics education being promoted is inclusive and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just last week, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/29/fairfield-announces-then-abruptly-cancels-school-visit-by-linda-mcmahon/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;an elementary school in Connecticut canceled a History Rocks! visit by McMahon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after parents raised concerns about the politicization of the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After visiting Chicago Hope Academy on Thursday, McMahon went to Genoa-Kingston High School in northern Illinois &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.northernpublicradio.org/illinois/2026-02-05/department-of-education-tour-polarizes-students-at-genoa-kingston-high-school\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;where she attended a History Rocks! event with Erika Kirk&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the widow of Charlie Kirk, who cofounded the campus activism group Turning Point USA. Kirk was considered a leading voice for young conservatives before he was shot and killed last year. The Genoa-Kingston event drew about 50 protesters, according to reporting by Northern Public Radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a short press conference after the Chicago Hope assembly, McMahon said she was happy to be invited to the Genoa-Kingston event by Kirk, saying that Turning Point USA was one of the first organizations to promote free speech and the idea that it's important to “present both sides.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McMahon also said she thinks people in Connecticut “misunderstood” what the tour was about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's totally nonpartisan,” she said. “It is just absolutely about civics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Hope assembly was not open to the media. But Muzikowski said that McMahon gave a short speech where she brought up some historical facts about the United States and Illinois. She didn’t mention any figures, but mentioned things like that Illinois was the 21st state to join the union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then led a trivia competition between students that McMahon described as “kind of like 'Family Feud.'” Muzikowski said the Education Department staff gave him some questions to ask, but he added some of his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love the principal. I thought Ike was a lot of fun,” McMahon said. “The kids seemed to have a great rapport with him, with the teachers and with this family-based school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muzikowski said that when he agreed to McMahon’s visit he did not realize it would be so controversial. What followed was days of intense conversation. He held town hall meetings with students and parents and said he was surprised at how opposed a lot of them were to the visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we learned is that it is very easy to point the finger and label and judge and be disappointed internally for our own community,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said in the end he thinks it was a good learning experience for students about rubbing shoulders and listening to people, even if they disagree.&lt;/p&gt;",

Schools that refused faced immediate loss of federal funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois and many other states declined to sign, arguing the department's requirements were vague and legally unsupported, Raoul said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raoul joined attorneys general from California, Massachusetts, Minnesota and New York in filing a lawsuit on April 25, 2025, challenging the funding threat as unconstitutional. The states argued it violated the Spending Clause, Appropriations Clause and separation of powers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A related lawsuit by the American Federation of Teachers successfully vacated the April 3 certification request. Friday's agreement ensures that relief applies to Illinois schools and prevents the administration from withholding funding based on the disputed conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protected funding supports programs for low-income and rural students, special education services, teacher recruitment and training, English-language learner programs, services for foster care children and students without housing and career technical education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia joined the agreement, including Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Michaels used the photo in an online sale for the spray paint from June to early January, the lawsuit states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are obviously appalled that a 'store for artists' would sue an artist, who was simply trying to protect his work,” Nickel’s lawyer, Jeff Gluck, said in a statement to the Sun-Times. “He clearly never authorized Michaels to use his artwork and their ridiculous lawsuit is nothing more than a transparent attempt to discourage and intimidate Mr. Nickel, a beloved Chicago-based artist, into dropping his legitimate claims against them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gluck said Nickel has received an “outpour of support from the global artist community” after the lawsuit was filed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Michaels could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit claims Nickel’s artwork was not copyrighted until January, when Nickel sent the store the cease and desist letter. Michaels removed the artwork from its website after receiving the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michaels is seeking a declaratory judgment from the court that it has not infringed Nickel’s property rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed in Texas, where Michaels is headquartered.&lt;/p&gt;",

He was taken into custody by immigration authorities the next day, and he’s since been detained at the Clay County Justice Center in Brazil, Indiana, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney Michael Adler filed a petition Monday in the Southern District of Indiana challenging Espinoza Martinez’s&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;detention. Adler told the judge his client lived in Chicago for 30 years and worked for the last decade at his brother’s construction company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He has never been convicted of a crime,” Adler wrote. “He has never given anyone reason to doubt his character.

It followed a picture of Bovino and read, “2k on info cuando lo agarren,” “10k if u take him down,” and “LK … on him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man who received the message, Adrian Jimenez, testified that he understood it to mean “$2,000 when they grab him … $10,000 if you kill him … Latin Kings are on him.” Jimenez said he immediately turned it over to authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bovino served as the face of the immigration campaign launched by the Trump administration in Chicago last year, Operation Midway Blitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors also pointed to separate messages Espinoza Martinez sent to his brother, including “10k for his head” below a picture of Bovino,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;along with “dead or alive” and “s--t serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But defense attorneys Jonathan Bedi and Dena Singer pointed out that no money exchanged hands. No weapons were purchased. And social media “is riddled with things that aren’t true,” Singer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You should demand that there’s other evidence before you can convict somebody for this,” she told the jury.&lt;/p&gt;",

Jan Schakowsky’s seat in one of the most competitive races the state has seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates include Kat Abughazaleh, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, state Sen. Laura Fine (D-Glenview), Phil Andrew, Bushra Amiwala, state Sen. Mike Simmons, economist Jeff Cohen, State Rep. Hoan Huynh, former federal prosecutor Nick Pyati, veteran Sam Polan, civil rights attorney Howard Rosenblum, Evanston resident Bethany Johnson, union organizer Justin Ford, Patricia A. Brown and Mark Arnold Fredrickson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;So what?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seat in this very blue congressional district hasn't been open since 1999. Before that, the seat was represented by Sidney R. Yates, who held it for 24 terms — with a two-year gap for an unsuccessful Senate bid in 1962 against Everett Dirksen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rocio Cleveland, John Elleson, Paul Friedman and Mark Su are running in the Republican primary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What does a U.S. representative do?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives vote on federal laws, advocate for their districts and work to secure federal funding and other resources for constituents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why is U.S. representative a powerful position?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of Congress vote on laws that affect all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who are the candidates?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-738b98b0-03ad-11f1-b777-9dc4e6d28ffc\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kat Abughazaleh is a former journalist and progressive content creator who announced her bid even before Schakowsky announced her retirement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bushra Amiwala, a Skokie School Board District member, is a 28-year-old self-described “homegrown fighter putting people first.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phil Andrew survived a mass shooting in Winnetka in 1988, then became an FBI special agent specializing in negotiations, as well as a gun control advocate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daniel Biss is a former mathematician, state representative and state senator who was elected Evanston mayor in 2021.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patricia A. Brown is a lifelong Evanston resident and previously worked in health care, education, corporate America and the American Bar Association.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jeff Cohen, an economist&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; says the country needs a “revenue-neutral income and child care bill” that would modernize both credits to allow for monthly or quarterly payments without changing eligibility criteria or benefit levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Laura Fine, D-Glenview, has served in the state Senate since 2018 and previously served in the Illinois House.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mark Arnold Fredrickson is an IT consultant and attorney.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Justin Ford is a health professional and union organizer. He calls his “signature” issue a federally mandated four-day work week.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hoan Huynh is the first refugee and Vietnamese American elected to office in Illinois. He is serving his second term in the Illinois House, representing the 13th District.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bethany Johnson worked on Angus King’s U.S. Senate campaign in Maine in 2018, and helped to fight for an LGBTQ+ rights ordinance in Missouri.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sam Polan served in the U.S. Army as a captain and later worked for the Department of Defense. His platform includes expanding mental health care and reproductive freedoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nick Pyati is a former Microsoft strategist who believes AI, clean energy and new technology are reshaping work and life.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Howard Rosenblum is a Skokie native and for 33 years has litigated for the civil rights of people with disabilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mike Simmons was appointed to the state Senate in 2021 and was elected in 2022 to represent the 7th District.

Robin Kelly's decision to launch a bid to replace outgoing Sen. Dick Durbin set up a contentious 10-person open race in the 2nd Congressional District Democratic primary, including a political comeback attempt by former Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook County Commissioner Donna Miller is leading fundraising in the crowded field. State Sen. Robert Peters, D-Chicago, has the progressive backing, including a glowing endorsement from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. Rounding out the field are state Sen. Willie Preston; Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Board member Yumeka Brown; Adal Regis, who worked in Kelly’s district office; management consultant Eric France; attorney Patrick “PJK” Keating; Toni C. Brown and Sidney Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;So what?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly has held the seat since 2013, and the primary winner in the heavily Democratic district will be favored to replace her. They'll face the winner of the Republican primary; Mike Noack is the only Republican on the March 17 ballot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What does a U.S. representative do?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives vote on federal laws, advocate for their districts and work to secure federal funding and other resources for constituents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why is U.S. representative a powerful position?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of Congress vote on laws that affect all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who are the candidates?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-92ae8742-fd39-11f0-a56e-bf18f95939f2\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jesse Jackson Jr.&lt;/b&gt; represented the 2nd Congressional District from 1995 until his resignation in 2012. He left Congress amid mental health issues and, ultimately, federal charges lodged against him for misusing his campaign funds. He says he wants to prioritize getting Chicago its third airport to help boost economic development in the south suburbs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donna Miller&lt;/b&gt; is serving her second term as 6th District commissioner in the Cook County Board. She is pushing for Medicare for All, maternal health and reproductive justice and for good jobs and lower costs for working families, among other policy priorities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robert Peters&lt;/b&gt; was appointed to the state Senate in 2019 to succeed now-state Attorney General Kwame Raoul. A former community organizer, Peters sponsored the state measure that ended cash bail in Illinois and passed laws to raise the minimum wage. Peters wants Medicare for All and to abolish ICE.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Willie Preston&lt;/b&gt; has served in the Illinois Senate since 2023 and is the chair of the Legislative Black Caucus. Preston is pushing for more trade schools in the district.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yumeka Brown&lt;/b&gt; served as village clerk of Matteson and currently serves as a Metropolitan Water Reclamation District commissioner. She said she’s running because she believes in environmental justice, clean water and safe streets, affordable health care, jobs that pay a living wage and strong public schools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adal Regis&lt;/b&gt; said he helped secure millions in federal funding for local governments, small businesses and nonprofits while working in Kelly’s office. As director of strategy at a Chicago-based environmental nonprofit, he leads clean energy and climate resilience initiatives in neighborhoods that need investment. He says that experience would equip him to advocate for affordable housing, public safety, environmental equity and economic opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eric France&lt;/b&gt;, a strategist, says the state must extend existing public transportation and expand airports to support the movement of cargo and passenger traffic. He also supports expanding affordable housing in the district and pushing federal down-payment assistance programs for first-time buyers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Patrick \"PJK\" Keating&lt;/b&gt;, a Flossmoor resident, is a trial and appellate lawyer. He calls himself a “commonsense Democrat” and says Democrats and a functioning Congress “must be defined by what we as the majority are for, not just who we are against.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sidney Moore&lt;/b&gt;, who worked on several political campaigns, also ran for Illinois Secretary of State in 2022. He says he’s not a career politician and isn’t run by party politics or special interests. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Toni C. Brown&lt;/b&gt; is on the ballot but does not have a publicly available campaign website or social media pages. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-b60000\" name=\"module-b60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Illinois 2026 primary election schedule&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feb. 5&lt;/b&gt;: Early voting and vote by mail begins&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 1&lt;/b&gt;: Online voter registration ends, but voters may register in person at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.elections.il.gov/VotingAndRegistrationSystems/EarlyVotingLocationsSearch.aspx\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;election authority and early voting sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 12&lt;/b&gt;: Deadline for online and posted applications to vote by mail; in-person requests for absentee ballots may be made through March 16&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 17&lt;/b&gt;: Polls open for Primary Election Day from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 31&lt;/b&gt;: Deadline to return absentee ballots postmarked on or before Primary Election Day&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Regardless of whether he beats the Patriots on Sunday at Levi’s Stadium, Darnold won the argument. He’s too good to deny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when presented with the opportunity to gloat, he didn’t bother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t really come down to that for me,” Darnold said. “It’s always just been about putting in the hard work every single day. And sometimes hard work and dedication and all the hours I put in in the offseason leads to this moment. That’s the mindset I’ve had my entire career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly eight years after the Jets drafted him third overall, with back-to-back Pro Bowl selections and now a Super Bowl appearance, the league still seems somewhat unsure what to make of Darnold. A win Sunday would clarify it once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after a breakout performance with the Vikings last season, his market in free agency was modest. The Seahawks got him on merely a three-year deal, and his $33.5 million average pay ranks 18th at his position. That contract says they weren’t fully convinced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, he proved that his superb 2024 season with the Vikings was an arrival, not an aberration. He ranked in the top 11 in passer rating (99.1), yardage (238.1 per game) and touchdown passes (25) this season. He threw 14 interceptions, but had just four in his last nine games, including none in the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In wins over the 49ers and Rams that got the Seahawks to Super Bowl, Darnold totaled 470 yards, four touchdowns and a 122.4 passer rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His teammates are happy to flex on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wide receiver &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/05/super-bowl-lx-features-elite-wide-receivers-in-seahawks-jaxon-smith-njigba-patriots-stefan-diggs\"   &gt;Jaxon Smith-Njigba&lt;/a&gt;, the league’s Offensive Player of the Year with 1,759 yards and 10 touchdown catches, said this week, “I wouldn’t be in this position without him.” Receiver Cooper Kupp showed up to one media availability this week wearing a t-shirt that read, “I (heart) Sam Darnold.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter if others still aren’t sold. The Seahawks are all in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From year to year and week to week, just one of the more resilient people I’ve ever been around,” said quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko, a former Bears assistant. “Whether he’s coming off a big win or a loss, his want to get back to work and his commitment to each step of the preparation and his enjoyment of that sets him apart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of Darnold’s low points typically would’ve been the end for a quarterback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jets were done with him after three seasons in which he threw almost as many interceptions (39) as touchdown passes (45), had a 78.6 passer rating and went 13-25 as a starter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Panthers’ trade for him in 2021, in which they gave up second-, fourth- and sixth-round picks still is laughed about in league circles as an embarrassingly bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And after beginning his career in the Jets’ trademark dysfunction, he encountered more of the same with the bumbling Panthers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Darnold finally had control of his future as a free agent in 2023, he wisely went to the 49ers as a backup for respected coach Kyle Shanahan. He then furthered his football education by taking a backup job with the Vikings under another quarterback guru in Kevin O’Connell, and the door opened for him when rookie J.J. McCarthy missed the season with a knee injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, he took off. Now everyone sees the potential he always knew he had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest thing is to believe in yourself,” Darnold said. “I’ve always had confidence, and I’ve learned. I learned a ton from the mistakes I made early in my career, and that mindset got me to this point.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-bc0001\" name=\"list-bc0001\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears, subTitle=null, pagination=[{body=[Next Page], href=?p=2, _template=/link/Link.hbs, contentId=null, pianoSectionSlug=null, target=null}], stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, _styledTemplate=/page/list/PageListH.hbs, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, items=[{type=Image, category=[{items=[Bears]}], publishDate=February 06, 2026 04:28 PM, wordCount=838, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, isFeatured=false, media=[{alt=Bears quarterback Jim McMahon works the crowd during Super Bowl XX., image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/21/b1/2e6fd36b243a575bc0bb67e781a3/ap942601127815.jpg, width=2498, height=1906}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/21/b1/2e6fd36b243a575bc0bb67e781a3/ap942601127815.jpg, width=2498, height=1906}}], authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/steve-greenberg, media=[{ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=258097893_10227367806079844_1724022405929237952_n.jpg, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/11/58/fc94fb4e49bebd891825a398c8d4/258097893-10227367806079844-1724022405929237952-n.jpg, width=750, height=750}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/11/58/fc94fb4e49bebd891825a398c8d4/258097893-10227367806079844-1724022405929237952-n.jpg, width=750, height=750}}], bio=[{items=[Steve Greenberg is a sports columnist at the Chicago Sun-Times.]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, name=[{items=[Steve Greenberg]}], jobTitle=[{items=[Reporter/columnist, sports]}]}], description=[{items=[Chicago has loved the Shufflin’ Crew for so long, the whole thing is far past the point of becoming a caricature of itself.

If those materials were not made available to prosecutors, it could compromise their discovery obligations under federal and state law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson issued the Ice on Notice executive order following public outrage over fatal shootings by &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/01/30/suburban-teen-brothers-on-ice-watch-in-minneapolis-this-is-nothing-like-chicago-this-is-so-much-worse\"   &gt;federal immigration agents in Minneapolis&lt;/a&gt;. The order directs police to preserve evidence and document alleged abuses by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents for potential prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At his weekly news conference, Johnson defended the order as a necessary response to what he called \"rogue, reckless behavior of federal agents.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I wish I did not have to use executive authority to provide protection for the residents of the city of Chicago because the president of the United States of America has declared war on our city,\" Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Neill Burke said this week that she was reviewing the mayor’s order after Johnson “falsely claimed” that her office had backed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor said he plans to use a 30-day rule-making period to address O'Neill Burke's concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill Burke's office is currently prosecuting &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/01/30/new-body-camera-footage-shows-aftermath-of-ice-officer-allegedly-attacking-activist-near-chicago\"   &gt;ICE Agent Adam Saracco&lt;/a&gt;, who faces a misdemeanor battery charge for allegedly attacking a protester at a gas station in Brookfield while off-duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's attorney said federal and state law limits prosecutors' ability to charge on-duty federal agents except in narrow circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the memo, Loizon said the state's attorney's office has drafted a protocol for handling cases involving federal agents and shared it with Chicago police, Illinois State Police, the Cook County Sheriff's Office and state's attorneys from around Illinois for review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We will be sure to share it with the mayor's office when appropriate so we can meaningfully collaborate in the name of public safety,\" Loizon wrote.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

On Sunday, she sat down with Sun-Times and WBEZ reporters &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/03/marimar-martinez-shot-border-patrol-chicago-speaks-out-after-good-pretti-deaths-i-am-their-voice\"   &gt;to recount the events of that day, her recovery and her advocacy&lt;/a&gt;. In the wake of the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, there's been increased scrutiny of federal agents' use of force, and Martinez's first-hand account is more relevant than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How did you get the photo?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez sat for a two-hour interview with reporters Jon Seidel and Adriana Cardona-Maguigad. I was tasked with making still images as Zubaer Khan filmed video. The wide-ranging conversation covered sensitive topics including the shooting itself, the government labeling Martinez as a \"domestic terrorist\" and the impact on her family. There were a few moments when Martinez became visibly emotional. I was concerned that she would be too drained by the end of the interview to sit for additional portraits, but she obliged. I had to quickly rearrange the room for photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tried a few frames in the dark recording studio, relying on the overhead lighting Khan used to shoot video. I even tried to incorporate the blue strip lighting that ran along the walls to add some visual interest with color. Cardona-Maguigad was watching nearby and gently asked how the lighting was in the space. I was grateful for the question because it allowed me to acknowledge that the environment was challenging and gave me an opportunity to ask Martinez for just a little more of her time in order to try a new set up. I took her to the lobby area filled with bright light and positioned her next to the window. Half of her face was illuminated and the other fell in shadow, which felt tonally appropriate for the story — she's experienced a dark, traumatic event, but now stands as a beacon of defiance against injustice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Technical details:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-c99fb892-fdf8-11f0-8afa-b3d074ccce9f\" style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: border-box;

The order also instructs federal agencies to promote sales to individual owner-occupants through first-look policies, disclosure requirements and anti-circumvention measures, according to the White House.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measures are a part of Trump's wider push to make everything from groceries to homeownership more affordable. As home prices rise, so has the median age of first-time homebuyers. The National Association of Realtors says the median age of first-time buyers in the U.S. is 40 years old — the oldest it has been in U.S. history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the glaring issue is that the order doesn’t block all purchases from institutional buyers, said Frank Manzo, an economist at the Illinois Economic Policy Institute. These buyers are often private equity firms that own thousands of homes and rental units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Institutional investors, especially in the single-family rental market, typically purchase their properties in cash,” Manzo said. “Or, if they're financing it, they're using private sources, and all of that is outside ... what the executive order would address. Ultimately, the executive order doesn’t have that much teeth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order’s impact would also be smaller in Chicago, where the share of homes owned by investors is below the national average. Data from Redfin puts the national share of homes owned by investors at 17% as of third quarter 2025, the most recent data available. In Chicago, that figure is 13%, according to Redfin. Investors purchased nearly 2,400 homes in Chicago during the third quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Investor activity recently experienced rapid growth following the COVID-19 pandemic, and that really reduced the supply of homes that were available for individuals and families to purchase,” Manzo said. “Investor purchases have declined in the last two years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While investor purchases have been declining nationally, Manzo said that’s not the case in Chicago and Illinois, where home prices and valuation continue to rise above the national average. Investors purchased more than 1,000 homes in Chicago between the second and third quarters last year, according to Redfin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But investors are only one factor contributing to the state’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/housing/2025/06/25/a-new-study-finds-illinois-needs-to-build-45-000-homes-for-five-years-to-address-its-housing-shortage\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;housing shortage&lt;/a&gt;. Manzo published a study in June 2024 that examines Illinois’ housing shortage and ways the state could fix it; the study's co-author was Robert Bruno, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and director of the school’s Project for Middle Class Renewal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study says Illinois’ housing shortage has been driven by several demand, supply and regulatory factors, including investor ownership of properties. According to the report, the buying of homes by investors is raising home prices by reducing the number of properties available on the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manzo said investors tend to purchase homes in “trendier” Chicago neighborhoods on the North and West sides, where younger people may be looking to rent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some argue these investors do good by rehabbing properties that might otherwise fall into foreclosure, in turn increasing the rental supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But too often, Manzo said those investors raise rents, skimp on maintenance and turn homes into vacation rentals, thereby reducing housing options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Investor activity has been found to degrade affordability for young households, in particular, who are seeking starter homes,” Manzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research from &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.housingstudies.org/blog/Examining_Role_Corporate_Landlords/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;DePaul University’s Institute for Housing Studies &lt;/a&gt;in 2024 found elected officials of cities, towns and villages in the Greater Chicago region had similar concerns about institutional landlords in their communities. Elected officials said their challenges with institutional owners included reaching property owners about maintenance issues and code violations; a possible decline in homeownership; and limited government resources for regulating the landlords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manzo said more steps could be taken to address institutional landlords, such as congressional laws to help spur new construction and buy backs of homes from investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data is just really clear that the people of Illinois want to own their homes, because our homeownership rate is consistently higher than the nation’s, and that's despite the fact that we have kind of really high &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/11/17/cook-county-property-taxes-analysis-treasurer-maria-pappas-downtown-south-west-sides\"   &gt;property taxes&lt;/a&gt;,” Manzo said. “We have a high homeownership rate, and we need to find ways to give the people what they want, which is more homes.”&lt;/p&gt;",

His season was “absolutely” an underachievement and, as a whole, he hasn’t played up to his potential since the Bears drafted him ninth overall two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I truly believe I can be one of the best in the league, so until I go out there and do that, I’m not satisfied,” Odunze told the Sun-Times while promoting Sharpie ahead of the Super Bowl. “That’s what I’m working toward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You go through certain circumstances during the season like injuries, but in this league, you either do or you don’t. And I’m looking forward to doing a lot more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odunze is being a little hard on himself by not taking into account that he was hurt and that the Bears were a total mess offensively his rookie season and were learning a new offense under coach Ben Johnson this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s correct, though, on the expectations. Anytime a team drafts a wide receiver in the top 10, it’s projecting him as an elite difference maker, and the Bears have rarely taken that swing. Before Odunze, their most recent top-10 picks at the position were Kevin White in 2015, David Terrell in 2001 and Curtis Conway in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odunze did emerge as Bears’ the No. 1 receiver and led them with 44 catches for 661 yards and six touchdowns before getting hurt, but he has yet to assert himself in the top tier of the NFL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was 48th in catches, 28th in yards and 11th in touchdown catches at the time. Seahawks star Jaxon Smith-Njigba already had more than double Odunze’s yardage, and three of the players ahead of Odunze in yardage were wide receivers from his draft class or the 2025 rookies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he returned for the playoffs, his foot still was in “rough” shape and the injuries hindered his conditioning. He caught two passes for 44 yards in each of the games and had a maddening drop near the goal line early in the divisional-round loss to the Rams that still bothers him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson’s vision for the passing attack isn’t to concentrate on one star like the Bengals did this season with Ja’Marr Chase getting 185 targets. He wants a balanced attack for quarterback &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2025/08/31/why-do-so-many-people-hate-bears-qb-caleb-williams-he-answers-exactly-that-question\"   &gt;Caleb Williams&lt;/a&gt;, and the Bears seem to have the pieces for that between Odunze, DJ Moore, Luther Burden III, Colston Loveland, Cole Kmet and their running backs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a game-breaking deep threat is a necessity, as shown by the teams playing in Super Bowl LX on Sunday with Smith-Njigba and the Patriots’ Stefon Diggs, and Odunze must be that for the Bears to open things up underneath. He certainly has the capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foot injuries will slow him down this offseason, but the upside is they won’t require surgery and he doesn’t anticipate missing any practice time. Odunze expects to be running again by early March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not terrible,” he said. “It is going to delay it because I want to be perfectly healthy before I get into intense training, but it’ll be worth the wait.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Odunze is back on the field, the pressure is on to live up to what he and the Bears believe he can be. They drafted him to be Williams’ go-to weapon, and while there have been glimpses of how dangerous that can be, the Bears need that combination to be at full force next season.&lt;/p&gt;",

One of the other quarterbacks might be in Maye’s shoes a year from now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams never can be counted out of anything. The Commanders’ Jayden Daniels outplayed them on his way to winning Offensive Rookie of the Year and going to the NFC Championship Game last season. The Broncos’ Bo Nix has thrown more touchdown passes than any of them and missed out on a shot at Maye in the AFC Championship Game after he broke his ankle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an early chapter of what should be an epic saga. Maye is the main character for now, but even he makes no assumption it’ll stay that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We’re all trying to get to the same stage and get Super Bowl wins,’’ Maye said. ‘‘It just so happened that I got here first. But those guys are great players, and we’re going to have a lot of great matchups down the road.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A record six quarterbacks were selected among the top 12 picks in 2024, matching the six picked in the first round of the historic 1983 class that included John Elway, Dan Marino and Jim Kelly, and four have established themselves in the league.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams, Daniels and Maye were the top three picks, in that order, and Nix went 12th. They all have at least one playoff victory and look like good bets to get contract extensions when they’re eligible after next season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Already, you can see this draft class is making some noise,’’ Maye said. ‘‘Props to how strong our class was and props to us for putting work in to be game-changers and prove our worth to these franchises.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Penix went eighth to the Falcons and J.J. McCarthy 10th to the Vikings, but both are on shaky ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what happens Sunday, this season belonged to Maye. For all of Williams’ heroics and Nix’s steadiness, Maye is definitively in front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He led the NFL with a 113.5 passer rating, which was 20-plus points ahead of anyone else from his class. He threw 31 touchdown passes (third in the league) and only eight interceptions and was fourth in the league at 258.5 passing yards per game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Two main things: One was the humility to want to be coached and invest in the process and master the offense in its entirety, and [two was] also being a good leader in his own way to his teammates,’’ said Patriots assistant Thomas Brown, who was the Bears’ interim coach after Matt Eberflus was fired last season. ‘‘Drake is built in every aspect to be a great leader. He understands who he is and how to communicate with guys.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown, by the way, wasn’t able to track Williams closely this season, but he said he saw some of those ‘‘off-the-wall, outlandish throws he made.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 2024 picks, Williams was second to Maye in passer rating (90.1), touchdown passes (27) and passing yards per game (231.9). Nix had an 87.8 passer rating and 25 touchdown passes and threw for 231.2 yards per game, and Daniels played in only seven games because of injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams has been good enough in his first two seasons to warrant a wait-and-see view of the 2024 class. This is nowhere near the conversation that hounded Mitch Trubisky as Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson soared; it’s merely a snapshot of where things stand at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maye and Williams are friends and fans of each other. Williams, who called it ‘‘a pretty badass class,’’ said in October he enjoyed watching Maye flourish and didn’t get caught up in comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maye said during Super Bowl week that seeing Williams’ stunning throws was nothing new because, ‘‘He’s been making those since high school. His game translates to any stage.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maye and Williams had turbulent rookie seasons, then found stability under new coaches. The Patriots hired Mike Vrabel and veteran offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, and the Bears brought in Ben Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the quarterbacks ascended, so did their teams. The Bears jumped from 5-12 to 11-6, won the NFC North and made it to the divisional round of the playoffs. The Patriots had been even worse at 4-13 and flipped that to a league-best 14-3 alongside the Broncos and Seahawks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the 2024 class proves to rival the 1983 class, the king will be crowned by the number of Lombardi Trophies, not by sparkling statistics or goosebumps-inducing highlights. Marino far exceeded Elway in yards and touchdown passes and is considered by many to be more talented, but Elway reigns because of his two Super Bowl victories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s how the score ultimately will be tallied, and it’s the only thing the Bears, Patriots and the other teams cared about when they drafted these quarterbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Maye can upend the Seahawks and become the first quarterback in the class to get a ring, the pressure on Williams and everyone else will rise.&lt;/p&gt;",

Don’t use that word.) “Reset?” “Purge?” “Tank?” “Tear down?” “Demolition?” Yeah, that last one. That fits perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So this is (supposed to be) the Bulls’ version of “here we go!” Of their six-year vision coming to fruition. Their big plan finally making sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s my responsibility to make this better and move this organization into something sustainable at the highest level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those words had the nerve to exit Arturas Karnisovas’ soul Thursday after his “Rains of Castamere” trade-deadline day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What have the last six years — this “experiment,” their “process” — all been for if this is the grand finale? Is there a vision that only Karnisovas sees where this is going to be better or at least vastly different than before?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New faces. New place. Same s---. Different toilet paper. These Bulls ain’t loyal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood that is dripping from the knife you just pulled out of your back is not proverbial. Because the betrayal that inserted it isn’t. If nothing else can be said about what the franchise just did, there’s no other way to frame it for anyone who has stuck with this team’s insanity over the last decade but to call it what it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While resting in the 10th spot (again!) for the infamous play-in at the moment, rarely do you see a team lowering the bar for itself. Subtraction by addition. So many guards, so little bigs. Superstar-less and All-Star-less again. One bad decision after another. The Bulls act like they’re allergic to aprons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that’s Anfernee Simons, Collin Sexton, Jaden Ivey, Josh Giddey, Matas Buzelis, Isaac Okoro, Tre Jones, Jalen Smith, Zach Collins, Yuki Kawamura, Ousmane Dieng, Guerschon Yabusele, Rob Dillingham, Leonard Miller and Mac McClung. And somehow Patrick Williams and Noa Essengue remained. (Insert shrug emoji here.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is coach Billy Donovan going to do with this roster that he didn’t with the rosters before this? What are AK and general manager Marc Eversley going to do to make better with this new “juggernaut” they created with seven new players that they couldn’t with the last? What is Michael Reinsdorf, as Lord Walder Frey, going to do to cover up the blood he is solely responsible for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They just helped the Celtics, Pistons, Hornets and maybe the Knicks (who got Jose Alvarado in return for the Bulls trading Dalen Terry to New York) in the East. (And they damn sure helped the Timberwolves in the West, sending them Ayo Dosunmu.) These are teams they’re going to have to beat at some point to get to that place their mouths keep telling us they want to go. Years away from making the Finals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it all a move to get Zion Williamson? Put themselves in a stronger position to maybe get Giannis Antetokounmpo over the summer? Fill the stadium seats on the regular for Ja Morant games? Or are the Bulls purposely trying to beat the Grizzlies and Kings to the title of “worst franchise in sports history” that the Clippers once held? Or, like they’ve been for the last six years and counting, is the answer somewhere in the middle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Nuggets coach Michael Malone, whom Karnisovas worked with for five years in Denver, is big on “understanding the why” in life and in life in the NBA. As we sit through this latest activity by the Bulls in addition to their public responses to the new chaos they just caused, we still do not “understand the why.” We don’t even know if they understand their own why. We do understand this African American proverb via Cottage Grove, though: “For whatever reason this is going down, I ain’t gotta go down with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cap projection beginning at $166 million, the Bulls have somewhere in the neighborhood of $86 million in cap space to mess around with this summer. With about 400 second-round picks. (OK, 14. Same thing.) For what? For naught? What’s the why? Draft capital is only as good as those making the decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No player available in free agency is going to put the Bulls over the hill they’ve let the franchise die on. The front office’s “clean house” screams keep getting louder by the hour. The one question that overrides all of the questions asked in this column is: &lt;i&gt;What now becomes the Bulls’ identity?&lt;/i&gt; Not in the form of a player, not in style of play, but in the form of a composite of a team, in the functionality and aptitude as an organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Painful Era is over. Enter the numbness. The don’t care anymore. The End game. With these latest moves seeming like the culmination of their six-year plan, betrayal becomes us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

That's really important to me, and if they weren't supportive of me playing, I wouldn't do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm lucky to have little girls that want their dad to do what he loves to do... but [my family] is not something I'm willing to lose over a game that I love to play. If they weren't behind me in that decision, I don't care how good I played that year or the year before. We'd have some real talks.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stafford, 38, goes into next season sixth all-time in passing yards (64,516) and could pass Aaron Rodgers if Rodgers retires. He also is seventh in touchdown passes (423) and could pass Philip Rivers if he retires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is 13-10 all-time against the Bears, including the playoffs, with 35 touchdown passes and 24 interceptions.&lt;/p&gt;",

The Patriots and Rams were knotted 3-3, and John Murray, as director of the Westgate SuperBook, had an update to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a VIP booth inside the SuperBook that Sunday, Feb. 3, 2019, the executives of Westgate Resorts awaited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the previous few days, Murray had informed them that the fewer points the better for the book’s bottom line, regarding side and total bets, and hundreds of props.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Eventually, I had to tell all the guys who run this company, in from Florida,” Murray said. “We do want it to be boring, I had told them, but not &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; boring. Because if nobody scores a TD, we would lose X.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to former SuperBook boss Jay Kornegay, X represented about seven figures on one prop. “No Touchdown” paid 500-to-1 dividends, around 100-1 on other variations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Murray admits to feeling some anxiety during that walk and talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was nervous,” Murray said. “It was my first Super Bowl as director, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He finally exhaled with seven minutes left, when Pats tailback Sony Michel scored from two yards out. New England won 13-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We got to a point where we just wanted someone to score a touchdown,” Murray said. “Those executives were all excited because the game was so boring. They’re thinking, ‘We’re doing great!’ And we did do great on props.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was a little tense, but it was a fun one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prestige&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, as the newly minted vice president of race and sports, Murray spent his first Super Bowl sitting behind the most prestigious desk of the world’s most eminent decades-old legal sportsbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in 40 years, Kornegay, having stepped aside to become a SuperBook consultant, did not monitor an NFL title game’s developing liability status behind a book’s counter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It became the SuperBook, as the Las Vegas Hilton, under Art Manteris. At Caesars Palace in 1986, he begat the Super Bowl prop craze by offering 20-1 on William “The Refrigerator” Perry scoring a touchdown against the Patriots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That got whittled to 2-1 by kickoff. The Fridge, of course, scored to boost the Bears’ lead to 44-3 in Super Bowl XX. Manteris penned his 1991 book, “SuperBookie.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, he took over running the many Station Casino books that ring the valley. -Kornegay left the Imperial Palace and made the SuperBook synonymous with Super Bowl props.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Jay raised the bar here,” Murray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 days, patrons have sifted through 50 pages of SuperBook props.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murray, 42, is aware of his desk’s prestige, saying, “Many people tell me that this is probably the best office of any sportsbook in this city.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kornegay oversaw promoting Murray from book manager to director to executive director to vice president. Twenty years ago, at that initial interview, Kornegay hired Murray on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“John’s very intelligent; that’s a first impression I had,” Kornegay said. “He had a very balanced demeanor and a personality for the position that we were hiring for. Let’s just say, when I hired John, it was a no-doubter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obviously, 20 years later, we made the right decision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Putt master&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murray grew up in McLean, Virginia, as a hoops fan of Georgetown, his pop’s college. John studied English at West Virginia, but he began betting sports at Gonzaga Prep, alma mater of Bears quarterback Caleb Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just being honest,” Murray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Ryan Howard belting home runs by the bushel at spring training in 2006, Murray and three college pals wagered on a 40-1 offshore futures ticket on the third-year Phillies slugger to lead the majors in homers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howard hit 58, beating Red Sox masher David Ortiz’s 54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murray and his buddies had made a deal to barnstorm Vegas with their winnings if it hit. They stayed at Luxor, explored the Strip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John had heard of the SuperContest, so they ventured to the SuperBook to watch the Patriots beat the Vikings 31-7 on Oct. 30, 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first time I set foot in this book,” Murray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’d return after graduating, still holding Howard profit. He planned to get a gig, stay two or three years and have some fun, return to Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murray hasn’t left Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Jay kept promoting me,” he said with a touch of his characteristic dry humor. “I got stuck out here because of him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lives by the fifth hole of the Las Vegas Country Club — across the street from the SuperBook — where his putting often shines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a round in which Murray sank everything, former UFC champ Aljamain “Funk Master” Sterling called him “Putt Master.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like Kornegay, Murray will traipse the SuperBook grounds, discussing games and wagers with customers as if he were one of them, which he was not so long ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;He’ll never walk alone&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When his Gonzaga Prep rugby team toured the British Isles one summer to play matches in England, Ireland and Wales, Murray experienced an epiphany of thirst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking pints of Carlsberg, nectar out of British kegs and taps, in pubs with his teammates turned him into an aficionado of Liverpool Football Club because the brewery sponsored the Reds’ uniforms. They’ve become an obsession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murray went to Anfield, Liverpool’s hallowed grounds, two years ago for the last home match of Jürgen Klopp’s career. He returned a year ago, when Arne Slot capped his first season as Reds gaffer with a Premier League trophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has hotel arrangements in Budapest and Madrid, sites for the next two Champions League finales, should Liverpool advance that far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dude,” Murray said, “I’m a planner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will relish this summer’s World Cup with special zeal because the previous tournaments were in Qatar (during the fall), Russia, Brazil and South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not just having a World Cup, but a World Cup in this time zone will be huge, very significant for every sportsbook,” Murray said. “Hopefully, the U.S. can make a run.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Super roar&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Super Bowl, however, is Murray’s favorite event. Two weeks of buildup, big bets and exotic wagers, then whoosh, Super Sunday seems to fly by in several heartbeats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the rest of the city’s books at Seattle -4½ for Super Bowl LX, Murray and his team made it Seattle -5, at -108 (or risk $108 to win $100), to lure New England cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By midweek it hadn’t happened, as 75% of the money and two-thirds of the tickets were on the Seahawks. But the SuperBook sliced its price to -105 for the weekend, so perhaps Pats supporters were waiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not exactly a bad plan,” Murray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, a colleague sat with him in his office to watch the Eagles trounce the Chiefs 40-22 when late Kansas City points chewed into profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New England was 18-0 entering Super Bowl XLII, Murray’s first writing tickets. With 35 seconds left, Giants quarterback Eli Manning threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to Plaxico Burress to give the underdog Giants a 17-14 triumph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s still the loudest I’ve ever heard this book,” Murray said. “There have been a lot of big moments, big events and plays here, but I’ve never heard a roar like that one.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

That isn't true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAGA is a bit of a moving target, but a recent Economist/YouGov &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econTabReport_8FWGyNz.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;poll &lt;/a&gt;found that only 24% of all voters described themselves as \"MAGA supporters\" and a perhaps surprisingly low 54% of Trump voters so identified. In other words, a minority of the voting public and only a little over half of the GOP is Trump's loyal base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://beyondmaga.us/media/ot0no1ro/beyondmaga_desktop_011926.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;new survey&lt;/a&gt; from More in Common, an international pro-democracy organization (I sit on its global board), offers a more granular look at Trump 2024 voters and provides further evidence that MAGA is definitely not half the country. They canvassed over 18,000 Americans over eight months. In looking over their findings, the group categorized the Trump voters into four clusters: MAGA hardliners, anti-woke conservatives, mainline Republicans and the reluctant right. Their conclusion? Trump voters were a coalition, not a cult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-7f0000\" name=\"module-7f0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MAGA hardliners:&lt;/b&gt; These are the people we usually picture sporting red hats. They are highly religious, 91% white, mostly over 45 and less educated than other Trump voters — only 24% hold a college degree or higher compared with 29% of total Trump voters. They have little trust in institutions, believe that a sinister cabal runs media, business and politics, and are not averse to their leader ignoring the Supreme Court or other constitutional checks to \"get things done.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lamentable majority (60%) of the hardliners say their man should serve a third term. (In case you're wondering, yes, they do know the Constitution imposes a two-term limit, because it was included in the question.) Nearly three-quarters think we should \"use our military to round up everyone who came to the U.S. illegally, put them in mass detention camps, and deport them.\" Seventy-four percent say voting for Trump is part of \"living out my faith,\" and 94% (75% strongly) believe that God intervened to save Trump's life in Butler, Pennsylvania, so that he could make America great again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This crowd cannot be trusted with power. They are conspiratorial, cultish, dismissive of constitutional limits and punitive toward their perceived political enemies. There isn't much good to say about them except this: They represent only 29% of Trump 2024 voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anti-woke conservatives:&lt;/b&gt; This next group is a little different. Among Trump voters, they are the least likely to say their faith determines their votes (14% versus an average of 27% among all Trump voters), but also the most hostile to Democrats. This is an alienated bunch who believe (91%) that wokeness is a very serious problem plaguing America. So, while that was enough to put them in the GOP column, only 33% agree that Trump should punish his opponents. This group represents 21% of Trump's coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mainline Republicans:&lt;/b&gt; Making up some 30% of the coalition, these are the most likely to say that they are Trump supporters and Republicans equally, the least likely to say America is in decline (39% versus 58% of all Trump voters) and somewhat cool (43%) to ignoring court orders. Fifty-four percent of this group, compared with 76% of all Trump voters, agree with the statement \"The woke left has ruined American education, news, and entertainment.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reluctant right:&lt;/b&gt; Of this final cohort, only a scant majority even identifies as Republican, and they were the most likely to say they voted for Trump, because he seemed \"less bad\" than Kamala Harris. This group, which represented 1 in 5 Trump voters, was the most likely to say they were ashamed of what happened on Jan. 6. Only 28% of this group favored rounding up undocumented immigrants and deporting them (compared with 52% of all Trump voters). Twenty-five percent of the reluctant right say they have doubts about or regret their vote entirely. That's a start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardline MAGA group believes all of the worst things, but it's worth noting that some of the policies associated with Trump 2.0 have far less support among the rest of the coalition. Only 31% support deporting immigrants to third countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Economist/YouGov poll found further fissures, suggesting that Trump voters are not a monolith. Asked whether they supported increases or decreases in spending on Medicaid, for example, which the GOP cut by $1 trillion in last year's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" only 28% of Trump voters favored decreasing spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump's base is hate-filled and dangerous, but it is not the majority. Nor is it half of the country. As a January &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2026/01/29/confidence-in-trump-dips-and-fewer-now-say-they-support-his-policies-and-plans/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Pew poll &lt;/a&gt;found, only 27% of respondents say they support all or most of Trump's policies, down from 35 % when he took the oath of office. Nearly all of that decline is attributable to Republicans. The erosion is proceeding fast, and based on the small size of the cult, there is plenty of room for more.

Could it be this low, this fast?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only an estimate. But the non-Hispanic Black population for Chicago was just over 700,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDT1Y2024.B03002?q=B03002:+Hispanic+or+Latino+Origin+by+Race&amp;amp;g=160XX00US1714000\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;2024 American Community Survey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And, if you consider the margin of error — plus or minus 18,589 — Chicago’s Black population could be anywhere from about 721,000 to 684,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been researching and writing about Chicago’s Black population loss for several years, so I wasn’t shocked to see that the trend is continuing. But there was something about seeing that figure so close to sinking below 700,000 that shook me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-8f0000\" name=\"module-8f0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1980, the city’s Black population reached its peak at just under 1.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means Chicago is on the verge of having seen its Black population plummet by half a million in a span of less than 50 years — essentially, more than 10,000 Black folks every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other American city can make that claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intractable problems that have contributed to the decline seem insurmountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oasis of jobs that attracted millions of African Americans from the South, during the first and second waves of the Great Migration, to cities like Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York City and Philadelphia has long since dried up. In Chicago, deindustrialization’s greatest losses were witnessed on the city’s South and West sides. Manufacturing had been a stable source of employment for Black Chicago. No other industry has replaced the jobs and steady wages that went away once the factories closed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result: Chicago's Black unemployment rate was 14.5% in 2024, census data shows, the highest among the nation's largest cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after court rulings were issued to end restrictive covenants, and federal laws were passed to end housing discrimination, inequities and injustices remain. White flight, bank loan denials and other forms of disinvestment continue to take money out of the pockets of Black residents by diminishing their property values. Meanwhile, predatory lending, red light and speed camera tickets and disproportionate property taxes suck up much of what’s left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result: median Black wealth in Chicago is $0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we’re not completely powerless to invigorate growth and development in Black Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some things over which we have much more control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can start by building or creating more places to live in Chicago’s Black spaces. We haven’t done a good job thus far of maintaining the housing stock in Black neighborhoods. For instance, majority-Black census tracts were the only spaces in Chicago to witness an overall decline in housing units between 2000 and 2020, according to my analysis of census data. In addition, those Black areas saw a decline in occupied housing units and an increase in vacant units during that span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are ways we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago’s city-owned land inventory includes nearly 13,000 properties that are already owned by the city. Nearly two-thirds of those properties are located in Black communities, which have, collectively, seen a decline of more than 90,000 Black residents over the past decade, my analysis shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the city gets at least 5,000 reports of vacant or abandoned buildings every year. Since 2019, the largest  number of complaints have been for buildings in Roseland, West Englewood, Englewood, West Pullman, Austin, Greater Grand Crossing and Auburn Gresham. Those communities were all ranked among the top 10 for Black population loss over the past decade, according to my analysis. Collectively, those communities lost more than 60,000 Black residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, in a previous job, I had a chance to sit in on a meeting with planning and development officials from Chicago, San Francisco and New York City. They were exchanging ideas, challenges and best practices. After the Chicagoans droned on about how tough it was to create housing and development opportunities here, their out-of-town colleagues expressed jealousy. They marveled at all the available land in Chicago on which to build and create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where we saw shortcomings, they saw opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can slow — and maybe even reverse — the city’s loss of its Black communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have the land. We have the vacant property. Now, we just need the will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/alden-loury\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Alden Loury&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is data projects editor for WBEZ and writes a column for the Sun-Times.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-ab0000\" name=\"module-ab0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Anything less, they claim, \"places the burden entirely on taxpayers, leaving labor completely off the hook.\" That’s a tired narrative by an organization that undermines its own credibility every time it targets workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newsflash: City workers, who by law must live in Chicago, pay taxes just like every other Chicagoan. We’re the city that works only because of the dedication of those who keep it running every day. City residents want emergency responders, firefighters, police officers, librarians, snowplow drivers, garbage collectors, 311 operators and public health workers on the job to provide the essential services they rely on, not on furlough or in the unemployment line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the Civic Federation continues with its rhetoric that lacks facts and honesty. City workers are already doing more with less: Since 2019, the city’s payroll has shrunk by more than 500 employees. Contrary to claims made in the Sun-Times article, this budget did eliminate vacant positions and grant-funded jobs in human services and public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our part, unions representing city workers have repeatedly suggested efficiencies that could save money without harming services, such as reducing the top-heavy ranks of management employees. And through the joint Labor Management Cooperation Committee, we regularly evaluate options to contain the city’s health care costs without reducing benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Civic Federation is a leading voice in the coalition of \"no\" when it comes to revenue-raising ideas. It’s time the organization contributes something substantive to the conversation around the future of our city instead of trotting out the same shallow talking points against workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bob Reiter, president, Chicago Federation of Labor&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-a00000\" name=\"module-a00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give us your take&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Send letters to the editor to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Johnson Institute for Sustainability and Environmental Justice&lt;/a&gt;: a high-efficiency, all-electric, sustainably powered hub for learning and research. It would be named for the group’s founder, who is considered the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/environment/2025/03/07/hazel-johnson-environmental-justice-chicago-trump-epa-cheryl-johnson-altgeld-gardens\"   &gt;mother of the environmental justice movement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would host workforce development and training, youth programming, offices for local organizations and community meeting space. It would be a community anchor — an engine for health, opportunity and local power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People for Community Recovery applied for an Environmental Protection Agency&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/dfe6854c5ec740f59ec02bd3ae80e22c__;!!NO21cQ!HS0JFvO_Ey7MlXBRELSBYaphJLEuW8GdNdQtQwhq1-IwPqMFnq5zo-HHniB_CpUGsV82uMHwym6yTg$\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt; Community Change Grant&lt;/a&gt; that would have made this vision real. This program was designed around a simple, overdue premise: communities closest to harm should be closest to the solutions, and they should have the resources to lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the Trump administration clawed back almost &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/17092025/trump-stops-29-billion-in-grants-for-environment-climate-renewable-energy/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;$29 billion &lt;/a&gt;from communities for environmental health and climate projects like the Community Change grant, abruptly, with no meaningful explanation. Our application was left in limbo when the administration halted the grant program and funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immediate impact is obvious. Our project is now forced into a scramble to look for funding elsewhere. But the deeper impact is harder to quantify and more dangerous. This kind of action shatters public trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a community-based organization wins a grant, it is months and years of work, building partnerships, meeting requirements, crafting a project plan, aligning contractors and engaging residents. This is the work Chicago and other communities performed to secure grants that were abruptly rescinded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it is not just happening in Chicago. We are seeing grant clawbacks and funding freezes across the country. When commitments are revoked, the damage spreads. It delays projects. It drains capacity. It chills future participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If leaders want a solution, here it is: fund community-led investments and keep your word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clawbacks do real harm and cause long-term mistrust in partnering with government. They take away once-in-a-generation opportunities to turn environmental sacrifice zones into healthy, thriving neighborhoods. The path forward is not complicated. The EPA must keep its promise, protect awarded grants and invest in the solutions communities have already built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cheryl Johnson, executive director,&amp;nbsp;People for Community Recovery&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Melissa Lin Perrella,&amp;nbsp;chief&amp;nbsp;equity and&amp;nbsp;justice&amp;nbsp;officer,&amp;nbsp;Natural Resources Defense Council&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Outraged over Epstein files &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call me old-fashioned, but I remember a time when if the news came out that you were allegedly having sex with minors or palling around with someone who did, it would ruin your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More Epstein files have dropped. More proof that the president, along with &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/epstein-lawyer-alan-dershowitz-makes-bonkers-excuse-when-cornered-on-role/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Alan Dershowitz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-gates-elon-musk-epstein-files-what-documents-show/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt;  were OK with what was taking place. The Department of Justice just dumped millions of pages of documents, videos and images from the Epstein investigation — the largest disclosure under the new Epstein Files Transparency Act. Donald Trump's name appears&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/31/politics/new-documents-trump-epstein\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt; hundreds, by some counts even thousands&lt;/a&gt;, of times. Even &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://variety.com/2026/film/news/jay-z-harvey-weinstein-pusha-t-epstein-files-1236647297/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;rapper&lt;/a&gt;s Jay-Z and Pusha T are mentioned alongside &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/30/elon-musk-epstein-files-island-visits\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these documents — released by our government — allege is the stuff of conspiracy websites, and yet, here we are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There used to be a social contract. A rickety, duct-taped one, sure, but a real one. If you were exposed as someone who exploited kids, you were a goner. You didn't spin it. You didn't lawyer your way out of it. Your career was over, your name became radioactive, and the country agreed that some lines could not be crossed. Now, these false prophets of prosperity remain bulletproof, even if the sitting president is accused of horrific stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DOJ says the material does &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/01/epstein-files-todd-blanche-deputy-ag\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;not provide grounds for new charges&lt;/a&gt;. Trump and his allies have pushed back against how the material has been interpreted and reported, at times threatening litigation, while the DOJ maintains that some public claims lack credibility even as it confirms it will not pursue further charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And nothing is happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not even headline news. It's a side note against Iran, Greenland, tariffs, Venezuela, Israel and Ukraine. All by design, while a cabal of elites keeps it business as usual. Republicans stay on brand with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. Liberals are spineless, masters of the performative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, a name appearing in documents is not the same thing as being accused of a crime or a conviction. But when the name of a sitting president appears again and again in files tied to the most notorious sex-trafficking operation of our lifetime, the correct response is not a shrug. If it were baseless, demand a full, transparent investigation. Think that would ever happen on Trump's watch?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where are the Democrats? Where are the Republicans who clamored for these files when it was about Bill Clinton?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subpoena power. Independent prosecutors. Criminal referrals that aren't DOJ puppet strings. Anything short of that isn't justice, it's performative theater. And we're exhausted watching this horror show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Robert Dean, Austin, Texas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hard pass on school vouchers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gov. JB Pritzker should opt Illinois out of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/01/28/pritzker-still-deciding-if-illinois-will-join-federal-program-that-funds-private-school-scholarships\"   &gt;Donald Trump’s voucher program&lt;/a&gt; tucked in his \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public education is an invaluable institution under federal attack. This federal school voucher program, like the dismantling of the Department of Education and massive federal funding cuts, is designed to weaken a key component of American democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many generations, our taxpayer dollars have supported public schools that are open to all children and are the backbone of communities and civic life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private schools pick their students and operate without public transparency or accountability. When students leave a public school, the public school loses per student federal and state funding, but still must cover fixed costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our governor should focus on supporting the quality of our wonderful lllinois public schools that today educate the vast majority of K-12 students. Public schools provide curriculum and services that respect all children's backgrounds and respond to individual families' needs and aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should not open our state to an untested new federal tax credit that could funnel billions of public dollars nationwide not only to private religious schools and home schools, but also to services providers seeking profits without guardrails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus on our children and the quality of their education, not the adults who are jockeying to pocket the tax credit dollars. This voucher program does not serve children well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ann Courter, former Oak Park Elementary District 97 school board president, Oak Park&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dying art &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump announced he is closing the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2026/02/02/trump-kennedy-center-shutdown/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;two years&lt;/a&gt;. Three years may be more practical as his presidency will have finished, and he will be able to devote more time to his love of the arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, the center needs a major update, so it can reach the standard required to have the Trump name attached. The timing may be advantageous, as it is now almost empty and rarely used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same logic could be applied to most film theaters, as a quick examination of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2026/01/31/chicago-draws-small-but-complimentary-audience-for-critically-panned-melania\"   &gt;sales&lt;/a&gt; in many regions and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/katie-miller-makes-bonkers-new-bid-to-prop-up-melania/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;bulk ticket buying&lt;/a&gt; allegations tied to the \"Melania\" documentary indicate they are close to empty rarely used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dennis Fitzgerald, Melbourne, Australia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Celebrate disabled community &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we approach Valentine’s Day, a season often focused on romantic love, our community in Maywood is preparing for a different kind of celebration — one centered on the inherent dignity and value of every human life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Feb. 13, my church, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.launchingpadww.net/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;The Launching Pad Worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, and the nonprofit &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.west40.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;West40&lt;/a&gt; will join hundreds of organizations globally to host \"Night to Shine,\" a prom night for people with disabilities. Sponsored by the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://timtebowfoundation.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Tim Tebow Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, this event, at West40's Intermediate Service Center in Maywood, is more than just a dance; it is a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For too long, the disabled community has been overlooked or pushed to the margins. \"Night to Shine\" flips that narrative. When our 130-plus guests walk the red carpet to the sound of cheering crowds, they won't just be attendees — they are and will be kings and queens. In a world that often defines value by productivity or perfection, this night reminds us that every individual is an image-bearer of God, deserving of celebration, honor and royal treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We invite Proviso Township and others to join us in this mission of inclusion. Whether through volunteering or simply shifting how we view our neighbors with special needs, let’s make sure the light from this one night shines throughout the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thomas Clark, pastor, The Launching Pad Worldwide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can’t scare off corporations, rich folk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding millionaire and corporate tax proposals, I am not a millionaire. I am a middle-class resident living on the Northwest Side. Wealthy residents and corporations should pay their fair share of taxes. However, it's another thing to punish them. This will ultimately lead the wealthy and corporations to leave Chicago and Illinois. They will take with them their money and their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John Petersen, Belmont Heights&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CPS students: Protest on own time — not class time &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Public Schools students should not be allowed to miss school to protest anything. CPS students have some of the lowest test scores while Chicago has the highest taxes in the nation, all while the Chicago Teachers Union wants pay raises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s great that the students want to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/02/02/hundreds-of-cps-students-walk-out-of-school-to-protest-trumps-deportation-campaign\"   &gt;stand for something&lt;/a&gt; and be heard, but not while the hardworking citizens of Illinois are burdened by ever-increasing property taxes that are linked directly to CPS. Teachers and principals should keep their political views out of the classroom, and any who allow or encourage students to skip class should be held accountable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Joe Ferro, Garfield Ridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

I don't know if they think I am senile, but they seem to think I must cater to their every whim. Most of them are self-centered, thinking only of themselves. They borrow money from me, and sometimes I let them know it is a loan. Other times I give it to them and tell them that it is a gift. Loans are to be paid back. When it's given to you, it's yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One daughter, \"Marie,\" borrowed a large sum of money and agreed to repay it in installments. She paid me back a portion of the money I had loaned her. When the next installment was due, she claimed her first payment was three times more than it had been. When I called her on it, she insisted she had given the higher amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love all my family, but I don't intend for anyone to play me. Marie has given me no further payments, and the borrowing has stopped. When Marie tried to get in my face and talk down to me, my wife of 30 years let her know she wasn't to talk to me that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Marie has stopped speaking to us and has accused my wife of blocking her email, calls and texts. (That did not happen; I blocked them.) I just cannot see how a grown child could treat her parents the way we have been treated. I am deeply hurt, and I cannot seem to get past it. Your thoughts? — &lt;i&gt;OLD MAN IN THE MOUNTAINS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR OLD MAN:&lt;/b&gt; Your hurt is understandable. Not only is your self-entitled daughter a deadbeat, but she's also disrespectful. You treated her with kindness, and not only did she not repay the money you loaned her, but she attacked you verbally. I hope your other offspring have more character. That said, I don't think blocking Marie's ability to contact you was a wise decision. She may wish to apologize in the future, and you have been preventing that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My wife of 10 years has asked for a separation. She is set on divorce. She feels that, during the last four years since we had kids (2 and 4 years old), I have \"chipped away at her self-esteem and self-worth.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the past two months since our initial conversation, I have started seeing a therapist, gone on antidepressants and joined an empathy group session for men. I now see the hurt and pain I caused due to my untreated depression and negative self-image, and I have committed to change and save our marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I stood by her and supported her through a major depression episode a year ago, and now she wants out. I am still in love with her, but she says that while she'll always love me, she is no longer IN love with me. I'm working on giving her space to heal. What else can I do? — &lt;i&gt;DISAPPOINTED HUSBAND IN MAINE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR HUSBAND:&lt;/b&gt; Ask your wife if she would agree to couples counseling with a licensed marriage and family therapist. Remind her that there are children involved, and even if the counseling isn't successful in healing your marriage, it could benefit all of you in the divorce process and beyond. Whether it will result in you and your wife reuniting is anyone's guess, but it may improve your relationship later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Customers can buy a bottle and uncork it in the restaurant, or they can try a glass with dinner and buy a bottle to take home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menu items range from imported caviar service to sandwiches and seafood. Brunch items include avocado fried egg toast, Georgian cheese bread and brioche French toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many imported items, the business is especially vulnerable to the rapid-fire tariffs Trump has announced, then often pulled back, throughout the first year of his second term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's just so arbitrary,\" said Einhorn, 63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-d50000\" name=\"module-d50000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lush Wine &amp;amp; Spirits&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;About:&lt;/b&gt; Boutique wine and spirit store, as well as restaurant and wine bar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Neighborhood:&lt;/b&gt; Roscoe Village and West Town&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Owners:&lt;/b&gt; Mitch and Cliff Einhorn&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Founded:&lt;/b&gt; 2005&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Staff size:&lt;/b&gt; 15&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Estimated annual sales:&lt;/b&gt; More than $1 million&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since August, U.S. importers of European wines have been paying 15% tariffs. The taxes are typically passed down to consumers in the form of higher prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Trump threatened 10% tariffs — rising to 25% by June — on products from eight European countries unless the U.S. was allowed to purchase Greenland. Shortly after, he threatened 200% tariffs on French wine and Champagne after French President Emmanuel Macron snubbed an invitation to join Trump's new Board of Peace, composed of a group of world leaders, who can pay a $1 billion admission fee for a lifetime membership, with Trump as chairman for as long as he likes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wildly fluctuating tariffs were heartburn-inducing for Einhorn, who said he had orders in transit from France when the 200% tariff was suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a week, Trump backed off on Greenland-related threats and has stopped mentioning 200% tariffs on French imports. But Einhorn said the unpredictability is harmful. He decided to pause further purchases until things settle down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also worries about people whose livelihoods are connected to imports, such as port workers, truckers and retail employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"When you think about how many hands touch a product ... it impacts a lot of people,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn wonders whether the president realizes the downstream harm that such threats can cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"When was the last time he went out to eat and picked up the bill?\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a50000\" name=\"image-a50000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a3622eb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+157/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fad%2Fbf%2F46db2f1a4b57befc478191a76157%2Fbizprofiles-012625-83.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/553af0b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+157/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fad%2Fbf%2F46db2f1a4b57befc478191a76157%2Fbizprofiles-012625-83.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/69fc4e5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+157/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fad%2Fbf%2F46db2f1a4b57befc478191a76157%2Fbizprofiles-012625-83.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The dining area of Lush Wine &amp;amp; Spirits&amp;#x27; Roscoe Village location.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/69fc4e5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+157/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fad%2Fbf%2F46db2f1a4b57befc478191a76157%2Fbizprofiles-012625-83.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1fdcb3b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+157/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fad%2Fbf%2F46db2f1a4b57befc478191a76157%2Fbizprofiles-012625-83.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/69fc4e5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+157/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fad%2Fbf%2F46db2f1a4b57befc478191a76157%2Fbizprofiles-012625-83.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dining area of Lush Wine &amp;amp; Spirits’ Roscoe Village location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food prices have also been another sore spot over the past year, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Einhorn's joys is creating new menu items, like the seasoned and poached scrambled eggs for brunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said ingredient prices remain high and it puts pressure on him to raise prices, which he doesn’t want to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"How do you fix your pricing of products and services to guests? How do guests afford that?\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One triumph in 2025 was getting a building permit to expand the Roscoe Village location at 2232 W. Roscoe St. Sales there were up by 1% over 2024, while the West Town space, 1412 W. Chicago Ave., saw sales dip by 9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Roscoe Village expansion comes with a hurdle — rising construction costs. Einhorn said he's working on a math problem: Will increasing Lush's footprint to four storefronts, with a bigger kitchen, more seating and more store shelves, translate to more customers and revenue?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said owning a small business comes with hassles but it can also be exhilarating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He's working with a vineyard in Washington that's producing a white, a rosé and two red wines exclusively for the store. He’s also working on a longer-term project with a winemaker in France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he's writing new recipes, as always.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn said his goal is to make Lush the best place to buy a bottle and eat a reasonably priced gourmet meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If you stop learning and doing new stuff, you cease to exist,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListA\"

The Hawks were on a 5-0 run when Fisher calmly dribbled down the court, got around her defender and drilled a pull-up three-pointer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a defensive stop, Fisher then assisted on junior forward Elle Knight’s basket to swing momentum back in Libertyville's favor.

Libertyville (22-5) ran a lot of its offense through Fisher. Whenever she has the ball, the defense is loaded up to take her out of a rhythm. But she’s difficult to guard because of her patience, improved shooting ability and passing vision. She dissected Maine South’s defense out of the pick-and-roll, regularly finding her teammates for baskets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 6-1, Fisher is a physical guard. She relished getting into the paint to finish through contact. When Maine South cut the lead to four in the fourth quarter, Fisher drove to the basket and absorbed contact to get to the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though she scored just five points in the second quarter, Fisher's impact was profoundly felt in the second quarter. She was critical in finding her teammates for open shots and layups. Knight is adept at setting screens, and Libertyville has made it an emphasis to surround Fisher with shooters to open up driving lanes or make teams pay for loading up on her drives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lily gets me open a lot,” said senior guard Ella Pawelczy, who scored 11 points and knocked down three threes. “That's like the biggest aspect of my game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pawelczy hit two big threes in the third quarter when Maine South was mounting a comeback to keep them at bay. For Pawelczy, Saturday’s win showed the growth that Libertyville has undergone over the course of the season. In an earlier matchup against Maine South, Libertyville lost 46-28 — Fisher said that they got “whooped.” Pawelczy said that the team was focused coming into today’s game and wanted to start the game strong. As the senior leader, she sets the tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She's our team leader,” Pederson said. “She's had days where she's missed her first three and we tell her. ‘Keep shooting,’ and she has no problem taking that request because she'll keep shooting. She played like a senior today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knight finished with eight points and eight rebounds. Freshman guard Addie Casey finished with four points and five rebounds. Limiting Maine South to one shot on each possession was vital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We struggle with [rebounding], and they like to get second-chance points a lot, so I feel like we got them off the boards and that caused us to get more possessions,” Fisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wildcats have three games remaining in the regular season, two of which are against formidable teams in Glenbrook South and Carmel. Saturday’s win was a validation of the growth they’ve shown this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re gonna have so much confidence going into the playoffs,” Pawelczy said. “We're excited with our seed for sectionals, and we're excited. This win is going to be so important for us, especially for some girls who are newer to the team and to the playoffs.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
