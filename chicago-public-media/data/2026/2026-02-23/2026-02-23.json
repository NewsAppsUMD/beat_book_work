Chaos ensued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giants second baseman &lt;b&gt;Luis Arraez&lt;/b&gt; barehanded the ball on the bounce and tossed it home, prompting Suzuki to race for second. Giants first baseman &lt;b&gt;Rafael Devers&lt;/b&gt; cut off the throw and fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw had stopped in his tracks around third, while Bregman kept his head down and ran. They ended up on the same base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I thought I got a good read off the bat,\" Bregman said, \"and then I should have ran a little bit more with my head up.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giants shortstop &lt;b&gt;Willy Adames&lt;/b&gt; ran over, tagged both runners, and handed the ball to third baseman &lt;b&gt;Matt Chapman&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew that, since I was the trail runner, I was out,” Bregman said. “But I’ve got to do a better job of just staying on the base, clarifying that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two outs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Bregman headed to the dugout, correct in his assessment of the play, Shaw had a brief conversation with third-base coach &lt;b&gt;Quintin Berry&lt;/b&gt;. Shaw stepped off the base, pulling off his sliding mitt and helmet as he talked. Chapman, still holding the ball, tagged him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three outs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what happened,” Adames told Giants reporters. “That’s the beauty of baseball, I guess. Every day, you see something new.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Bregman: “We'll learn from it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Long set to see doctor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs hope that&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/21/how-tokyo-series-prepared-cubs-matthew-boyd-for-wbc-ramp-up\"   &gt; first baseman &lt;b&gt;Jonathon Long&lt;/b&gt;’s left elbow sprain &lt;/a&gt;isn’t serious enough to force him to withdraw from the World Baseball Classic, manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell&lt;/b&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long, a non-roster invitee, sustained the sprain Saturday in a collision Saturday during the Cubs’ game against the Rangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs shut him down from baseball activities Sunday, and he’s set to see a doctor Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He's sore today, and there's some swelling there today,” Counsell said. “But if it's just that, then, we're probably at two, three days [off] here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long was scheduled to leave Cubs camp this week to join Team Chinese Taipei for the WBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gold for USA&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs were gathered in their clubhouse Sunday morning, with the TVs turned to the men’s hockey Olympic gold medal game between the United States and Canada, when Jack Hughes’ “golden goal” delivered the victory to the stars and stripes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were all fired up,” said Bregman, who will be representing the US in the WBC this year. “We were going crazy in the clubhouse when we scored.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can that be replicated in the upcoming baseball tournament?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let's do it, let's go win,” Bregman said. “USA, baby.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

They were joined by Gov. JB Pritzker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes after a year of attacks on federal workers' unions from the Trump administration, including the cancellation of several standing contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group is pushing for higher pay, a higher annual uniform allowance and safety measures for postal workers in the field in this new round of bargaining, which is expected to begin Wednesday, according to Elise Foster, president of NALC Branch 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foster, a 30-year letter carrier from Pilsen, said postal workers often have to save up for years to get adequate uniforms to work outdoors through the city’s seasons. She said many union members are also concerned about safety after mail carrier Octavia Redmond was &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2024/10/01/boy-15-charged-with-fatally-shooting-postal-worker-octavia-redmond-west-pullman\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;fatally shot two years ago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are some of the top key items even just to retain employees,” Foster said. “No one do what we do, the way we do it, that’s why first-class service deserves first-class pay. … We have to deliver ourselves back home to our families.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-ff0000\" name=\"image-ff0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8f6f124/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F2c%2Fe25794db40b1a18d19ecd18f2eb1%2Fnalcrally-260223-05.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18f24ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F2c%2Fe25794db40b1a18d19ecd18f2eb1%2Fnalcrally-260223-05.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8b90d1e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F2c%2Fe25794db40b1a18d19ecd18f2eb1%2Fnalcrally-260223-05.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Gov.

DeJoy agreed to cut 10,000 letter carriers from the 640,000-person force and billions of dollars from the USPS budget&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has also repeatedly called for the privatization of USPS.

Trump said the cancellations were allowed because the agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, play a role in national security, a claim that labor groups are disputing in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump then canceled contracts for three agencies’ unions, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/environment/2025/08/12/president-donald-trump-union-contracts-chicago-us-environmental-protection-agency\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;stripping union protections&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from EPA workers in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a90001\" name=\"image-a90001\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/86ebdd6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5522x3099+0+347/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F69%2F36cbc83a44b08d2baf4e580e5f04%2Fnalcrally-260223-07.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8674589/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5522x3099+0+347/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F69%2F36cbc83a44b08d2baf4e580e5f04%2Fnalcrally-260223-07.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d5749cd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5522x3099+0+347/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F69%2F36cbc83a44b08d2baf4e580e5f04%2Fnalcrally-260223-07.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Workers with the National Association of Letter Carriers rally ahead of bargaining for their next contract Sunday, February 22, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d5749cd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5522x3099+0+347/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F69%2F36cbc83a44b08d2baf4e580e5f04%2Fnalcrally-260223-07.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c6ee9b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5522x3099+0+347/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F69%2F36cbc83a44b08d2baf4e580e5f04%2Fnalcrally-260223-07.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d5749cd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5522x3099+0+347/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F69%2F36cbc83a44b08d2baf4e580e5f04%2Fnalcrally-260223-07.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers with the National Association of Letter Carriers rally ahead of bargaining for their next contract Sunday.

He apologized. On Sunday, he explained why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I just told him, ‘I’m sorry, man,’ ’’ Collins told the media two days before his scheduled surgery Tuesday. ‘‘I thought I had a lot more to give him this year. Unfortunately, between the wrist and the toe, I just didn’t have a chance to show it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I thought I had a really good summer. I was really looking forward to helping the team. It’s been a frustrating year injury-wise as a whole for the team, but individually I knew I had more to give him and felt like the team would have been in a better spot had I not gone through all these injuries.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone, however, is a 6-10 big man who plays with the kind of physicality few on the Bulls do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why the injury to Collins was so detrimental to what Donovan wanted from the Bulls. All the talk last summer and into fall camp was about ramping up the physicality. Then Collins suffered a wrist injury, came back for 10 games to help the Bulls go 6-4, then suffered the toe injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls hoped it would be a small setback, but it never improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We tried to give it every chance we could to get it to heal, and there comes a certain point where you start messing with the outcome of the surgery if you wait too long,’’ Collins said. ‘‘We’re at that point right now. The toe just didn’t get to the point where we wanted it to. We’re at eight weeks now. We just had to kind of bite the bullet and make sure that [even if] we can’t get back this year, we can show everyone that the toe is fine and it’s not going to be a problem in the future.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is important for Collins to show, given that he will be an unrestricted free agent in July. Donovan said Saturday that Collins would be back if things were up to him, but that’s not his call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins, however, made it clear where he wants to play next season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I’d love to be back here,’’ Collins said. ‘‘I feel like I came here last year at a time where I was out of the lineup [with the Spurs], and once I got here I was able to play a lot, got a lot of confidence back, got a lot of rhythm. I think the style we play here is just conducive to the success for myself and that I fit in well. I would love to build on that.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Simons says&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guard &lt;b&gt;Anfernee Simons&lt;/b&gt; missed the Bulls’ game against the Knicks with an injury to his left wrist suffered Saturday against the Pistons. There is no definitive timetable for his return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simons is scheduled to see a hand specialist and to get imaging done Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘He’s pretty sore right now,’’ Donovan said. ‘‘They just want to find out what’s going on in the hand.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Minute men&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guards &lt;b&gt;Josh Giddey&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Tre Jones&lt;/b&gt; and forward &lt;b&gt;Jalen Smith&lt;/b&gt; will remain on minutes restrictions as they recover from lower-body injuries. Donovan said all three are supposed to play less than 24 minutes a game.&lt;/p&gt;",

But as the season has progressed, she's fielded calls from the league's coaches, players, and of course, her Rose BC teammates, who were champions in the league's inaugural season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They all wanted Reese back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"She's Rose basketball,\" teammate Kahleah Copper said of Reese. \"The culture we created was on her back.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reese eventually obliged. She signed a deal with Unrivaled to play the final three games of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rose BC is lucky she had the time. Reese has been everywhere this WNBA offseason, from modeling in the Victoria Secret fashion show to booking acting gigs on the popular Netflix series \"The Hunting Wives.\" Most recently she went on a promotional tour in Australia for her signature shoe, the AR1s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Literally I was in Australia and they were like 'You want to come back?'\" Reese said. \"I was like, 'alright.' Literally I was on the beach last week, and now I'm here.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reese said she hasn't played basketball in months. In her first two games back with Rose BC, it was like she never left. She's averaging her typical double-double, including a 15-rebound performance against the Laces. With that win, Rose BC clinched the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should Rose BC advance to the Semifinals, they'll play at Barclays Center on March 2 in a double-header.&lt;/p&gt;",

Even after the Bulls fell to the Knicks 105-99 for their ninth consecutive loss, their longest skid since January 2019, he wasn’t going to change his stance about competitiveness over development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘From a locker-room standpoint and going in there every single day as professionals that take their job seriously, to go in there and say, ‘Listen, guys, we’re not even trying,’ or, ‘Hey, we’re going to do this, this and this,’ I have not gotten that,’’ Donovan said. ‘‘So he’s not available to play [right now], but let’s see how Jaden [Ivey] can help the group. Or how Rob [Dillingham] can help the group. But our intention is to go out there and try and win every single night. It’s been a challenge from the standpoint of trying to get all these guys on the same page.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a method to Donovan’s madness, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it became obvious the Bulls didn’t have the horsepower to keep up with the Knicks, especially late, Donovan’s feeling is that force-feeding the idea of staying competitive — undermanned or not — is allowing development to happen. That specifically goes for forward Matas Buzelis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s been a lot harder on Matas, but I think in a good way,’’ Donovan said. ‘‘When Coby [White] was here and Ayo [Dosunmu] was here and ‘Vooch’ [Nikola Vucevic] was here, even though [Buzelis] got into the starting lineup, he’s now starting to see the best defenders in the league night in and night out. I think that’s a great opportunity for him to make a jump because he’s starting to learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘The consistency of being able to perform at a really high level against really good defenders and good players is something he’s kind of gotten thrust into, and I do think that because of his makeup and competitiveness, how much he leans into that, that could really help him.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it will someday soon, but it didn’t help late against the Knicks. While Buzelis finished with 15 points, he had two good looks on three-pointers with the game in reach and just more than two minutes left. He missed both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while this latest loss didn’t feature the kind of meltdown the Bulls endured in the third quarter 24 hours earlier against the Pistons, it was another reminder of why the Knicks are competing for a top-four playoff spot in the Eastern Conference and the Bulls (24-34) are doing what they can to improve their lottery odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The culprit was a familiar one. Turnovers gave the Knicks an opportunity to take control of the game in the third quarter, opening a 13-point lead. The Bulls turned the ball over seven times in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To their credit, however, the Bulls came back and made a game of it. But the result still wasn’t good enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We’ve got to find ways to be way more competitive,’’ said guard Josh Giddey, who shot 2-for-10 from the field and scored six points. ‘‘It starts with that first unit. We’ve got to set the tone. But we’ve got to find ways, one through 15, to get this thing on the right track.’’&lt;/p&gt;",

My doctor is recommending that anyone who visits the baby in the first three months be up to date on vaccines (Tdap, flu, COVID and RSV, if age 60-plus). We have decided to follow our doctor's recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of my family members are resistant to getting these vaccines and want us to consider other options, like testing and wearing a mask, which is not as safe. Also, it would be hard for younger kids to do — my niece is 3. Abby, we vaccinated our young children (3 and 5) at the time when our niece was born, as part of what my sister requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am already stressed about this situation and do not want to talk it to death with my family, and I have grown resentful because of it. In the past, I have set boundaries with my family, and most of them have not been understood or received well. Can you offer me some guidance? — &lt;i&gt;EXPECTING IN WASHINGTON&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR EXPECTING:&lt;/b&gt; I am happy to try. When your baby arrives, the responsibility for its welfare will rest mostly on you, the mother. Follow your doctor's medical advice to protect your child. If family members don't want to respect your wishes and do what they must to avoid endangering your baby (as you did for them), realize you can't change their minds, and keep your distance for the first three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; For nearly five years, my adult daughter was a domestic violence victim. My husband and I have done everything to support her freedom and new path. However, during her journey, she claimed that I had been abusive to her as a child. I do not recall any action I took that could be considered abusive, nor does my husband or her siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am finding it difficult to rationalize her recollection of events when she didn't recognize her recent relationship was abusive. Anyhow, I've recommended individual and group therapy. However, I have not admitted to any abuse because it didn't happen. We all feel she's projecting her anger and resentment from this recent relationship onto me because I was honest from the beginning that I saw red flags. We had candid conversations about the offender prior to the separation. But she keeps defending him and blaming me for having inflicted pain and suffering on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please tell me what you suggest I do to resolve this situation, as it is destroying our family. — &lt;i&gt;DUMBFOUNDED IN DELAWARE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR DUMBFOUNDED:&lt;/b&gt; Your daughter appears to be a troubled individual. I'm glad that you suggested therapy. The kind I would recommend would be family therapy, in which every member has a chance to air their \"truths.\" When someone in an abusive relationship attempts to deflect blame from their abuser onto someone else, they may be avoiding reality. A licensed psychotherapist could help put your daughter back on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video gambling is called the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://features.propublica.org/the-bad-bet/video-gambling-addiction-illinois/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“crack cocaine of gambling”&lt;/a&gt; for a reason: The machines are scientifically designed to be maximally addictive. They suck up a person's beer money, followed by their rent money, followed by their grocery money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, the city could get a cut of that, but the rest of it will be gone from the Illinois economy, and the city will be left dealing with the fallout: more people homeless, more children hungry, more theft, more bankruptcies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video gaming machines will make our city poorer. Let's keep them out of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tom McDougal, South Kenwood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Civil discourse&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witnessing relatively civil U.S. Senate candidates’ debates has been reassuring. \"Relatively\" is the key word, but despite a few well-practiced barbs, contentiousness has been muted. That’s good for Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/01/26/senate-debate-illinois-krishnamoorthi-stratton-kelly\"   &gt;three leading hopefuls &lt;/a&gt;want to curb U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.

You are all being incited into a civil war, yet none of it solves any of the real problems that we all face, and tragically people are dying.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political campaigns can turn normally decent people surly in no time. Primary debates bring out the worst in candidates from both parties. We saw this during the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/4/3/18368492/lori-lightfoot-wins-historic-mayoral-race-this-is-amazing\"   &gt;Toni Preckwinkle-Lori Lightfoot&lt;/a&gt; Chicago mayoral race in 2019. Both have been overall thoughtful public servants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats should be poised for success this November — assuming we still have free elections. Well-meaning Democrats have, however, been known to shoot themselves in the foot at the worst times. But if Democrats can buck that trend in Illinois this fall, maybe it’ll catch on in other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jim Newton, Itasca&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trump’s cuts antithetical to American values&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump is executing an assault against areas averse to MAGA ideologies, including Illinois, by targeting their state’s funding and access to aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Gov. JB Pritzker and the city of Chicago over the last year, denied disaster aid to thousands of Chicago residents even though his own administration documented extraordinary damage from two major storms that hit the city last summer, according to records obtained by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/22/trump-refused-to-send-disaster-aid-to-chicago-despite-devastating-damage-00655716\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Politico’s E&amp;amp;E News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"These numbers indicate to me that Illinois and Pritzker are being penalized for standing up against the Trump administration,\" a former official with the Federal Emergency Management Agency told the news outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The October shutdown followed.

Earlier in the year, the Department of Government Efficiency &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/politics/2025/03/03/musks-doge-moves-to-cancel-leases-for-federal-offices-across-illinois\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;set a goal&lt;/a&gt; in Illinois \"to shut down half of the properties that the government owns and cancel half the leases with private property owners.\" This included the Metcalfe Federal Building, which holds the Environmental Protection Agency's Region 5 office and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal actions under the Trump administration have also led to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-appropriations.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/doe-project-terminations-oct-2025.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;cuts in science program&lt;/a&gt;s at colleges, cancellations of clean energy projects statewide and targeted terminations of Department of Energy programs affecting institutions like the University of Illinois and Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional national reporting proves the canceled clean energy cuts that persist today, after the shutdown, are &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://vitalsigns.edf.org/8-billion-in-cuts\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;concentrated in states&lt;/a&gt; that did not vote for Trump during the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students in Illinois deserve a president who sees Chicago as an American city and Illinois as an American state. It shouldn’t matter whether you’re in a red or blue area; instead, aid should be based on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of your vote, because America is defined by its diversity, federal funding in case of emergency should be guaranteed. Simply put, the president shouldn’t be using his power to further political agendas. Such actions are antithetical to the true American democratic spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jayden Lawrence, junior, North Central College&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Milking nondairy options for children&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move to expand access to nondairy milk in &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp/wmfhka-implementation\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;school lunch programs&lt;/a&gt; is a long-overdue step toward healthier, more inclusive nutrition. Millions of students are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy or come from families that avoid animal products for ethical or cultural reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering plant-based milk isn’t radical — it’s practical. These options provide essential nutrients without the saturated fat and cholesterol found in dairy, and they come with a much smaller environmental footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School meals shape lifelong habits. When we normalize plant-based choices early, we teach children that compassion, health and sustainability can coexist on the same tray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a time when childhood health concerns and climate anxiety are rising, modernizing school nutrition just makes sense. Giving students plant-based options empowers families, respects differences  and quietly models a kinder way forward one lunch at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Claude Prescott, West Town&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Warm thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temperatures are rising, and the Cubs and Sox have started playing spring baseball, but it's hard to take any of this seriously when we couldn't even get above freezing recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides, didn't that shaggy varmint in Pennsylvania predict six more weeks of winter? But then optimism always reigns supreme this time of year, and more often than not, it's the only thing that keeps us going when venturing outside takes a true act of heroism. However, as sons and daughters of hearty pioneer stock, would we really prefer it any other way? Hey, don't answer that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bob Ory, Elgin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

She lived into her late 90s. She had an elementary school education, due to dropping out to help the family work in the fields. She lived half her life a stones-throw away from the plantation her elders had been enslaved on before moving with her daughter to the West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my most vivid memories of my great grandmother is her singing. When she was stressed, or taken by joy, or someone needed prayer, she sang. No words, just a familiar hum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Chicago premiere of “Black Cypress Bayou,” a play written by Kristen Adele Calhoun and staged at Definition Theatre in Hyde Park, the family drama centers a Black matriarch, Vernita Manifold, played excellently by RjW Mays. The Manifold family lives in east Texas on land that their family has inhabited since pre-emancipation. When the tensions get high — Vernita sings. Not always words. Sometimes just a gentle hum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part family drama and part murder mystery, Calhoun’s “Black Cypress Bayou” is packed with cultural richness, and trauma, but never feels too heavy. Instead, it feels &lt;i&gt;familiar&lt;/i&gt;. Calhoun is a Texas native herself, and I see in her script the delicate dance between religion and superstition that I saw in my own elders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RatingCard Enhancement\" data-module data-rating=\"3.5\"  data-align-center&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RatingCard-title\"&gt;\n        Black Cypress Bayou\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    &lt;div class=\"RatingCard-content\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-370000\" name=\"module-370000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.definitiontheatre.org/donate?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=10723383570&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACRAu0B75zvJKwZJLcO29eLTf6BKi&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAqeDMBhDcARIsAJEbU9RKEkYTOpWR9Um2D7PRyZFapsqM1ht7yL0kmoIPkU6inOdVcpf-ztAaAuReEALw_wcB\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Definition Theatre,&lt;/a&gt; 1160 E. 55th St.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;When:&lt;/b&gt; Through March 15&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Info:&lt;/b&gt; Tickets from $25&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stage at Definition Theatre is intimate.

Each of the Manifold daughters, LadyBird and RaeMeeka, played by Michelle Renee Bester and Rita Wicks, have secrets of their own. Wicks is a force as the self-proclaimed “medicine woman” who has a side hustle selling weed. Her role is positioned as comic relief, but she also shines moments of seriousness, with a highlight being her recantation of a grisly disposal of a dead body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire 90-minute production takes place deep in the Texas Bayou in a spot where the Manifold clan likes to fish. Designed by Alyssa Mohn, the sparse set included a lawn chair and a basket, but is dominated by a cypress tree. The tree, and its roots, have a contextual meaning in the plot, but the mostly bare stage allows the actors necessary room to occupy the small space without congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The production moves fast but covers plenty of ground. After the richest white man in town is murdered, and Vernita appears to be framed as the culprit, the women in the Manifold family discover truths about each other, and their ancestors, while hunting for the actual killer. In the end, the audience is left with a message of forgiveness, for yourself as well as others, and the importance of letting go of trauma and moving on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the depth of the production, it’s almost hard to describe it as a comedy, but there are so many laugh-out-loud moments between the lessons that it feels like a fair assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Black folks like myself with roots in the South, especially Texas, Mays' performance represents so much of what our grandmothers were like. They were strong, protective (perhaps to a fault), proud women who carried secrets so deep that they feared sharing them would unleash a pain too great for the rest of us to bear. So they carried them alone. Underneath the big laughs and gun-toting Texans, the play reminds us to let go of those secrets so our souls can heal.&lt;/p&gt;",

JB Pritzker’s proposed budget, state funding for the arts would remain essentially flat into the next fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comes at a perilous time for arts across the country. Since beginning his second term just over a year ago, President Donald Trump has &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/arts-culture/2025/05/06/nea-grants-trump-chicago-cultural-events\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;clawed back grants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; given through the National Endowment for the Arts, announced he will &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"http://npr.org/2025/08/12/nx-s1-5500550/smithsonian-trump-review\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;close the Kennedy Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for two years of renovations after taking over control of the venue and called for &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"http://npr.org/2025/08/12/nx-s1-5500550/smithsonian-trump-review\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a sweeping review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Smithsonian exhibitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/31/nx-s1-5334415/doge-institute-of-museum-and-library-services\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;museums&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/arts-culture/2025/04/04/trump-humanities-grants-chicago-illinois-culture-national-endowmen\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;humanities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has also been slashed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the state budget released &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/springfield/2026/02/18/jb-pritzker-budget-proposal-state-of-state-social-media-tax\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;last week&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Pritzker proposed $25.9 million for the Illinois Arts Council, up just slightly from the $25.7 million allocated in fiscal year 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some arts advocates say the flat funding proposal is worrisome in a precarious moment for the sector overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arts Alliance Illinois, the statewide arts advocacy organization, is calling on the General Assembly to increase the arts budget by 20%, which it says would restore state funding levels to where they were 20 years ago. Since then, fiscal support for the arts has dipped on the state level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the state made a big increase in funding for the arts, growing the budget from $15.5 million to $25.5 million annually. Still, the Arts Alliance says the state has not supported the arts the way it did two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're grateful to not see any cuts in a tough budget year, but we’re not where we need to be in terms of per capita funding for arts and culture,” said Claire Rice, executive director of Arts Alliance Illinois. “We really want to see that number higher, particularly since arts funding is such a small fraction of the total budget. Even modest increases in the grand scheme of the budget means a lot to our creative community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Arts Council administers grants to organizations and artists statewide. It also sets public art policies and increases access to the arts in schools. Last year, the agency launched a schools-specific grant program, which provided supplies and materials to eligible schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The council said it saw a 120% increase in grant applications received in 2025. Joshua Davis-Ruperto, the executive director of the Illinois Arts Council, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/arts-culture/2025/01/13/chicago-arts-funding-trump-grants-dcase-individual-artists-program-iap\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;previously told WBEZ&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; direct funding for artists is a priority for his agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When talking to a lot of individual artists, one of the things that I found was that they were getting money for projects, but the problem was they weren’t able to pay their light bills,” Davis-Ruperto said in 2025. “And so, we started thinking about what would general operating support look like for these individuals? Looking at them as entrepreneurs and small businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to receiving dollars from the state’s general fund, the arts council receives federal dollars, which remain steady in the budget forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker has often expressed support for the arts and has said the sector helps drive economic growth in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Government support for the arts is vital to building a more cohesive society,” the governor said in a 2025 video posted online for the Arts Council’s 60th anniversary. “It creates increased opportunities for open expression in our communities, and it supports economic growth and jobs, and above all, we see the importance of embracing cultural diversity, something we pride ourselves on here in Illinois.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, will investment continue? The Arts Alliance says that falling behind in funding could lead to “losing talent and long-term economic growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alliance announced Friday that it will lead a landmark new study to examine “the economic power, infrastructure, and future potential of the Illinois creative economy,” which it plans to publish in June. It comes on the heels of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/music/2026/02/03/chicago-indie-venues-health-metro-ramova-salt-shed\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a report released this month&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the Chicago Independent Venue League that found that nearly three out of four independent live entertainment venues in the city are currently not profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The small businesses and the independent entrepreneurs that comprise our creative economy mean serious business for Illinois,” Rice said. “We need to continue to have the data that demonstrates our economic impact, that really shows our decision makers that these are economic engines in their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is being supported by a public-private partnership, including funds from Chicago’s Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, Illinois Arts Council and the Pritzker Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the city level, Chicago’s cultural affairs department &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/city-hall/2025/11/05/chicago-dcase-cultural-affairs-budget-clinee-hedspeth-kenya-merritt-grants-arts\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;saw a 15% funding cut&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during the latest budget cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bridge the gaps in government and philanthropic support, some nonprofit groups have increased arts grants, like Chicago’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/arts-culture/2025/10/09/3arts-grants-chicago-arts-funding-nea\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;3Arts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which awarded more than $1 million in artist grants last fall, marking a more than $400,000 increase from the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Courtney Kueppers is an arts and culture reporter at WBEZ.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The new fees also apply to license renewals. On Feb. 1, the annual license fee for a charter/sightseeing vehicle increased to $1,000 from $500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some advocates contend higher business license fees are yet another burden for &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2026/02/13/shop-local-campaign-brighton-park-immigration-raids-local-businesses\"   &gt;small businesses&lt;/a&gt; facing economic headwinds, including inflation, tariffs, and higher costs for health care and labor.

Its proposal was endorsed by more than 30 chambers of commerce and business advocacy groups and 15 members of the Chicago City Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Liesl Shurtliff, of Hyde Park, accompanied a friend to city hall to get a $250 regulated business license for a small cleaning business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had done everything right, and the business license was approved. Then they told us the fee was $1,000,” Shurtliff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were shocked, but Shurtliff paid the higher fee for her friend and then fundraised later to cover costs. Her friend is an immigrant who wants to remain anonymous because she fears retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shurtliff said the city’s website listed the license fee at $250, as of Jan.12, but the website was updated later that month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection said it has updated all license fees on its &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"http://chicago.gov/BusinessLicensing\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It also included the new fee information in its January/February newsletter, sent industry notices and informed partners that work with small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shurtliff and her friend had spent months last year preparing her business license application. She said they had no idea the fee was going up and would have applied before Jan. 1 if they had known about the price hike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes to business license fees were finalized late last year during city budget negotiations, Richardson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-3d0000\" name=\"image-3d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4ebbc92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2Fea%2F9a229bc94304961bd104b5c9ca9d%2Fsbac-bizlicensefees-260222-04.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/530b1fa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2Fea%2F9a229bc94304961bd104b5c9ca9d%2Fsbac-bizlicensefees-260222-04.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c591e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2Fea%2F9a229bc94304961bd104b5c9ca9d%2Fsbac-bizlicensefees-260222-04.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Small Business Advocacy Council president Elliot Richardson sits behind a desk\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c591e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2Fea%2F9a229bc94304961bd104b5c9ca9d%2Fsbac-bizlicensefees-260222-04.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/371f00c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2Fea%2F9a229bc94304961bd104b5c9ca9d%2Fsbac-bizlicensefees-260222-04.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c591e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2Fea%2F9a229bc94304961bd104b5c9ca9d%2Fsbac-bizlicensefees-260222-04.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small Business Advocacy Council president Elliot Richardson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there was stiff opposition to raising these fees, doing it during the budget process made it difficult for this issue to gain traction given the other budgetary battles being fought,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher fees took effect weeks after Mayor Brandon Johnson in December announced his &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2025/12/05/mayor-brandon-johnson-cut-red-tape-small-businesses-entrepreneurs\"   &gt;“Cut the Tape for Small Business” initiative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A steep “increase in fees seems like a lot more red tape to me,” Shurtliff said. “It's prohibitively expensive for small service-based businesses — cleaning, creatives, tutors, home-based businesses — many of whom operate on narrow margins. They are barely making ends meet and can’t absorb a sudden $1,000 upfront cost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shurtliff said helping her friend apply for a business license was complicated and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not easy to figure out how to do everything,” she said. “I can’t believe any small business is able to get off the ground without a ton of help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher license fees “incentivizes people to operate without a business license,” Shurtliff said. “Why are we giving so many tax breaks to big businesses and not giving breaks to small businesses?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fees for regulated and limited business licenses hadn’t been changed since 2012, according to a joint statement from the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection and the Chicago Office of Budget Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These adjustments help maintain essential city services while supporting long-term financial stability for the city of Chicago,” the departments said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city analyzed business license fees in other big U.S. cities and found those in Chicago were lower than its peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of our peer jurisdictions charge a much higher rate for the same service, better capturing the true cost to deliver that service to the public,” the departments said. “For example, a typical New York City regulated business license fee is $1,440, an example of the inconsistency between what the city of Chicago charges versus peer cities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richardson said, “We cannot turn back the clock on these fee increases and doubt Chicago politicians will take action to nullify them. They can, however, ensure the additional revenue raised through increased fees and fines are used to improve processes for small businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shurtliff said,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“It helps people make a living wage when they can own a business. We want people to be self-sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Licensed businesses “are on the books. They pay taxes,” Shurtliff said. “It’s to all our benefit to make it as easy and cheap as possible to start one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new fees as of Jan. 1, according to the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection, include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-268b5480-0eb9-11f1-8347-4938c4da6a61\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limited business license: $500 for a two-year license, previously $250&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regulated business license: $1,000 for a two-year license, previously $250&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hotel license: $1,000 plus $2.20 per room for a two-year license, previously $250 plus $2.20 per room&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Commercial vessel license: $600 for any passenger occupancy limit, previously $350 annual license for commercial passenger vessel (tour boat or water taxi) with 20 or more occupancy and $75 annual license fee for under 20 occupancy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shared housing unit registration: $250 per year, previously $125&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shared housing unit operator license: $500 for a two-year license, previously $250&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Application for Commissioner’s adjustment for shared housing units: $360 per application, previously no fee&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Feb. 1, the new license fees include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-268b5481-0eb9-11f1-8347-4938c4da6a61\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Livery vehicle: $1,200 for a two-year license, previously $500 annual license fee&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charter/sightseeing vehicle: $1,000 annual fee, previously $500&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medical carrier vehicle: $600 annual fee, previously $500&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2026/01/15/volumes-bookcafe-wicker-park-close\"   &gt;Volumes Bookcafe in Wicker Park prepares to close&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Others are accusing Democrats of being beholden to interests that will benefit President Donald Trump’s administration — a clearly unpopular issue for Democrats in a primary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems like easy pickings for the types of giant corporate interest that wants to come in and spend,” said Reed Showalter, a candidate in the&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/what-to-know-about-illinois-7th-congressional-district-democratic-primary\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt; 7th Congressional District&lt;/a&gt;. “A few million dollars to buy a seat in Congress is a good deal. And for the rest of everybody who’s playing a grassroots game, that is a very damaging thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showalter is one of several candidates speaking out about the influence of super PACs in this primary cycle — in an unprecedented year with four open congressional seats and a Senate seat open in Illinois.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Israel Public Affairs Committee — the powerful pro-Israel organization — &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/19/rep-jan-schakowsky-withdrawal-donna-miller-endorsement-2nd-congressional-district-aipac-support\"   &gt;is playing a role&lt;/a&gt; in four congressional races in Illinois — helping to boost Cook County Commissioner Donna Miller in the 2nd; former U.S. Rep. Melissa Bean in the 8th; state Sen. Laura Fine in the 9th; and Chicago City Treasurer Melissa Conyears Ervin in the 7th. United Democracy Project, AIPAC’s affiliated super PAC, has spent more than $753,000 directly to support Conyears Ervin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/what-to-know-2nd-congressional-district-democratic-primary\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;The 2nd District&lt;/a&gt; is especially hit hard by super PAC influence, with Fairshake, a pro-crypto PAC funded primarily by Trump megadonors and business partners Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, targeting State Sen. Robert Peters. Fairshake is spending at least $1 million to run anti-Peters ads. And it’s the third Trump-affiliated super PAC to play a role in the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andreessen is the founder and general partner of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz — and a Trump adviser on tech and business policy — and he gave more than $4.7 million to advance the MAGA agenda in the 2023 and 2024 electoral cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affordable Chicago Now!, which is AIPAC-affiliated, is spending money in support of Miller, while the Leading the Future PAC, funded by OpenAI stakeholders, is backing former Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. in the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters’ campaign says Fairshake is targeting him because he voted for crypto state legislation that imposed new rules on digital asset firms. Peters co-sponsored the measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think any time big right wing billionaire donors come into a race, it’s like a jolt,” Peters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters said all three entities “are scared of having an effective progressive champion in this seat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a whole group of really corrupt billionaires who have really close attachment to the Trump administration, who want people who are going to be soft on their issues, and so that means people who are going to be OK with unconditional military aid in [Israel Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu’s war machine,\" Peters said. \"That means people who are going to be OK with the advancement of AI slop and the increase in utility rates. That means people who are OK with the corrupt practices of the crypto bros who have been literally benefiting from the Trump administration and I believe have played a role in Trump’s ability to gain more wealth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junaid Ahmed, a candidate in the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/what-to-know-about-illinois-8th-congressional-district-democratic-primary\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;8th Congressional District,&lt;/a&gt; is a progressive  endorsed by the Sunrise Movement, who is also railing against the influence of super PACs. He’s frustrated that mailers call Bean an “architect of Obamacare,” and reference a 2010 Chicago Tribune article about her role in Obamacare — though in reality the article discusses how she had not made a decision to sign the measure. Bean ultimately did support Obamacare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the part that dark money is doing here. When a voter sees that kind of bombardment, the shouting from the rooftops, that’s a direct impact,” Ahmed said. “And they’re able to by making ads on any topic that polls well — don’t even bring the word AI, don’t even bring the word AIPAC — just focus on what’s polling well and then bombard the voters, and then buy our races.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showalter, a former attorney for the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Justice Department counsel, believes publicly funding elections — and ending Citizens United — would make a huge difference in deflating the power of special interests. He credited New York City's program, in which candidates receive public funding that partially matches what they raise, for helping Zohran Mamdani win the mayoral seat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"You have a matching program where you raise up to a million dollars and it's matched eight-to-one,\" Showalter said. \"That makes a big difference for people who are candidates who are running in a grassroots publicly supported way, so that you don't have to rely on the millions and millions of dollars that can frankly only be deployed by giant corporate interests.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

At issue won’t be building a stadium, but the next step in what the Bears hope is a Super Bowl contender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are four things to watch this week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How will the Bears get under the salary cap?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears sit $4.1 million above the 2026 salary cap of $303.5 million, per Over the Cap, and have until the first day of the league year next month to get under it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the many ways for the Bears to get there, the cleanest would be to cut linebacker Tremaine Edmunds and save $15 million. Edmunds ranked second among all NFL linebackers in interceptions last year but the Bears fared well in his four-game injury absence, with backup D’Marco Jackson winning NFC Defensive Player of the Week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears could also restructure the contracts of receiver DJ Moore, guard Joe Thuney, defensive tackle Grady Jarrett and others to find extra cap space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Moore: Johnson and Poles will have a chance Tuesday to make a clear statement about how they value the receiver after he was part of what quarterback Caleb Williams called a miscommunication on the overtime interception against the Rams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears have praised Moore’s toughness and intelligence for years, but he’s coming off his worst statistical season with the team and has a $28.5 million salary cap hit in each of the next two years. The Bears won’t cut him, but he could be a trade candidate if they decide to go in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What to do at No. 25?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time the Bears arrived at the Combine without either a brand-new head coach or possession of the No. 1 overall draft pick was 2020. This year, then, will be different — picking 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; overall, the Bears will be at the mercy of how the draft board breaks in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears will need an edge rusher and a defensive tackle regardless of what happens in free agency, as well as someone to play left tackle in place of the injured Ozzy Trapilo. They could look to add a safety — or two — if both Kevin Byard and Jaquan Brisker leave via free agency.  The Bears want Byard back. Cornerback could be in play if Nahshon Wright goes elsewhere, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good news for the Bears: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/20/bears-nfl-draft-daniel-jeremiah-network-25-overall-defensive-end-left-tackle-good-spot-no-trade-scouting-combine-ryan-poles-ben-johnson\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;the draft is considered strong — and deep — at offensive tackle, defensive end and defensive tackle.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How about a trade?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade seeds get planted when teams — and agents — gather at the Combine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears solved two of their biggest needs in the days after the Combine last year when they traded draft picks for two guards — Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson — who went on to post exceptional seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the NFL will be searching for clarity about whether Raiders star edge rusher Maxx Crosby will be made available in a trade. Bears quarterback Caleb Williams &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/17/bears-raiders-caleb-williams-maxx-crosby-mutual-admiration-podcast-appearance-trade-nfl\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;appeared on Crosby’s podcast last week &lt;/a&gt;and praised both Johnson and Bears fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;And what about the staff?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears lost two offensive assistants to coordinator jobs this offseason. Declan Doyle took the same job with the Ravens, where he will be able to call plays. Running backs coach Eric Bieniemy became the Chiefs’ coordinator, though he won’t call plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears promoted pass-game coordinator Press Taylor to offensive coordinator and hired Eric Studesville as running backs coach. This week will provide Johnson with the first chance to explain why he hired them — and how he plans to continue the momentum on his side of the ball.&lt;/p&gt;",

JB Pritzker and any of the Republicans vying for a shot against the billionaire Democrat this November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downstate GOP firebrand Darren Bailey lost big to Pritzker four years ago. Video gambling magnate Rick Heidner lost a big chunk of his fortune in regulatory fights with Pritzker’s administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conservative commentator Ted Dabrowski blames Pritzker for “destroying the quality of life in Illinois,” while DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick calls the progressive governor “a menace.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four candidates on the Republican primary ballot for governor all say they’re running to tackle familiar complaints against the state’s Democratic power structure — by lowering taxes, reducing crime and generating economic growth — but their campaigns are personal, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Darren Bailey, former state lawmaker&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Six months ago, if you would’ve asked me if I was running for governor, it was a hard no,” said Bailey, a farmer and former state legislator from Xenia in southern Illinois. “But there was just this welling up in our heart that set in, and I knew that we were being called to do this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stuck to it despite immense personal tragedy in October when a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/10/23/darren-baileys-son-daughter-in-law-2-grandchildren-killed-in-montana-helicopter-crash\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;helicopter crash&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; claimed the lives of his son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaning on his faith — and with encouragement from President Donald Trump, who &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2022/6/25/23183316/darren-bailey-trump-endorsement-igop-governor-primary-election\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;endorsed Bailey’s 2022 gubernatorial campaign&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but not his failed 2024 primary challenge to U.S. Rep. Mike Bost — he stayed in the race because “I'm fighting for my children and my grandchildren and a better future for everyone in Illinois.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey is focusing more on pocketbook issues than the social ones that dominated his 2022 campaign, including protecting gun ownership rights and restricting abortion rights — themes that Pritzker seized on in a backhanded effort to boost Bailey in that GOP primary with ads labeling him “too conservative.” It helped Bailey win &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2022/6/28/23187510/darren-bailey-richard-irvin-pritzker-republican-governors-race-jesse-sullivan\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;in a landslide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, only to get walloped by Pritzker &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/11/8/23448412/j-b-pritzker-declares-victory-over-gop-challenger-darren-bailey\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;in the general election&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by nearly 13 percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-b40000\" name=\"image-b40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c075f3e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5447x3057+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F03%2F72664a70442eb670e5f944186ef2%2F2022primary-25.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4c81bb4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5447x3057+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F03%2F72664a70442eb670e5f944186ef2%2F2022primary-25.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a25fa7a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5447x3057+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2F03%2F72664a70442eb670e5f944186ef2%2F2022primary-25.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"State Sen.

Wade era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Bailey focuses on a word that Democrats are also emphasizing nationwide heading into midterm elections: affordability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't think that people realize the damage that Pritzker [has done] in the last three years, and he's certainly done that, because affordability is front and center today,” Bailey said. “We're hearing it all the time from business and residents, even up here in Chicago — the rents are skyrocketing because of property taxes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our approach will be actually doing something about it,” said Bailey, who has proposed a state-level government spending audit akin to the Elon Musk-led DOGE cost-cutting effort that roiled the federal workforce last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey acknowledged he needs to do a better job appealing to voters in the city he famously branded a “&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2022/9/13/23351525/hellhole-republican-darren-bailey-chicago-john-hancock-center-north-side-downstate-pritzker-governor\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;hellhole&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to meet the people, especially in some of the areas where the crime’s higher,” he said. “We thought we were doing that in 2022, but we discovered later that we didn't do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the often-chaotic federal immigration enforcement campaign in Chicago, Bailey said he’d “create a climate where local state and federal law enforcement work together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said he’d be open to abating or freezing property taxes for a new football stadium. “We cannot lose the Chicago Bears.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey’s lieutenant governor candidate, Cook County Republican Party chair Aaron Del Mar, joined the ticket in an effort to court moderate suburban voters — but Dabrowski says that’s not enough to end Republicans’ eight-year drought from holding statewide office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ted Dabrowski, conservative pundit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He lost by 35 percentage points up here,” Dabrowski said at his Glenview campaign office. “As much as I supported [Bailey], he couldn't win.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div

    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s one reason Dabrowski launched his first run for office after years of punditry with the conservative research and commentary website Wirepoints and the Illinois Policy Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of immigrants from Ecuador and Poland, Dabrowski worked internationally for Citibank before starting a family in the north suburbs and becoming ensconced in the numbers surrounding his home state’s economy, cost of living, crime and population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every time I looked at the statistics, it was like, ‘Wow, what's wrong? Why are we at the bottom of the list on economic growth or population growth, or the other way, high property taxes, all that stuff,’ and I got engaged,” Dabrowski said. “I didn’t see the legislature actually taking seriously many of these issues, and so finally I said, ‘I can either keep complaining, keep exposing it, or get engaged and try to lead and see if we can change this amazing state back to where it should be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dabrowski — who dismisses the eight credit-rating upgrades the state has received under Pritzker as the byproducts of massive federal pandemic relief funding — has amassed a well of support that includes conservative megadonor Richard Uihlein, who supported Bailey last time around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need big change,” said Dabrowski, whose running mate is emergency physician Carrie Mendoza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dabrowski said he’d work to repeal sanctuary policies limiting Illinois law enforcement cooperation with immigration enforcement, accusing Pritzker of “incentivizing these people to go out in the streets and oppose ICE, and that's creating the kind of problems we're seeing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Pritzker, Dabrowski says he’s open to state dollars going into infrastructure to help support a new Bears stadium, but opposed to most other potential subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uihlein has put $250,000 behind Dabrowski, who has put $250,000  of his own money into his run and entered the year with the biggest campaign fund in the race with $1.2 million on hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dabrowski has raised more than $286,000 since October, outpacing the $185,000-plus that Bailey amassed over the same period, while the downstate farmer was burning through much of that war chest. Bailey entered 2026 with about $35,000 on hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Rick Heidner, the slot machine mogul&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaulting himself near Dabrowski in fundraising is Heidner, the slot machine

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s Heidner’s first run for office, but he’s no stranger to politics — or contentious relationships with the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heidner has given more than $1.4 million to a slew of political candidates and causes over the past three decades, including to many of the Democrats he now is quick to denigrate: Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle — and a $2,500 donation to former Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx that he calls “the most regrettable money I've ever spent in my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've worked through the last 50 years with both sides,” Heidner said. “Every single village, every single town, every [ward] that I've gone to in Chicago, everywhere throughout the state, I've always been able to work with everybody, and I have friends on both sides.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div

Ricky Rockets Fuel Center chain and Gold Rush Gaming, Illinois’ third-largest operator of slot machines outside casinos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heidner said he jumped in the race because none of the other GOP hopefuls “had any chance at all” against Pritzker, who’s unopposed in the March 17 Democratic primary and has pumped a cool $25 million into his reelection campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heidner said he’s running to address crime, lower taxes and push for term limits — and that it’s not a personal vendetta against Pritzker, whose administration pulled the plug on a racetrack/casino project that Heidner backed after the Gold Rush founder’s name &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/10/11/20910371/rick-heidner-sandoval-warrant-video-gambling\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;emerged in federal search warrants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tied to a sprawling political corruption scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heidner, who has never been charged with a crime, said the ordeal cost “about half my wealth,” but “I’m over it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Heidner rails against crime and legislation signed by Pritzker that eliminated cash bail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just couldn't stand anymore seeing all the people that are being hurt,” said Heidner, whose running mate is Homer Glen Mayor Christina Neitzke-Troike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He claims the state “could have gotten rid of probably 90% of the worst people” if Pritzker had cooperated with federal immigration authorities, and that a new Bears stadium “would be half-built” by now if he were governor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heidner has hosted fundraisers at his Barrington Hills home for Donald Trump Jr., and he shares President Trump’s baseless claims that mail-ballot voter fraud swayed the 2020 presidential election. Asked if President Joe Biden won: “Absolutely not,” Heidner said. “It was insane to me. I couldn’t believe it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have found no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-0f0000\" name=\"image-0f0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5b7e035/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7372x4137+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2Fd9%2Fdd09c5b840caa6f2e726ad319a1e%2Frepublicanday-081525-21.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f202d17/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7372x4137+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2Fd9%2Fdd09c5b840caa6f2e726ad319a1e%2Frepublicanday-081525-21.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d2d2591/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7372x4137+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2Fd9%2Fdd09c5b840caa6f2e726ad319a1e%2Frepublicanday-081525-21.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick, Republican candidate for Illinois governor, speaks with reporters at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield on Aug. 14, 2025. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d2d2591/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7372x4137+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2Fd9%2Fdd09c5b840caa6f2e726ad319a1e%2Frepublicanday-081525-21.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/78c6eac/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7372x4137+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2Fd9%2Fdd09c5b840caa6f2e726ad319a1e%2Frepublicanday-081525-21.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d2d2591/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7372x4137+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F94%2Fd9%2Fdd09c5b840caa6f2e726ad319a1e%2Frepublicanday-081525-21.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuPage County Sheriff James Mendrick, Republican candidate for Illinois governor, speaks with reporters at the Illinois State Fair in Springfield on Aug. 14, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;James Mendrick, DuPage County’s top cop&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendrick, in his second term as sheriff of Illinois’ second largest county, says he’s “not just a police chief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I run a $70 million operation.

He then went from being a Friar to a buyer, spending almost five months as a stockbroker on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two different worlds and hard lessons taught in both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while he admittedly never had the talent of a Rob Dillingham, he knows a little bit about when a point guard should be a buyer and when he should be a seller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why there have already been a handful of tough love moments since Dillingham has joined the Bulls in a trade deadline deal with Minnesota. The ultra quick guard has shown an ability to use his slick ball handling and wiggle to get into the teeth of the opposing defense, but has also put bad habits on display, trying to score from impossible angles once he does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad habits that can be broken? That’s the hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He is going to have to learn what gets you here doesn’t keep you here and what gets you here doesn’t necessarily take you to a next step,” Donovan said after the loss to the Knicks on Sunday. “As the talent gap shrinks, you have to make adjustments and changes. He’s so explosive and so fast with the ball, probably for most of his career no one could keep him in front. He probably got to the rim whenever he wanted to, and he could use his athleticism to go finish. Now all of a sudden he can’t do that all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that Dillingham didn’t have a few wow moments in his 24 minutes of work, scoring eight points, grabbing four rebounds and finishing a plus-9 in plus/minus when he was out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, the missed breakaway dunk wasn’t a shining moment, and he did force a few shots in the paint, but he also rallied a few minutes after that botched slam, drove the paint and sprayed it out to Patrick Williams for the three-pointer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Textbook point guard play in Donovan’s offense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s the one issue the coach is having with Dillingham right now – decision making. Just because he could dominate the opposition in high school and college with blow-bys doesn’t mean he’ll get away with it in the Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s why Minnesota gave up on the No. 8 overall pick after just 84 regular-season games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What he can do at an elite level is get into the lane,” Donovan continued. “He’s got to make (better) decisions when he gets there. There’s balance where you don’t want to take away a guy’s aggressiveness by yanking him. He’s really gifted and talented and has great speed. This is going to be the evolution for him as a player, because with his size (he’s listed at 6-foot-2) there are certain things he can’t do at the basket. What he can do is make everyone else around him better, and that’s what we have to work with him on without taking away the aggressiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good thing for Dillingham is more playing time might continue coming his way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anfernee Simons is sidelined with an injured wrist, Jaden Ivey might miss the remainder of the season as his knee is an issue, and Josh Giddey and Tre Jones remain on strict minutes restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A suddenly crowded guard room is down to Giddey, Jones, Collin Sexton and Dillingham, and in the Knicks game Dillingham played more than all three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he wants to continue that trend, he needs to understand one basic lesson from his coach: “Greed is good,” but only on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;",

Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago leaders, including Mayor Brandon Johnson and Gov.

After completing his physical, Conforto is expected to officially join team workouts on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this point, we're looking to bring in candidates to just strengthen the roster,” Cubs manager Craig Counsell said. “And it’s a sign of just continuing to do that. Michael had a down year last year, but has been a good player in this league for quite a while.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conforto, 32, hit just .199 with the Dodgers last season. But his decade-long career includes an All-Star nod in 2017, a 33-home run season in 2019, and .322 batting average and .927 OPS during the shortened 2020 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He's a player that's had a lot of success in this league,” Counsell said. “And if he can recapture some of that, you’re going to have a useful player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conforto joins fellow non-roster invitee outfielders Dylan Carlson and Chas McCormick, all with proven major-league track records. The spring battle for the fourth outfield spot also includes Kevin Alcántara and Justin Dean, who are on the 40-man roster and have minor-league option years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be plenty of available playing time for the group in the coming weeks, thanks to the World Baseball Classic. Right fielder Seiya Suzuki left Monday to join Team Japan in Tokyo. Center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong is set to depart later this week to join Team USA. Both are expected to have deep runs in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes when you sign guys, it's like, where's the opportunity here?” Counsell said. “And then we show up in five days, and there's a big opportunity, right? So that's how you look at this.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

But U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity continues. While it has remained at pre-Blitz levels, communities that the feds swarmed are changed.&amp;nbsp;Here’s how things are different, according to people who live there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alejandra, a parent&lt;/b&gt;: An immigrant from Mexico and a mother of three, Alejandra is worried for her children, one in high and two in elementary school in Pilsen. She says after the blitz, she's rethinking her children's involvement in extracurricular activities — and her own involvement in the community, with her sense of safety gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cecy’s Molino de Masa&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Since 1986, Cecilia \"Cecy\" Villarruel has been producing masa in South Chicago. Since the blitz, Villarruel says there's been a decrease in sales, as people are afraid to wait in line — they'll send their grandchildren, or the business will make home deliveries. \"People are terrorized to go out,\" Villarruel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Viento, the running club&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Before Operation Midway Blitz, the captains and runners of Viento, the Little Village run club, would only message each other to cancel a run. Now they message to check if there have been sightings of federal agents, then decide when they’ll run and their route.&amp;nbsp;The club has a new rule: No one can run by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjjjrc-l-k/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ

The South Side Democratic state senator, an officeholder since 2008, was on trial for federal charges of taking bribes and lying to federal authorities.&amp;nbsp;Gov.

But after a mistrial, Jones in December announced an agreement with federal prosecutors that will keep him out of jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The challengers&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Newcomer Ahmed Karrar jumped into the race in January.

Then they will be 'so focused' on staying in Illinois until Indiana proposes [another deal].\" — &lt;i&gt;Kevin Beese&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The Bears will follow the money and go to Indiana if the Hoosiers are the high bidder ... I will not go to the new stadium because I do not give my money to blackmailers.\" — &lt;i&gt;Doug Berman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"About 25% serious. They'd be getting an amazing deal, but even a franchise this historically poorly run is probably concerned about the optics of leaving the state of Illinois. They're using it as leverage, looking to squeeze out every last bit of tax breaks they can in Illinois.\" — &lt;i&gt;Jordan Mainzer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I don't think it matters if the Bears are serious about this move or that. What matters is whether or not the owners are willing to invest in a team that has made them billionaires, and it is clear they are not. Instead, they want the public to pay for it&amp;nbsp;.\" — &lt;i&gt;Bill McCormick&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading the Sun-Times&amp;nbsp;Morning Edition!&lt;br&gt;Got a story you think we missed?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:newsletters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Email us here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written and curated by&lt;/b&gt;: Matt Moore&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor&lt;/b&gt;: Eydie Cubarrubia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Chicago Sun-Times is a nonprofit supported by&amp;nbsp;readers like you.

Here are the most dangerous teams seeded outside the top five in this week’s regional play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No. 6 Oswego (22-9)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be wary:&lt;/b&gt; No. 3 Bolingbrook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Panthers not only finished strong and have a bonafide go-to player in sophomore Ethan Vahl (21.3 ppg, 7.8 rpg 3.2 apg), but they’ll be playing the regional on their home floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up is Plainfield East. Then it’s a tall task: Bolingbrook, which beat the Panthers handily in January, 83-60. But that’s one of just two losses a much-improved Oswego suffered in the final 16 games of the regular season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No. 6 Riverside-Brookfield (23-7)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be wary:&lt;/b&gt; No. 3 Young&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;R-B must first take care of a tough No. 11 seed, Simeon, in the regional semis before getting a shot at Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulldogs have played well in the second half of the season with the wins piling up while grabbing a share of the Upstate Eight East. They are an impressive 15-2 since late December, including wins over Lyons and Glenbard East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior guard Cameron Mercer (21 ppg) is a seasoned threat at both ends of the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No. 7 St. Francis (13-14)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be wary:&lt;/b&gt; No. 1 Joliet Catholic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After playing a rugged Catholic League schedule, this is an extremely menacing low-seeded team in Class 3A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spartans are laying in the weeds with their 13-14 record. But Tanner Hozian (10 ppg) and Carter Clark (8 ppg) have provided a steady senior hand, and 6-7 junior Ben Whorlow (12 ppg, 8 rpg) has emerged in recent weeks, averaging 16 points in the last 10 games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2026/02/23/ihsa-basketball-state-tournament-preview-class4a\"   &gt;Previewing and predicting the IHSA Class 4A boys basketball state tournament&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2026/02/23/ihsa-basketball-class-3a-preview\"   &gt;Previewing and predicting the IHSA Class 3A boys basketball state tournament&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No. 9 Lyons (22-6)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be wary:&lt;/b&gt; No. 8 Oak Lawn and No. 1 Curie&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be the most dangerous low-seed in regional play. Lyons just popped into the Super 25 rankings for the first time this week at No. 21 after winning its 11th straight game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Grant Smith (17 ppg), Nate Woods (12 ppg), Owen Carroll and Timmy Sloan, they have enough size, shooting and talent to put a scare into anyone. That includes top-seeded Curie in a potential regional final Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No. 9 Rich (17-12)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be wary:&lt;/b&gt; No. 7 Thornwood and No. 2 Marist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The record is deceiving. And it’s a much scarier team than even a few weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Raptors finished the regular season strong, winning six of their last seven, after playing a grueling schedule that included current ranked teams Benet, H-F, Kenwood, Glenbard East, Lyons and Kankakee twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich is playing on its home floor, have already beaten regional semifinal foe Thornwood twice and just recently welcomed back senior star guard Jameson Coulter for the first time all season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coulter, who has averaged 17 points a game in five games, has provided a boost to a team that’s relied on extreme balance and depth with a host of contributors, led by senior Kavon Ammons (16 ppg), Jahmir Brown (8 ppg), TJ Eaton (8 ppg), Amari Winters, Jonathan Booker and Jeremiah Weatherford.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Here are the picks for every sectional in the state, along with who will be playing in Champaign on the final weekend of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bartlett Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; Batavia over Glenbard East; Glenbard North over York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional pick:&lt;/b&gt; Batavia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There might not be another sectional with more legitimate balance among the top four seeds than in this Bartlett Sectional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leads to the belief this sectional could go any way possible among those four seeds. And don’t be surprised if one of the Wheatons throws a wrench into things in regional play as the No. 5 and No. 6 seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wheaton-Warrenville South, a team no one really ever enjoys playing, just knocked off red-hot Batavia in the final week of the season and is playing its best basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if it can get by Wheaton-Warrenville South South in the regional rematch, we’ll ride the hot hand of Batavia. This is a No. 4 seed that has ramped up its defense, has solid guard play with point guard Xavier Justice and has enough offensive firepower in Joe Reid and Evan Blankenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mount Carmel Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; Curie over St. Laurence; St. Ignatius over Young&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional Pick:&lt;/b&gt; St. Ignatius&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sectional is going to be a doozy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surviving the regional play in this sectional won’t be easy at all. There are quality lower-seeded teams lurking everywhere. The cast of characters ready to pounce are Kenwood, Lyons, Riverside-Brookfield, Oak Lawn and Perspectives-Leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyons is talented with size, length and shooting. The Lions have also ripped off 11 straight wins to close out the season. There wouldn’t be a tougher test for a No. 1 seed in any regional than what Curie would get with Lyons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riverside-Brookfield is another team playing well at the right time, going 15-2 in the second half of the season behind two-way threat Cam Mercer. The senior guard is a staunch defender to throw at Young’s Marquis Clark in the regional final and who averages 21 points a game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve got three of the top four seeds advancing with one slight upset: No. 5 St. Laurence over No. 4 Mount Carmel. The two went to overtime in the regular season but the young Caravan have not been trending the right way down the stretch, going just 2-6 in their last eight games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can St. Ignatius tame Marquis Clark of Young in a semifinal matchup? It was a tight one in the regular season with St. Ignatius winning 61-60 nearly three months ago. We’ll take the balance of the Wolfpack over the starpower Clark provides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then cue up a dandy of a sectional final with St. Ignatius and Curie and their go-to seniors: Curie’s Justin Oliver and St. Ignatius’ Chris Bolte. The projection here is the winner of this one — Curie beat St. Ignatius 42-40 two months ago — will be playing on the final night of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joliet West Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; Homewood-Flossmoor over Brother Rice; Marist over Lockport&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional Pick:&lt;/b&gt; Marist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regionals here produce the top four seeds — barely. Lockport will be thankful and fortunate the regional is on its home floor with surging Joliet West and dangerous Bloom in the regional with them. The Porters, led by Nedas Venckus (20 ppg) and Nojus Venckus (16 ppg), are 15-1 since the holidays and that includes a win over Homewood-Flossmoor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The forecast is for the top two seeds, H-F and Marist, to advance to a sectional final. They’ve clearly been the top two seeds in this sectional over the course of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H-F’s Darrius Hawkins Jr. has truly been brilliant, while the addition of Charles Barnes at Marist has been a game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marist’s opportunity to rectify the stinging 86-85 sectional loss to Rich last year is finally here for the RedHawks. They find a way to win their first sectional title in 45 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2026/02/23/ihsa-basketball-class-3a-preview\"   &gt;Previewing and predicting the IHSA Class 3A boys basketball state tournament&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/super-25-basketball-rankings/2026/02/22/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;Michael O’Brien’s Super 25 high school basketball rankings for Feb. 22, 2026&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rock Island Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; Alton over Edwardsville; Rock Island over Normal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional Pick:&lt;/b&gt; Rock Island&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many different odd regional matchups and travel due to the geographical footprint of this sectional, forecasting the results here is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also some real star power in this sectional, starting with Normal’s 1-2 punch of 6-7 junior Jarrel Brown and 6-6 sophomore Chase Kasten (18 ppg). The Ironmen are the No. 1 seed in their subsectional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a top 10 junior in the state, Belleville West’s J’Dyn Lloyd (19.2 ppg), along with 6-7 senior Ben Akoro (16.2 ppg), a Division I talent from O’Fallon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alton boasts a lethal combo of Semaj Stampley (13.5 ppg), a high-scoring senior guard headed to South Dakota State, and fast-rising junior Ryan Howard (17.9 ppg), while Edwardsville has a real sleeper talent in Micah Butler (15 ppg).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one heck of a regional title matchup could showcase super sophomore Amarion Smith-Holley of Peoria Richwoods and Rock Island junior guard Deven Marshall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if Rock Island, led by Marshall (20.5 ppg), can get back to playing the sectional on its home floor — the Rocks must first beat Peoria Richwoods in that Minooka Regional — I like its chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fremd Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; Fremd over Stevenson; Palatine over Hersey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional Pick:&lt;/b&gt; Palatine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What more could you ask for if you’re a high school basketball fan in the Mid-Suburban League and, specifically, in Palatine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MSL has provided fireworks and a wild three months. It shouldn’t let up in the postseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regular-season results start with Rolling Meadows, the No. 6 seed. The Mustangs played the top three seeds in three one-possession games, beating Hersey 42-40 while losing to Fremd 41-38 and to Palatine 42-40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palatine beat Barrington 52-51. Those two are set to meet in a regional championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it gets even better with those top three seeds: Hersey beat Palatine in three overtimes; Fremd knocked off Palatine in overtime; and Fremd edged Hersey in overtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two best MSL teams all season, Fremd and Palatine — and who split the two regular-season matchups — meet up one more time in Palatine. This one with a whole lot on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Loyola Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; DePaul Prep over New Trier; Evanston over Loyola&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional pick:&lt;/b&gt; DePaul Prep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePaul Prep will have its hands full in a 4A sectional with multiple ranked teams standing in its way of a fourth straight sectional championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a healthy Christopher Kirkpatrick, there is a real temptation here to pick New Trier. The Trevians have developed so much balance and possess that size and length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about an Evanston-Loyola rematch? It was Evanston over Loyola in a dramatic January win, thanks to a Ben Ojala buzzer-beating three-pointer. Evanston was without CSL South Player of the Year Vito Rocca. But this time the game will be at Loyola. Expect another toss-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of these sectional semifinals will be dogfights. If these two games aren’t tight, down-to-the-wire finishes, it will be a surprise. But the two teams that haven’t faced one another this season, DePaul and Evanston, finally meet in the sectional final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s just so hard to go against a DePaul team with senior anchors like Rashaun Porter and Rykan Woo. The winning pedigree is real and the schedule that has prepared the Rams is second to none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePaul has beaten Hyde Park, Loyola, Kankakee, St Ignatius, New Trier, Mount Carmel, Marist, St. Laurence and Warren. That list includes six teams currently ranked in the top 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bolingbrook Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; Benet over Naperville North; Neuqua Valley over Bolingbrook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional pick:&lt;/b&gt; Benet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there a team that can put a scare into the top three seeds that are all ranked among the top 10 in the Super 25? Realistically? Probably not, though Oswego is playing well and will get one more shot at Bolingbrook on its home floor in the regional final. But Bolingbrook has beaten the Panthers twice, including a 83-60 win in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves the Naperville North-Downers Grove South matchup as the lone regional title game that will be up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuqua Valley has the type of shooting and scoring in stars Cole Kelly and Mason Martin to put a scare into Benet. All they do together is put up 40-plus points a game and force you to game plan for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it first must get by a very talented Bolingbrook team, led by sophomore Brady Pettigrew, on the Raiders’ home floor. Neuqua did knock off Bolingbrook in a regular season January tussle. This would shape up as arguably the best sectional semifinal game in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in a strong, top-heavy sectional, it’s very difficult to pick against Benet here with all it as shown over the first three months of the season. This isn’t just the best team in the state, it’s the most complete team. The Redwings boast size, difference-making interior defense, rebounding and can knock down shots from the three-point line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rockton-Hononegah Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; Warren over Rockford Auburn; Waukegan over Rockford Guilford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional pick:&lt;/b&gt; Warren&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Warren already having beaten Rockford Auburn this season and taking down Waukegan twice, there isn’t a more prohibitive favorite in any 4A sectional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Auburn is scary with high-scoring guard Amir Danforth. This is a decorated player in the Rockford area who is wrapping up a monster career. In addition to averaging 19.8 points a game this season, Danforth has popped off for games of 44 and 42 in his career. He has scored 2,187 points — the second most in the history of the NIC-10 — and made a whopping 352 three-pointers in his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throw in the fact the Knights have won 10 of its last 11 games with the only loss at the hands of a very good Rock Island team, it’s a team that should at the very least grab Warren’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s never easy to beat a team three times in a season, especially one with the talent and experience Waukegan possesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jaxson Davis and Company are at another level. The Blue Devils are in position to win their third straight sectional championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Class 4A Supersectional Picks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UIC:&lt;/b&gt; St. Ignatius over Batavia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Batavia last made it to state 35 years ago. The impressive turnaround this season, and a long tournament run as a No. 4 sectional seed, comes to an end. St. Ignatius has made two trips to state in Class 3A. Now it advances to a Class 4A State Finals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ISU:&lt;/b&gt; Marist over Rock Island&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marist makes the most of its first supersectional game in 45 years, reaching state for the first time ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOW Arena:&lt;/b&gt; DePaul Prep over Palatine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coach Eric Millstone’s Palatine program has put together a heck of a four-year run but this is too tall of a task for the Pirates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This won’t be like DePaul’s previous supersectional games — the Rams beat Kaneland and Crystal Lake South by a combined 60 points in the last two 3A supers — but it’s a tough matchup for the Pirates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NIU:&lt;/b&gt; Benet over Warren&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this one materializes, it’s a rematch of a January showdown where Benet prevailed 67-60. Trying to take down Warren superstar Jaxson Davis twice in one season is no small feat. But Benet marches on in its quest to repeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Class 4A State Semifinal Picks:&lt;/b&gt; St. Ignatius over Marist; Benet over DePaul Prep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This IHSA Final Four would make history — and likely cause a bit of a stir — with four private schools squaring off in the state’s largest class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Class 4A State Championship:&lt;/b&gt; Benet over St. Ignatius&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve come full circle. Benet takes care of the one team it lost to this season — a 69-65 defeat on the last Sunday of November.&lt;/p&gt;",

That includes the two-time defending 3A champs, DePaul Prep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three of the four semifinalists from last year, DePaul Prep, Brother Rice and St. Patrick, are all in Class 4A this year. Both teams from the 2024 3A state title game, DePaul and Mount Carmel, are competing up a class in 4A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simeon and St. Ignatius, a pair of 3A semifinalists in 2022 and 2023, are also now Class 4A schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Class 3A has certainly been watered down a bit when it comes to the number of high-level contenders, it’s also creating a door that is wide open for new contenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the picks for every sectional in the state, along with who will be playing in Champaign on the final weekend of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Class 3A Previews and Picks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hinsdale South Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; St. Francis over Lemont; Oak Forest over Wheaton Academy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional pick:&lt;/b&gt; St. Francis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top-seed, Joliet Catholic, has enjoyed a stellar regular season for themselves behind Jayden Armstrong (18 ppg) and Donavyn Simmons (15 ppg). At 19-11 the Hilltoppers are on the cusp of just their second 20-win season in 45 seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with the regional on its home floor, Joliet Catholic will face the best low-seeded team in 3A in the title game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lowest seed to advance to a 3A sectional final in the past five years is Lemont, a No. 4 seed in 2022. With just a 13-14 record heading into the postseason, look for St. Francis to earn that moniker of “Cinderella” as a No. 7 seed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ve taken their lumps in the rugged Catholic League, but the Spartans are ready to surprise. That would start with an upset win on the road at Joliet Catholic, the No. 1 seed, in the regional final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wheaton Academy has ultra-productive Hayden Schroeder to lean on, but Oak Forest has been playing well. The Bengals are 9-3 down the stretch and closed out the season with a win over Hillcrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deerfield Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks&lt;/b&gt;: St. Viator over Grayslake Central; Deerfield over Wauconda&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional pick&lt;/b&gt;: Deerfield&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one sets up to be a fun, competitive and up-for-grabs sectional with multiple contenders. It wouldn’t be a shock to see any of the top four seeds pull off a sectional win — or two — and advance to a supersectional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Viator, who played ranked East Suburban Catholic Conference teams Benet, St. Pat’s and Marist to prepare for this 3A moment, and the top two teams in the Northern Lake County Conference, Wauconda and Grayslake Central, are all bonafide threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Deerfield-Wauconda semifinal showdown will produce the sectional winner, will be favored in the super and be playing in Champaign on the final weekend of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Alex Ortega and a group of four double-figure scorers, Wauconda is fun, fast and can score. But with a tough schedule the Warriors have faced, the home floor and the sectional’s best player, 6-8 senior Jake Pollack, Deerfield gets the edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of the Central Suburban League South, Deerfield has played 10 ranked teams in the Super 25 this season. Pollack (20 ppg, 8 rpg) and stat-sheet-stuffing Evan Nagler (14 ppg, 6 rpg, 3 apg) are three-year starters who will lead the Warriors to the program’s first sectional since 1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ottawa Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; Morton, Ill. over LaSalle-Peru; Kankakee over East Peoria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional pick:&lt;/b&gt; Kankakee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kankakee and the star tandem of Lincoln Williams and EJ Hazelett are the clear favorites. These are two Division I prospects and have a solid supporting cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Kays will get a test in a semifinal matchup with East Peoria, a team with three — yes, three — 1,000-point scorers. They have their own talented duo of junior Quinton Kitt, who is committed to Illinois, and junior guard Cole DuBois, while Jackson Ahrens also surpassed 1,000 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morton is red-hot. This is a team riding a 19-game win streak with wins over Peoria Richwoods and double-digit victories over East Peoria and Metamora during that stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morton will give Kankakee everything it can handle. Alex McKie is one of the elite shooters in the state. McKie is part of a senior-dominated perimeter group that includes Collin Burns and Owen Adams. Plus, 6-7 junior Brendan Petty is a late-blooming prospect who is coming on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Woodstock North Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; Kaneland over Rockford East; Sycamore over Cary-Grove&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional pick:&lt;/b&gt; Kaneland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaneland, led by seasoned lead guard Marshawn Cocroft (20 ppg, 4 apg), will have a battle on its hands, starting with a regional championship game with Geneva or the host, Burlington Central. They would also have the never-easy task of beating a Sycamore team for the third time this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The better news for Kaneland? If they can win the sectional for the second straight season, DePaul Prep won’t be waiting for them in the super.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;De La Salle Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; Hyde Park over Little Village; De La Salle over King&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional pick:&lt;/b&gt; De La Salle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to forecast anything other than a Hyde Park-De La Salle sectional title game here. And it will be a South Side postseason battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hillcrest Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; Leo over Morgan Park; Hillcrest over Thornton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional pick:&lt;/b&gt; Hillcrest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leo, led by Brian Kizer (15 ppg), makes the jump to 3A after losing 43-42 in a Class 2A sectional final last year. The Lions get to the final again but fall short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the way Hillcrest has come on over the second half of the season, the Hawks become a much bigger favorite now than when the sectional assignments were released in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hillcrest is 12-3 in its last 15 games with the three losses by a combined eight points, including a pair of ranked teams (Curie and York). The Hawks knocked off Thornton 42-40 at Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In search of its 11th sectional championship in program history, Hillcreset wins it on its home floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mahomet-Seymour Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; Decatur MacArthur over Champaign Centennial; Normal U-High over Lincoln&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional pick:&lt;/b&gt; Decatur MacArthur&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacArthur is a big favorite. How big? MacArthur has pounded sectional foes with lopsided wins over Springfield Lanphier (75-50), U-High (62-32), Mahomet-Seymour (72-36), Lincoln (56-38) and Champaign Centennial (80-66).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacArthus has a potent backcourt, though talented 6-3 guard Sean Lee (9 ppg) has been limited due to an injury he’s been dealing with. But 5-9 guard Tishawn Clemmons (18.8 ppg, 4 apg) just recently broke the Decatur Public Schools scoring record, previously held by MacArthur coach Terise Bryson, while Kymir Carson averages 14.3 points and five assists a game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waterloo Sectional&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semifinal picks:&lt;/b&gt; Centralia over Troy Triad; East St. Louis over Jacksonville&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sectional pick:&lt;/b&gt; East St. Louis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top-ranked team in Class 3A should cruise to the sectional championship game, where it would likely meet a Centralia (29-1) team with a sparkling record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This East St. Louis team is quick, athletic, balanced and boast a star. Penn State recruit Jamison White, a 6-8 big man and the state’s top-ranked senior prospect, is putting up 21 points, 13.2 rebounds and three blocks a game. He even steps out and can shoot it with 20 three-pointers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Flyers are potent with 6-3 Alex Johnson (17 ppg) and juniors Phillip Jones (11.6 ppg) and Terryion Webster (9.6 ppg) all as capable scorers surrounding White.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Class 3A Supersectional Picks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOW Arena:&lt;/b&gt; Deerfield over St. Francis&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;NIU:&lt;/b&gt; Kankakee over Kaneland&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;UIC:&lt;/b&gt; Hillcrest over De La Salle&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bank of Springfield:&lt;/b&gt; East St. Louis over Decatur MacArthur&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;State Semifinal Picks:&lt;/b&gt; Kankakee over Deerfield; East St. Louis over Hillcrest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Class 3A State Championship:&lt;/b&gt; East St. Louis over Kankakee&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

They will create at least 300 full-time jobs, including roles for engineers, scientists, manufacturing operators and lab technicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Construction will start this spring, with the facilities opening in 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This milestone demonstrates further progress against AbbVie’s $100 billion commitment to U.S. research and development, and capital investments over the next decade,” AbbVie CEO Robert Michael said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news comes after AbbVie broke ground in September on another $195 million manufacturing facility in North Chicago, where it’s headquartered. It will create about 50 full-time jobs when it opens in 2027.

Although they were skeptical about him earlier this season, that's no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the felony charge is unlikely to affect his NHL draft stock now that it has been dropped. (He is still facing a misdemeanor charge, but his hearing has been delayed and Penn State has not issued any internal discipline.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has never been any doubt about McKenna's giftedness offensively, which explains why he entered the season as the projected No. 1 overall pick and why his highlight reels tend to woo online fans quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His best attributes are his fantastic hands. He can mold the puck with his stick like a bowl on a potter's wheel. He controls it effortlessly, making slight movements to keep it away from opponents before getting it to the perfect angle for the next motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He combines that with excellent vision, play-reading, elusiveness and creativity. He's primarily a pass-first guy. Thirty of his 43 points this season are assists, as were 88 of his ridiculous 129 points (in 56 games) in the WHL last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;See all 7️⃣ of Gavin McKenna&amp;#39;s assists from &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/PennStateMHKY?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;@PennStateMHKY&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s win over Ohio State 👇 &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/bYIiPl3Qin\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bYIiPl3Qin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Big Ten Network (@BigTenNetwork) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BigTenNetwork/status/2025061440344699187?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 21, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, McKenna &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2025/11/18/blackhawks-2026-nhl-draft-prospects-gavin-mckenna-keaton-verhoeff-tynan-lawrence\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;disappointed&lt;/a&gt; many scouts and lost his status as the projected No. 1 pick this fall due to inconsistent work ethic and effort levels, particularly defensively and on the backcheck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many teenage prospects, he needs to gain weight and strength —&amp;nbsp;he's listed at 6-0 and 170 pounds — but he was also allowing himself to get pushed around and forced to the perimeter more easily than he should've been. The adjustment from junior to college hockey proved more difficult for him than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time has gone on, he has grown considerably, showcasing a more mature defensive game and learning how to physically match up against older, bigger opponents.  It doesn't hurt that he's outscoring his weaknesses to an even greater degree now, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks have heavily valued work ethic in draft decisions throughout general manager Kyle Davidson's tenure, so McKenna's growth in that regard suddenly makes him a viable fit for him again. And the biggest missing piece from the Hawks' future core is one more dynamic offensive winger, and he would certainly check that box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's still much left to be determined before the 2026 draft takes place in late June, though, both in terms of McKenna's progression and the Hawks' draft pick. If the season ended today, they would have only a 15.2% chance of winning the lottery for a top-two pick and much higher odds of picking sixth or seventh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swedish forward Ivar Stenberg, another frontrunner to be the No. 1 pick, continues to play extremely well against pros overseas. He has avoided controversies and has been more well-rounded than McKenna from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Latvian defenseman Alberts Smits was sublime as a teenager in the Olympics, pushing himself into conversation for top defenseman in the class alongside Keaton Verhoeff and Chase Reid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks have also long been interested in Canadian center Tynan Lawrence, and his lack of production since a midseason move to Boston University should be taken with a grain of salt considering BU's bizarre team-wide struggles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-890005\" name=\"list-890005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, anchorId=list-890005, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, _styledTemplate=/page/list/PageListH.hbs, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, pagination=[{body=[Next Page], href=?p=2, _template=/link/Link.hbs, contentId=null, pianoSectionSlug=null, target=null}], carouselSpeed=null, pullQuoteIcon=[{image=null, narrowImage=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=null}], buttonHoverBgColor=#a91d23, rteHeadingFont=font-1, secondaryColor=#656565, hideCategories=true, _template=/page/list/includes/PageList-header.hbs, font3=Arial, font4=Source-serif-4, ctaUrl=null, hideImage=false, suppressPagination=true, footerLinkHoverColor=#d3242c, hideAudioPlayback=false, description=[], showSecondItemMedia=false, listColumns234=null, footerTextColor=#ffffff, headerSecondaryBgColor=#000000, primaryTextColorInverse=#ffffff, titleColor=null, title=Latest on the Blackhawks, ampLink=null, listHeaderPosition=null, hideDescriptions=false, showActionBar=true, linkHoverColor=#d3242c, buttonBgColor=#d3242c, ctaTarget=null, promoButtonText=null, items=[{publishDate=February 22, 2026 12:55 PM, type=Image, description=[{items=[Coach Jeff Blashill has talked to Dach about moving his feet more and achieving more consistency with things other than physicality.]}], categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks, _styledTemplate=null, timestamp=1771786530000, imageAlignment=null, isFeatured=false, media=[{alt=Colton Dach, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/ce/97/c747b28940d796161a40d29b9d9a/dach.jpg, width=8640, height=5760}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/ce/97/c747b28940d796161a40d29b9d9a/dach.jpg, width=8640, height=5760}}], target=null, primaryMediaType=null, wordCount=631, ampLink=null, category=[{items=[Blackhawks]}], title=Blackhawks&amp;#x27;

And it gave Maton a promise of a kind of stability that he hadn’t had in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maton has pitched for five different organizations in the last three years, traded midseason in each of the past two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm not really new to new faces and new organizations,” he said. “But from as much as I've gathered in these three weeks [in Cubs camp], I feel like we have a good group of guys, guys that get it, guys put in the work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming off a promising year in which he dramatically improved his strikeout rate, Maton is also in that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He spins the ball really well, and that's his foundation.” Counsell said. “But he's always searching for, is there something else I can add, or is there something else I can get better at? That's never going to stop for him. You can tell by the way his mind works.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maton's latest project is adding a changeup to his spin-doctor repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn’t guaranteed to be successful. Maton knows that. Plenty of pitchers enter spring training every year thinking that they’ve unlocked a new offspeed pitch, only to realize that it doesn't work nearly as well when they’re built up to full velocity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Maton can get comfortable enough with his changeup to bring it into the regular season, however, it will enhance an arsenal that already includes a curveball, cutter, sweeper and sinker — in order of usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maton describes the new pitch as a modified kick-change. That version of a changeup, which uses seam properties to give it its shape, became the new “it” pitch last year. For several pitchers, including the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/06/12/cubs-jameson-taillon-and-ben-brown-adopted-the-same-type-of-changeup-this-season-with-promising-results\"   &gt;Cubs’ Jameson Taillon&lt;/a&gt;, it was a welcome answer after experimentation with other grips had failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Maton, it’s still a work in progress. When he gets the seam orientation right, it comes out of his unique release point looking like “the sickest pitch in baseball.” But when he doesn’t, it spins out like a hanging slider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't really want to go in a game in a big situation, throw that pitch, hope it's the strikeout one, and throw the bad one,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether the new pitch sticks — Maton's found plenty of success without it — the effort reflects his commitment to continuing to evolve. He's entering his 10th major-league season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He takes in information very well, and I think he also can apply that information very well,” Counsell said. “Phil's got a really good pitching mind — &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; good pitching mind. And that's fun to work with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs’ Opening Day bullpen appears to be almost entirely set, with the last spot still in question. Of course, health and performance could change the outlook as spring training progresses. And roles still have to be ironed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maton’s experience puts him in position to make an impact in high leverage. And though the Cubs do have several young homegrown arms in the bullpen, including reigning closer Daniel Palencia, it is a largely veteran reliever group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a lot of guys with unique shapes, unique looks,” Maton said. “But it's just guys have done before. They've had their periods where they're throwing great, they’ve had other periods where they’re throwing bad. And just having those older guys creates a little bit more stability throughout the year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\"

Dick Durbin will bring the Chicago woman who inspired him to introduce the Dream Act 25 years ago to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday, as several Illinois Democrats plan to instead skip it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are joining dozens of other Democrats who say they won't listen to the president offer his account of the state of the nation after a year of forceful deportation campaigns and health care cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Tammy Duckworth, along with U.S. Reps. Mike Quigley, Sean Casten, Delia Ramirez, Jan Schakowsky and Eric Sorensen, say they won't attend the annual address, with Duckworth calling it \"another campaign rally full of lies.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Nearly every day, this President and his Administration tells Americans to believe one thing as we see something else with our own eyes,\" Duckworth said in a statement. \"We'd all be better off if we listened to the facts — which are exactly the opposite of what comes out of his mouth.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schakowsky said constituents have flooded her office with calls asking her to skip this speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I cannot, in good conscience, sit in that House chamber on Tuesday night and pretend everything is normal while families across my district are living in constant fear of this administration and fighting every day just to keep food on the table and a roof over their heads,\" Schakowsky said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez is joining at least 15 other Democrats attending a protest event at the National Mall called the \"People's State of the Union.\"  Quigley said he will be attending a virtual town hall hosted by Indivisible Barrington instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Durbin on Monday said his guest is Tereza Lee,  a concert pianist raised on the North Side by Korean immigrants, whose life story inspired Durbin to introduce legislation that would become known as the Dream Act. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act would allow noncitizens without legal status who were brought to the U.S as children — and meet certain education, military service or work requirements — to earn lawful permanent residence. But the measure remains stalled after being first introduced in 2001. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/11/16/23462526/sen-dick-durbin-time-running-out-for-senate-to-pass-dreamer-legislation\"   &gt;Durbin has introduced&lt;/a&gt; the legislation every Congress since, including the Dream Act of 2025 with U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee, born in Sao Paulo Brazil, came to the U.S. with her parents at age 2 legally on visitors' visas and grew up in Chicago. She was 12 when she learned of her immigration status  — and learned her father was afraid  to fill out any paperwork that would attract attention to her immigration status. A Lane Tech High School music teacher helped her get accepted into the Merit School of Music — and the school ultimately helped her get through college. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee went on to obtain a Doctorate from the Manhattan School of Music and has been a teacher there since 2011. She played her debut at Carnegie Hall in 2009 — and is now a U.S. citizen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi's guest is a 21-year-old University of Illinois at Chicago student whose father was held in Broadview during the peak of Operation Midway Blitz, and Rep. Robin Kelly will bring Chicago Urban League CEO Karen Freeman-Wilson. Rep. Bill Foster's guest is Suzanne Hoban, founder and executive director of the Family Health Partnership Clinic, which provides health care to uninsured adults in McHenry County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Nikki Budzinski is bringing Laura Petty, a constituent from downstate Alton,  whose family has been affected by rising health care costs, and Rep. Brad Schneider is bringing Learning Resources CEO &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/taxes/2025/11/05/supreme-court-tariffs-vernon-hills-toymaker-learning-resources\"   &gt;Rick Woldenberg, &lt;/a&gt;who sued the Trump administration over tariffs. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/economy/2026/02/20/supreme-court-trump-sweeping-tariffs-john-roberts-economic-agenda\"   &gt;struck down &lt;/a&gt;Trump's sweeping tariffs, and Woldenberg's company was one of the plaintiffs in that suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jonathan Jackson's guest is Pastor Sandy Gillespie, an advocate worried about hunger and SNAP benefits. Rep Lauren Underwood's guest will be Pastor Jennifer Amy-Dressler of Open Table United Church of Christ in Ottawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia last month announced &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/03/marimar-martinez-shot-border-patrol-chicago-speaks-out-after-good-pretti-deaths-i-am-their-voice\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Marimar Martinez&lt;/a&gt;, the Chicago woman who was shot five times by Border Patrol agents in Chicago last fall, would be his guest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Monday said he will bring a constituent, as well as members of Rev. Jesse Jackson's family as guests to the address. His office did not specify which family members would attend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffries said Jackson, who died Feb. 17 at the age of 84, \"was a transformative political figure and a trailblazer extraordinaire who fought to make America live up to its promise of a thriving multiracial democracy.” &lt;/p&gt;",
