Chaos ensued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giants second baseman &lt;b&gt;Luis Arraez&lt;/b&gt; barehanded the ball on the bounce and tossed it home, prompting Suzuki to race for second. Giants first baseman &lt;b&gt;Rafael Devers&lt;/b&gt; cut off the throw and fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw had stopped in his tracks around third, while Bregman kept his head down and ran. They ended up on the same base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I thought I got a good read off the bat,\" Bregman said, \"and then I should have ran a little bit more with my head up.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giants shortstop &lt;b&gt;Willy Adames&lt;/b&gt; ran over, tagged both runners, and handed the ball to third baseman &lt;b&gt;Matt Chapman&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew that, since I was the trail runner, I was out,” Bregman said. “But I’ve got to do a better job of just staying on the base, clarifying that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two outs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Bregman headed to the dugout, correct in his assessment of the play, Shaw had a brief conversation with third-base coach &lt;b&gt;Quintin Berry&lt;/b&gt;. Shaw stepped off the base, pulling off his sliding mitt and helmet as he talked. Chapman, still holding the ball, tagged him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three outs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what happened,” Adames told Giants reporters. “That’s the beauty of baseball, I guess. Every day, you see something new.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Bregman: “We'll learn from it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Long set to see doctor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs hope that&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/21/how-tokyo-series-prepared-cubs-matthew-boyd-for-wbc-ramp-up\"   &gt; first baseman &lt;b&gt;Jonathon Long&lt;/b&gt;’s left elbow sprain &lt;/a&gt;isn’t serious enough to force him to withdraw from the World Baseball Classic, manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell&lt;/b&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long, a non-roster invitee, sustained the sprain Saturday in a collision Saturday during the Cubs’ game against the Rangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs shut him down from baseball activities Sunday, and he’s set to see a doctor Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He's sore today, and there's some swelling there today,” Counsell said. “But if it's just that, then, we're probably at two, three days [off] here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long was scheduled to leave Cubs camp this week to join Team Chinese Taipei for the WBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gold for USA&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs were gathered in their clubhouse Sunday morning, with the TVs turned to the men’s hockey Olympic gold medal game between the United States and Canada, when Jack Hughes’ “golden goal” delivered the victory to the stars and stripes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were all fired up,” said Bregman, who will be representing the US in the WBC this year. “We were going crazy in the clubhouse when we scored.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can that be replicated in the upcoming baseball tournament?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let's do it, let's go win,” Bregman said. “USA, baby.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

They were joined by Gov. JB Pritzker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes after a year of attacks on federal workers' unions from the Trump administration, including the cancellation of several standing contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group is pushing for higher pay, a higher annual uniform allowance and safety measures for postal workers in the field in this new round of bargaining, which is expected to begin Wednesday, according to Elise Foster, president of NALC Branch 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foster, a 30-year letter carrier from Pilsen, said postal workers often have to save up for years to get adequate uniforms to work outdoors through the city’s seasons. She said many union members are also concerned about safety after mail carrier Octavia Redmond was &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2024/10/01/boy-15-charged-with-fatally-shooting-postal-worker-octavia-redmond-west-pullman\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;fatally shot two years ago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are some of the top key items even just to retain employees,” Foster said. “No one do what we do, the way we do it, that’s why first-class service deserves first-class pay. … We have to deliver ourselves back home to our families.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-ff0000\" name=\"image-ff0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8f6f124/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F2c%2Fe25794db40b1a18d19ecd18f2eb1%2Fnalcrally-260223-05.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18f24ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F2c%2Fe25794db40b1a18d19ecd18f2eb1%2Fnalcrally-260223-05.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8b90d1e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F2c%2Fe25794db40b1a18d19ecd18f2eb1%2Fnalcrally-260223-05.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Gov.

DeJoy agreed to cut 10,000 letter carriers from the 640,000-person force and billions of dollars from the USPS budget&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has also repeatedly called for the privatization of USPS.

Trump said the cancellations were allowed because the agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency, play a role in national security, a claim that labor groups are disputing in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump then canceled contracts for three agencies’ unions, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/environment/2025/08/12/president-donald-trump-union-contracts-chicago-us-environmental-protection-agency\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;stripping union protections&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from EPA workers in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a90001\" name=\"image-a90001\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/86ebdd6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5522x3099+0+347/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F69%2F36cbc83a44b08d2baf4e580e5f04%2Fnalcrally-260223-07.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8674589/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5522x3099+0+347/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F69%2F36cbc83a44b08d2baf4e580e5f04%2Fnalcrally-260223-07.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d5749cd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5522x3099+0+347/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F69%2F36cbc83a44b08d2baf4e580e5f04%2Fnalcrally-260223-07.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Workers with the National Association of Letter Carriers rally ahead of bargaining for their next contract Sunday, February 22, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d5749cd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5522x3099+0+347/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F69%2F36cbc83a44b08d2baf4e580e5f04%2Fnalcrally-260223-07.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c6ee9b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5522x3099+0+347/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F69%2F36cbc83a44b08d2baf4e580e5f04%2Fnalcrally-260223-07.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d5749cd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5522x3099+0+347/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F69%2F36cbc83a44b08d2baf4e580e5f04%2Fnalcrally-260223-07.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers with the National Association of Letter Carriers rally ahead of bargaining for their next contract Sunday.

He apologized. On Sunday, he explained why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I just told him, ‘I’m sorry, man,’ ’’ Collins told the media two days before his scheduled surgery Tuesday. ‘‘I thought I had a lot more to give him this year. Unfortunately, between the wrist and the toe, I just didn’t have a chance to show it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I thought I had a really good summer. I was really looking forward to helping the team. It’s been a frustrating year injury-wise as a whole for the team, but individually I knew I had more to give him and felt like the team would have been in a better spot had I not gone through all these injuries.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone, however, is a 6-10 big man who plays with the kind of physicality few on the Bulls do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why the injury to Collins was so detrimental to what Donovan wanted from the Bulls. All the talk last summer and into fall camp was about ramping up the physicality. Then Collins suffered a wrist injury, came back for 10 games to help the Bulls go 6-4, then suffered the toe injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls hoped it would be a small setback, but it never improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We tried to give it every chance we could to get it to heal, and there comes a certain point where you start messing with the outcome of the surgery if you wait too long,’’ Collins said. ‘‘We’re at that point right now. The toe just didn’t get to the point where we wanted it to. We’re at eight weeks now. We just had to kind of bite the bullet and make sure that [even if] we can’t get back this year, we can show everyone that the toe is fine and it’s not going to be a problem in the future.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is important for Collins to show, given that he will be an unrestricted free agent in July. Donovan said Saturday that Collins would be back if things were up to him, but that’s not his call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins, however, made it clear where he wants to play next season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I’d love to be back here,’’ Collins said. ‘‘I feel like I came here last year at a time where I was out of the lineup [with the Spurs], and once I got here I was able to play a lot, got a lot of confidence back, got a lot of rhythm. I think the style we play here is just conducive to the success for myself and that I fit in well. I would love to build on that.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Simons says&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guard &lt;b&gt;Anfernee Simons&lt;/b&gt; missed the Bulls’ game against the Knicks with an injury to his left wrist suffered Saturday against the Pistons. There is no definitive timetable for his return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simons is scheduled to see a hand specialist and to get imaging done Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘He’s pretty sore right now,’’ Donovan said. ‘‘They just want to find out what’s going on in the hand.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Minute men&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guards &lt;b&gt;Josh Giddey&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Tre Jones&lt;/b&gt; and forward &lt;b&gt;Jalen Smith&lt;/b&gt; will remain on minutes restrictions as they recover from lower-body injuries. Donovan said all three are supposed to play less than 24 minutes a game.&lt;/p&gt;",

But as the season has progressed, she's fielded calls from the league's coaches, players, and of course, her Rose BC teammates, who were champions in the league's inaugural season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They all wanted Reese back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"She's Rose basketball,\" teammate Kahleah Copper said of Reese. \"The culture we created was on her back.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reese eventually obliged. She signed a deal with Unrivaled to play the final three games of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rose BC is lucky she had the time. Reese has been everywhere this WNBA offseason, from modeling in the Victoria Secret fashion show to booking acting gigs on the popular Netflix series \"The Hunting Wives.\" Most recently she went on a promotional tour in Australia for her signature shoe, the AR1s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Literally I was in Australia and they were like 'You want to come back?'\" Reese said. \"I was like, 'alright.' Literally I was on the beach last week, and now I'm here.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reese said she hasn't played basketball in months. In her first two games back with Rose BC, it was like she never left. She's averaging her typical double-double, including a 15-rebound performance against the Laces. With that win, Rose BC clinched the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should Rose BC advance to the Semifinals, they'll play at Barclays Center on March 2 in a double-header.&lt;/p&gt;",

Even after the Bulls fell to the Knicks 105-99 for their ninth consecutive loss, their longest skid since January 2019, he wasn’t going to change his stance about competitiveness over development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘From a locker-room standpoint and going in there every single day as professionals that take their job seriously, to go in there and say, ‘Listen, guys, we’re not even trying,’ or, ‘Hey, we’re going to do this, this and this,’ I have not gotten that,’’ Donovan said. ‘‘So he’s not available to play [right now], but let’s see how Jaden [Ivey] can help the group. Or how Rob [Dillingham] can help the group. But our intention is to go out there and try and win every single night. It’s been a challenge from the standpoint of trying to get all these guys on the same page.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a method to Donovan’s madness, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it became obvious the Bulls didn’t have the horsepower to keep up with the Knicks, especially late, Donovan’s feeling is that force-feeding the idea of staying competitive — undermanned or not — is allowing development to happen. That specifically goes for forward Matas Buzelis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s been a lot harder on Matas, but I think in a good way,’’ Donovan said. ‘‘When Coby [White] was here and Ayo [Dosunmu] was here and ‘Vooch’ [Nikola Vucevic] was here, even though [Buzelis] got into the starting lineup, he’s now starting to see the best defenders in the league night in and night out. I think that’s a great opportunity for him to make a jump because he’s starting to learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘The consistency of being able to perform at a really high level against really good defenders and good players is something he’s kind of gotten thrust into, and I do think that because of his makeup and competitiveness, how much he leans into that, that could really help him.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it will someday soon, but it didn’t help late against the Knicks. While Buzelis finished with 15 points, he had two good looks on three-pointers with the game in reach and just more than two minutes left. He missed both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while this latest loss didn’t feature the kind of meltdown the Bulls endured in the third quarter 24 hours earlier against the Pistons, it was another reminder of why the Knicks are competing for a top-four playoff spot in the Eastern Conference and the Bulls (24-34) are doing what they can to improve their lottery odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The culprit was a familiar one. Turnovers gave the Knicks an opportunity to take control of the game in the third quarter, opening a 13-point lead. The Bulls turned the ball over seven times in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To their credit, however, the Bulls came back and made a game of it. But the result still wasn’t good enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We’ve got to find ways to be way more competitive,’’ said guard Josh Giddey, who shot 2-for-10 from the field and scored six points. ‘‘It starts with that first unit. We’ve got to set the tone. But we’ve got to find ways, one through 15, to get this thing on the right track.’’&lt;/p&gt;",

My doctor is recommending that anyone who visits the baby in the first three months be up to date on vaccines (Tdap, flu, COVID and RSV, if age 60-plus). We have decided to follow our doctor's recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of my family members are resistant to getting these vaccines and want us to consider other options, like testing and wearing a mask, which is not as safe. Also, it would be hard for younger kids to do — my niece is 3. Abby, we vaccinated our young children (3 and 5) at the time when our niece was born, as part of what my sister requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am already stressed about this situation and do not want to talk it to death with my family, and I have grown resentful because of it. In the past, I have set boundaries with my family, and most of them have not been understood or received well. Can you offer me some guidance? — &lt;i&gt;EXPECTING IN WASHINGTON&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR EXPECTING:&lt;/b&gt; I am happy to try. When your baby arrives, the responsibility for its welfare will rest mostly on you, the mother. Follow your doctor's medical advice to protect your child. If family members don't want to respect your wishes and do what they must to avoid endangering your baby (as you did for them), realize you can't change their minds, and keep your distance for the first three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; For nearly five years, my adult daughter was a domestic violence victim. My husband and I have done everything to support her freedom and new path. However, during her journey, she claimed that I had been abusive to her as a child. I do not recall any action I took that could be considered abusive, nor does my husband or her siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am finding it difficult to rationalize her recollection of events when she didn't recognize her recent relationship was abusive. Anyhow, I've recommended individual and group therapy. However, I have not admitted to any abuse because it didn't happen. We all feel she's projecting her anger and resentment from this recent relationship onto me because I was honest from the beginning that I saw red flags. We had candid conversations about the offender prior to the separation. But she keeps defending him and blaming me for having inflicted pain and suffering on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please tell me what you suggest I do to resolve this situation, as it is destroying our family. — &lt;i&gt;DUMBFOUNDED IN DELAWARE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR DUMBFOUNDED:&lt;/b&gt; Your daughter appears to be a troubled individual. I'm glad that you suggested therapy. The kind I would recommend would be family therapy, in which every member has a chance to air their \"truths.\" When someone in an abusive relationship attempts to deflect blame from their abuser onto someone else, they may be avoiding reality. A licensed psychotherapist could help put your daughter back on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video gambling is called the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://features.propublica.org/the-bad-bet/video-gambling-addiction-illinois/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“crack cocaine of gambling”&lt;/a&gt; for a reason: The machines are scientifically designed to be maximally addictive. They suck up a person's beer money, followed by their rent money, followed by their grocery money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, the city could get a cut of that, but the rest of it will be gone from the Illinois economy, and the city will be left dealing with the fallout: more people homeless, more children hungry, more theft, more bankruptcies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video gaming machines will make our city poorer. Let's keep them out of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tom McDougal, South Kenwood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Civil discourse&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witnessing relatively civil U.S. Senate candidates’ debates has been reassuring. \"Relatively\" is the key word, but despite a few well-practiced barbs, contentiousness has been muted. That’s good for Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/01/26/senate-debate-illinois-krishnamoorthi-stratton-kelly\"   &gt;three leading hopefuls &lt;/a&gt;want to curb U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.

You are all being incited into a civil war, yet none of it solves any of the real problems that we all face, and tragically people are dying.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political campaigns can turn normally decent people surly in no time. Primary debates bring out the worst in candidates from both parties. We saw this during the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/4/3/18368492/lori-lightfoot-wins-historic-mayoral-race-this-is-amazing\"   &gt;Toni Preckwinkle-Lori Lightfoot&lt;/a&gt; Chicago mayoral race in 2019. Both have been overall thoughtful public servants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats should be poised for success this November — assuming we still have free elections. Well-meaning Democrats have, however, been known to shoot themselves in the foot at the worst times. But if Democrats can buck that trend in Illinois this fall, maybe it’ll catch on in other states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jim Newton, Itasca&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trump’s cuts antithetical to American values&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump is executing an assault against areas averse to MAGA ideologies, including Illinois, by targeting their state’s funding and access to aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Gov. JB Pritzker and the city of Chicago over the last year, denied disaster aid to thousands of Chicago residents even though his own administration documented extraordinary damage from two major storms that hit the city last summer, according to records obtained by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/11/22/trump-refused-to-send-disaster-aid-to-chicago-despite-devastating-damage-00655716\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Politico’s E&amp;amp;E News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"These numbers indicate to me that Illinois and Pritzker are being penalized for standing up against the Trump administration,\" a former official with the Federal Emergency Management Agency told the news outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The October shutdown followed.

Earlier in the year, the Department of Government Efficiency &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/politics/2025/03/03/musks-doge-moves-to-cancel-leases-for-federal-offices-across-illinois\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;set a goal&lt;/a&gt; in Illinois \"to shut down half of the properties that the government owns and cancel half the leases with private property owners.\" This included the Metcalfe Federal Building, which holds the Environmental Protection Agency's Region 5 office and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal actions under the Trump administration have also led to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-appropriations.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/doe-project-terminations-oct-2025.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;cuts in science program&lt;/a&gt;s at colleges, cancellations of clean energy projects statewide and targeted terminations of Department of Energy programs affecting institutions like the University of Illinois and Northwestern University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional national reporting proves the canceled clean energy cuts that persist today, after the shutdown, are &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://vitalsigns.edf.org/8-billion-in-cuts\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;concentrated in states&lt;/a&gt; that did not vote for Trump during the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students in Illinois deserve a president who sees Chicago as an American city and Illinois as an American state. It shouldn’t matter whether you’re in a red or blue area; instead, aid should be based on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of your vote, because America is defined by its diversity, federal funding in case of emergency should be guaranteed. Simply put, the president shouldn’t be using his power to further political agendas. Such actions are antithetical to the true American democratic spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jayden Lawrence, junior, North Central College&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Milking nondairy options for children&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move to expand access to nondairy milk in &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp/wmfhka-implementation\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;school lunch programs&lt;/a&gt; is a long-overdue step toward healthier, more inclusive nutrition. Millions of students are lactose intolerant, allergic to dairy or come from families that avoid animal products for ethical or cultural reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering plant-based milk isn’t radical — it’s practical. These options provide essential nutrients without the saturated fat and cholesterol found in dairy, and they come with a much smaller environmental footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School meals shape lifelong habits. When we normalize plant-based choices early, we teach children that compassion, health and sustainability can coexist on the same tray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a time when childhood health concerns and climate anxiety are rising, modernizing school nutrition just makes sense. Giving students plant-based options empowers families, respects differences  and quietly models a kinder way forward one lunch at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Claude Prescott, West Town&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Warm thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The temperatures are rising, and the Cubs and Sox have started playing spring baseball, but it's hard to take any of this seriously when we couldn't even get above freezing recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides, didn't that shaggy varmint in Pennsylvania predict six more weeks of winter? But then optimism always reigns supreme this time of year, and more often than not, it's the only thing that keeps us going when venturing outside takes a true act of heroism. However, as sons and daughters of hearty pioneer stock, would we really prefer it any other way? Hey, don't answer that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bob Ory, Elgin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

She lived into her late 90s. She had an elementary school education, due to dropping out to help the family work in the fields. She lived half her life a stones-throw away from the plantation her elders had been enslaved on before moving with her daughter to the West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my most vivid memories of my great grandmother is her singing. When she was stressed, or taken by joy, or someone needed prayer, she sang. No words, just a familiar hum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Chicago premiere of “Black Cypress Bayou,” a play written by Kristen Adele Calhoun and staged at Definition Theatre in Hyde Park, the family drama centers a Black matriarch, Vernita Manifold, played excellently by RjW Mays. The Manifold family lives in east Texas on land that their family has inhabited since pre-emancipation. When the tensions get high — Vernita sings. Not always words. Sometimes just a gentle hum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part family drama and part murder mystery, Calhoun’s “Black Cypress Bayou” is packed with cultural richness, and trauma, but never feels too heavy. Instead, it feels &lt;i&gt;familiar&lt;/i&gt;. Calhoun is a Texas native herself, and I see in her script the delicate dance between religion and superstition that I saw in my own elders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RatingCard Enhancement\" data-module data-rating=\"3.5\"  data-align-center&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RatingCard-title\"&gt;\n        Black Cypress Bayou\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    &lt;div class=\"RatingCard-content\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-370000\" name=\"module-370000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.definitiontheatre.org/donate?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=10723383570&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAACRAu0B75zvJKwZJLcO29eLTf6BKi&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAqeDMBhDcARIsAJEbU9RKEkYTOpWR9Um2D7PRyZFapsqM1ht7yL0kmoIPkU6inOdVcpf-ztAaAuReEALw_wcB\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Definition Theatre,&lt;/a&gt; 1160 E. 55th St.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;When:&lt;/b&gt; Through March 15&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Info:&lt;/b&gt; Tickets from $25&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stage at Definition Theatre is intimate.

Each of the Manifold daughters, LadyBird and RaeMeeka, played by Michelle Renee Bester and Rita Wicks, have secrets of their own. Wicks is a force as the self-proclaimed “medicine woman” who has a side hustle selling weed. Her role is positioned as comic relief, but she also shines moments of seriousness, with a highlight being her recantation of a grisly disposal of a dead body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entire 90-minute production takes place deep in the Texas Bayou in a spot where the Manifold clan likes to fish. Designed by Alyssa Mohn, the sparse set included a lawn chair and a basket, but is dominated by a cypress tree. The tree, and its roots, have a contextual meaning in the plot, but the mostly bare stage allows the actors necessary room to occupy the small space without congestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The production moves fast but covers plenty of ground. After the richest white man in town is murdered, and Vernita appears to be framed as the culprit, the women in the Manifold family discover truths about each other, and their ancestors, while hunting for the actual killer. In the end, the audience is left with a message of forgiveness, for yourself as well as others, and the importance of letting go of trauma and moving on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the depth of the production, it’s almost hard to describe it as a comedy, but there are so many laugh-out-loud moments between the lessons that it feels like a fair assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Black folks like myself with roots in the South, especially Texas, Mays' performance represents so much of what our grandmothers were like. They were strong, protective (perhaps to a fault), proud women who carried secrets so deep that they feared sharing them would unleash a pain too great for the rest of us to bear. So they carried them alone. Underneath the big laughs and gun-toting Texans, the play reminds us to let go of those secrets so our souls can heal.&lt;/p&gt;",

JB Pritzker’s proposed budget, state funding for the arts would remain essentially flat into the next fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comes at a perilous time for arts across the country. Since beginning his second term just over a year ago, President Donald Trump has &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/arts-culture/2025/05/06/nea-grants-trump-chicago-cultural-events\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;clawed back grants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; given through the National Endowment for the Arts, announced he will &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"http://npr.org/2025/08/12/nx-s1-5500550/smithsonian-trump-review\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;close the Kennedy Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for two years of renovations after taking over control of the venue and called for &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"http://npr.org/2025/08/12/nx-s1-5500550/smithsonian-trump-review\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a sweeping review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Smithsonian exhibitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/03/31/nx-s1-5334415/doge-institute-of-museum-and-library-services\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;museums&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/arts-culture/2025/04/04/trump-humanities-grants-chicago-illinois-culture-national-endowmen\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;humanities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has also been slashed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the state budget released &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/springfield/2026/02/18/jb-pritzker-budget-proposal-state-of-state-social-media-tax\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;last week&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Pritzker proposed $25.9 million for the Illinois Arts Council, up just slightly from the $25.7 million allocated in fiscal year 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some arts advocates say the flat funding proposal is worrisome in a precarious moment for the sector overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arts Alliance Illinois, the statewide arts advocacy organization, is calling on the General Assembly to increase the arts budget by 20%, which it says would restore state funding levels to where they were 20 years ago. Since then, fiscal support for the arts has dipped on the state level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the state made a big increase in funding for the arts, growing the budget from $15.5 million to $25.5 million annually. Still, the Arts Alliance says the state has not supported the arts the way it did two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're grateful to not see any cuts in a tough budget year, but we’re not where we need to be in terms of per capita funding for arts and culture,” said Claire Rice, executive director of Arts Alliance Illinois. “We really want to see that number higher, particularly since arts funding is such a small fraction of the total budget. Even modest increases in the grand scheme of the budget means a lot to our creative community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Arts Council administers grants to organizations and artists statewide. It also sets public art policies and increases access to the arts in schools. Last year, the agency launched a schools-specific grant program, which provided supplies and materials to eligible schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The council said it saw a 120% increase in grant applications received in 2025. Joshua Davis-Ruperto, the executive director of the Illinois Arts Council, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/arts-culture/2025/01/13/chicago-arts-funding-trump-grants-dcase-individual-artists-program-iap\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;previously told WBEZ&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; direct funding for artists is a priority for his agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When talking to a lot of individual artists, one of the things that I found was that they were getting money for projects, but the problem was they weren’t able to pay their light bills,” Davis-Ruperto said in 2025. “And so, we started thinking about what would general operating support look like for these individuals? Looking at them as entrepreneurs and small businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to receiving dollars from the state’s general fund, the arts council receives federal dollars, which remain steady in the budget forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker has often expressed support for the arts and has said the sector helps drive economic growth in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Government support for the arts is vital to building a more cohesive society,” the governor said in a 2025 video posted online for the Arts Council’s 60th anniversary. “It creates increased opportunities for open expression in our communities, and it supports economic growth and jobs, and above all, we see the importance of embracing cultural diversity, something we pride ourselves on here in Illinois.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, will investment continue? The Arts Alliance says that falling behind in funding could lead to “losing talent and long-term economic growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alliance announced Friday that it will lead a landmark new study to examine “the economic power, infrastructure, and future potential of the Illinois creative economy,” which it plans to publish in June. It comes on the heels of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/music/2026/02/03/chicago-indie-venues-health-metro-ramova-salt-shed\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a report released this month&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the Chicago Independent Venue League that found that nearly three out of four independent live entertainment venues in the city are currently not profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The small businesses and the independent entrepreneurs that comprise our creative economy mean serious business for Illinois,” Rice said. “We need to continue to have the data that demonstrates our economic impact, that really shows our decision makers that these are economic engines in their communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is being supported by a public-private partnership, including funds from Chicago’s Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events, Illinois Arts Council and the Pritzker Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the city level, Chicago’s cultural affairs department &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/city-hall/2025/11/05/chicago-dcase-cultural-affairs-budget-clinee-hedspeth-kenya-merritt-grants-arts\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;saw a 15% funding cut&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during the latest budget cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bridge the gaps in government and philanthropic support, some nonprofit groups have increased arts grants, like Chicago’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/arts-culture/2025/10/09/3arts-grants-chicago-arts-funding-nea\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;3Arts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which awarded more than $1 million in artist grants last fall, marking a more than $400,000 increase from the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Courtney Kueppers is an arts and culture reporter at WBEZ.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The new fees also apply to license renewals. On Feb. 1, the annual license fee for a charter/sightseeing vehicle increased to $1,000 from $500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some advocates contend higher business license fees are yet another burden for &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2026/02/13/shop-local-campaign-brighton-park-immigration-raids-local-businesses\"   &gt;small businesses&lt;/a&gt; facing economic headwinds, including inflation, tariffs, and higher costs for health care and labor.

Its proposal was endorsed by more than 30 chambers of commerce and business advocacy groups and 15 members of the Chicago City Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Liesl Shurtliff, of Hyde Park, accompanied a friend to city hall to get a $250 regulated business license for a small cleaning business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had done everything right, and the business license was approved. Then they told us the fee was $1,000,” Shurtliff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were shocked, but Shurtliff paid the higher fee for her friend and then fundraised later to cover costs. Her friend is an immigrant who wants to remain anonymous because she fears retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shurtliff said the city’s website listed the license fee at $250, as of Jan.12, but the website was updated later that month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection said it has updated all license fees on its &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"http://chicago.gov/BusinessLicensing\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It also included the new fee information in its January/February newsletter, sent industry notices and informed partners that work with small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shurtliff and her friend had spent months last year preparing her business license application. She said they had no idea the fee was going up and would have applied before Jan. 1 if they had known about the price hike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes to business license fees were finalized late last year during city budget negotiations, Richardson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-3d0000\" name=\"image-3d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4ebbc92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2Fea%2F9a229bc94304961bd104b5c9ca9d%2Fsbac-bizlicensefees-260222-04.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/530b1fa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2Fea%2F9a229bc94304961bd104b5c9ca9d%2Fsbac-bizlicensefees-260222-04.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c591e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2Fea%2F9a229bc94304961bd104b5c9ca9d%2Fsbac-bizlicensefees-260222-04.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Small Business Advocacy Council president Elliot Richardson sits behind a desk\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c591e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2Fea%2F9a229bc94304961bd104b5c9ca9d%2Fsbac-bizlicensefees-260222-04.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/371f00c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2Fea%2F9a229bc94304961bd104b5c9ca9d%2Fsbac-bizlicensefees-260222-04.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c591e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2Fea%2F9a229bc94304961bd104b5c9ca9d%2Fsbac-bizlicensefees-260222-04.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small Business Advocacy Council president Elliot Richardson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there was stiff opposition to raising these fees, doing it during the budget process made it difficult for this issue to gain traction given the other budgetary battles being fought,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher fees took effect weeks after Mayor Brandon Johnson in December announced his &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2025/12/05/mayor-brandon-johnson-cut-red-tape-small-businesses-entrepreneurs\"   &gt;“Cut the Tape for Small Business” initiative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A steep “increase in fees seems like a lot more red tape to me,” Shurtliff said. “It's prohibitively expensive for small service-based businesses — cleaning, creatives, tutors, home-based businesses — many of whom operate on narrow margins. They are barely making ends meet and can’t absorb a sudden $1,000 upfront cost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shurtliff said helping her friend apply for a business license was complicated and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not easy to figure out how to do everything,” she said. “I can’t believe any small business is able to get off the ground without a ton of help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher license fees “incentivizes people to operate without a business license,” Shurtliff said. “Why are we giving so many tax breaks to big businesses and not giving breaks to small businesses?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fees for regulated and limited business licenses hadn’t been changed since 2012, according to a joint statement from the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection and the Chicago Office of Budget Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These adjustments help maintain essential city services while supporting long-term financial stability for the city of Chicago,” the departments said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city analyzed business license fees in other big U.S. cities and found those in Chicago were lower than its peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of our peer jurisdictions charge a much higher rate for the same service, better capturing the true cost to deliver that service to the public,” the departments said. “For example, a typical New York City regulated business license fee is $1,440, an example of the inconsistency between what the city of Chicago charges versus peer cities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richardson said, “We cannot turn back the clock on these fee increases and doubt Chicago politicians will take action to nullify them. They can, however, ensure the additional revenue raised through increased fees and fines are used to improve processes for small businesses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shurtliff said,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“It helps people make a living wage when they can own a business. We want people to be self-sufficient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Licensed businesses “are on the books. They pay taxes,” Shurtliff said. “It’s to all our benefit to make it as easy and cheap as possible to start one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new fees as of Jan. 1, according to the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection, include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-268b5480-0eb9-11f1-8347-4938c4da6a61\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limited business license: $500 for a two-year license, previously $250&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regulated business license: $1,000 for a two-year license, previously $250&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hotel license: $1,000 plus $2.20 per room for a two-year license, previously $250 plus $2.20 per room&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Commercial vessel license: $600 for any passenger occupancy limit, previously $350 annual license for commercial passenger vessel (tour boat or water taxi) with 20 or more occupancy and $75 annual license fee for under 20 occupancy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shared housing unit registration: $250 per year, previously $125&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shared housing unit operator license: $500 for a two-year license, previously $250&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Application for Commissioner’s adjustment for shared housing units: $360 per application, previously no fee&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Feb. 1, the new license fees include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-268b5481-0eb9-11f1-8347-4938c4da6a61\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Livery vehicle: $1,200 for a two-year license, previously $500 annual license fee&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charter/sightseeing vehicle: $1,000 annual fee, previously $500&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medical carrier vehicle: $600 annual fee, previously $500&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2026/01/15/volumes-bookcafe-wicker-park-close\"   &gt;Volumes Bookcafe in Wicker Park prepares to close&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Others are accusing Democrats of being beholden to interests that will benefit President Donald Trump’s administration — a clearly unpopular issue for Democrats in a primary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It seems like easy pickings for the types of giant corporate interest that wants to come in and spend,” said Reed Showalter, a candidate in the&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/what-to-know-about-illinois-7th-congressional-district-democratic-primary\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt; 7th Congressional District&lt;/a&gt;. “A few million dollars to buy a seat in Congress is a good deal. And for the rest of everybody who’s playing a grassroots game, that is a very damaging thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showalter is one of several candidates speaking out about the influence of super PACs in this primary cycle — in an unprecedented year with four open congressional seats and a Senate seat open in Illinois.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Israel Public Affairs Committee — the powerful pro-Israel organization — &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/19/rep-jan-schakowsky-withdrawal-donna-miller-endorsement-2nd-congressional-district-aipac-support\"   &gt;is playing a role&lt;/a&gt; in four congressional races in Illinois — helping to boost Cook County Commissioner Donna Miller in the 2nd; former U.S. Rep. Melissa Bean in the 8th; state Sen. Laura Fine in the 9th; and Chicago City Treasurer Melissa Conyears Ervin in the 7th. United Democracy Project, AIPAC’s affiliated super PAC, has spent more than $753,000 directly to support Conyears Ervin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/what-to-know-2nd-congressional-district-democratic-primary\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;The 2nd District&lt;/a&gt; is especially hit hard by super PAC influence, with Fairshake, a pro-crypto PAC funded primarily by Trump megadonors and business partners Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, targeting State Sen. Robert Peters. Fairshake is spending at least $1 million to run anti-Peters ads. And it’s the third Trump-affiliated super PAC to play a role in the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andreessen is the founder and general partner of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz — and a Trump adviser on tech and business policy — and he gave more than $4.7 million to advance the MAGA agenda in the 2023 and 2024 electoral cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affordable Chicago Now!, which is AIPAC-affiliated, is spending money in support of Miller, while the Leading the Future PAC, funded by OpenAI stakeholders, is backing former Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. in the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters’ campaign says Fairshake is targeting him because he voted for crypto state legislation that imposed new rules on digital asset firms. Peters co-sponsored the measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think any time big right wing billionaire donors come into a race, it’s like a jolt,” Peters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters said all three entities “are scared of having an effective progressive champion in this seat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a whole group of really corrupt billionaires who have really close attachment to the Trump administration, who want people who are going to be soft on their issues, and so that means people who are going to be OK with unconditional military aid in [Israel Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu’s war machine,\" Peters said. \"That means people who are going to be OK with the advancement of AI slop and the increase in utility rates. That means people who are OK with the corrupt practices of the crypto bros who have been literally benefiting from the Trump administration and I believe have played a role in Trump’s ability to gain more wealth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junaid Ahmed, a candidate in the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/what-to-know-about-illinois-8th-congressional-district-democratic-primary\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;8th Congressional District,&lt;/a&gt; is a progressive  endorsed by the Sunrise Movement, who is also railing against the influence of super PACs. He’s frustrated that mailers call Bean an “architect of Obamacare,” and reference a 2010 Chicago Tribune article about her role in Obamacare — though in reality the article discusses how she had not made a decision to sign the measure. Bean ultimately did support Obamacare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the part that dark money is doing here. When a voter sees that kind of bombardment, the shouting from the rooftops, that’s a direct impact,” Ahmed said. “And they’re able to by making ads on any topic that polls well — don’t even bring the word AI, don’t even bring the word AIPAC — just focus on what’s polling well and then bombard the voters, and then buy our races.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showalter, a former attorney for the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Justice Department counsel, believes publicly funding elections — and ending Citizens United — would make a huge difference in deflating the power of special interests. He credited New York City's program, in which candidates receive public funding that partially matches what they raise, for helping Zohran Mamdani win the mayoral seat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"You have a matching program where you raise up to a million dollars and it's matched eight-to-one,\" Showalter said. \"That makes a big difference for people who are candidates who are running in a grassroots publicly supported way, so that you don't have to rely on the millions and millions of dollars that can frankly only be deployed by giant corporate interests.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

At issue won’t be building a stadium, but the next step in what the Bears hope is a Super Bowl contender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are four things to watch this week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How will the Bears get under the salary cap?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears sit $4.1 million above the 2026 salary cap of $303.5 million, per Over the Cap, and have until the first day of the league year next month to get under it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the many ways for the Bears to get there, the cleanest would be to cut linebacker Tremaine Edmunds and save $15 million. Edmunds ranked second among all NFL linebackers in interceptions last year but the Bears fared well in his four-game injury absence, with backup D’Marco Jackson winning NFC Defensive Player of the Week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears could also restructure the contracts of receiver DJ Moore, guard Joe Thuney, defensive tackle Grady Jarrett and others to find extra cap space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Moore: Johnson and Poles will have a chance Tuesday to make a clear statement about how they value the receiver after he was part of what quarterback Caleb Williams called a miscommunication on the overtime interception against the Rams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears have praised Moore’s toughness and intelligence for years, but he’s coming off his worst statistical season with the team and has a $28.5 million salary cap hit in each of the next two years. The Bears won’t cut him, but he could be a trade candidate if they decide to go in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What to do at No. 25?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time the Bears arrived at the Combine without either a brand-new head coach or possession of the No. 1 overall draft pick was 2020. This year, then, will be different — picking 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; overall, the Bears will be at the mercy of how the draft board breaks in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears will need an edge rusher and a defensive tackle regardless of what happens in free agency, as well as someone to play left tackle in place of the injured Ozzy Trapilo. They could look to add a safety — or two — if both Kevin Byard and Jaquan Brisker leave via free agency.  The Bears want Byard back. Cornerback could be in play if Nahshon Wright goes elsewhere, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good news for the Bears: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/20/bears-nfl-draft-daniel-jeremiah-network-25-overall-defensive-end-left-tackle-good-spot-no-trade-scouting-combine-ryan-poles-ben-johnson\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;the draft is considered strong — and deep — at offensive tackle, defensive end and defensive tackle.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How about a trade?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade seeds get planted when teams — and agents — gather at the Combine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears solved two of their biggest needs in the days after the Combine last year when they traded draft picks for two guards — Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson — who went on to post exceptional seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the NFL will be searching for clarity about whether Raiders star edge rusher Maxx Crosby will be made available in a trade. Bears quarterback Caleb Williams &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/17/bears-raiders-caleb-williams-maxx-crosby-mutual-admiration-podcast-appearance-trade-nfl\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;appeared on Crosby’s podcast last week &lt;/a&gt;and praised both Johnson and Bears fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;And what about the staff?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears lost two offensive assistants to coordinator jobs this offseason. Declan Doyle took the same job with the Ravens, where he will be able to call plays. Running backs coach Eric Bieniemy became the Chiefs’ coordinator, though he won’t call plays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears promoted pass-game coordinator Press Taylor to offensive coordinator and hired Eric Studesville as running backs coach. This week will provide Johnson with the first chance to explain why he hired them — and how he plans to continue the momentum on his side of the ball.&lt;/p&gt;",
