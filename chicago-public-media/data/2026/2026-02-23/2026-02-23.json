Chaos ensued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giants second baseman &lt;b&gt;Luis Arraez&lt;/b&gt; barehanded the ball on the bounce and tossed it home, prompting Suzuki to race for second. Giants first baseman &lt;b&gt;Rafael Devers&lt;/b&gt; cut off the throw and fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw had stopped in his tracks around third, while Bregman kept his head down and ran. They ended up on the same base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I thought I got a good read off the bat,\" Bregman said, \"and then I should have ran a little bit more with my head up.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giants shortstop &lt;b&gt;Willy Adames&lt;/b&gt; ran over, tagged both runners, and handed the ball to third baseman &lt;b&gt;Matt Chapman&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew that, since I was the trail runner, I was out,” Bregman said. “But I’ve got to do a better job of just staying on the base, clarifying that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two outs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Bregman headed to the dugout, correct in his assessment of the play, Shaw had a brief conversation with third-base coach &lt;b&gt;Quintin Berry&lt;/b&gt;. Shaw stepped off the base, pulling off his sliding mitt and helmet as he talked. Chapman, still holding the ball, tagged him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three outs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know what happened,” Adames told Giants reporters. “That’s the beauty of baseball, I guess. Every day, you see something new.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Bregman: “We'll learn from it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Long set to see doctor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs hope that&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/21/how-tokyo-series-prepared-cubs-matthew-boyd-for-wbc-ramp-up\"   &gt; first baseman &lt;b&gt;Jonathon Long&lt;/b&gt;’s left elbow sprain &lt;/a&gt;isn’t serious enough to force him to withdraw from the World Baseball Classic, manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell&lt;/b&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long, a non-roster invitee, sustained the sprain Saturday in a collision Saturday during the Cubs’ game against the Rangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs shut him down from baseball activities Sunday, and he’s set to see a doctor Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He's sore today, and there's some swelling there today,” Counsell said. “But if it's just that, then, we're probably at two, three days [off] here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long was scheduled to leave Cubs camp this week to join Team Chinese Taipei for the WBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gold for USA&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs were gathered in their clubhouse Sunday morning, with the TVs turned to the men’s hockey Olympic gold medal game between the United States and Canada, when Jack Hughes’ “golden goal” delivered the victory to the stars and stripes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were all fired up,” said Bregman, who will be representing the US in the WBC this year. “We were going crazy in the clubhouse when we scored.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can that be replicated in the upcoming baseball tournament?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let's do it, let's go win,” Bregman said. “USA, baby.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

They were joined by Gov. JB Pritzker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes after a year of attacks on federal workers' unions from the Trump administration, including the cancellation of several standing contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group is pushing for higher pay, a higher annual uniform allowance and safety measures for postal workers in the field in this new round of bargaining, which is expected to begin Wednesday, according to Elise Foster, president of NALC Branch 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foster, a 30-year letter carrier from Pilsen, said postal workers often have to save up for years to get adequate uniforms to work outdoors through the city’s seasons. She said many union members are also concerned about safety after mail carrier Octavia Redmond was &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2024/10/01/boy-15-charged-with-fatally-shooting-postal-worker-octavia-redmond-west-pullman\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;fatally shot two years ago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are some of the top key items even just to retain employees,” Foster said. “No one do what we do, the way we do it, that’s why first-class service deserves first-class pay. … We have to deliver ourselves back home to our families.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-ff0000\" name=\"image-ff0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8f6f124/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F2c%2Fe25794db40b1a18d19ecd18f2eb1%2Fnalcrally-260223-05.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18f24ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F2c%2Fe25794db40b1a18d19ecd18f2eb1%2Fnalcrally-260223-05.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8b90d1e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd2%2F2c%2Fe25794db40b1a18d19ecd18f2eb1%2Fnalcrally-260223-05.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Gov.

DeJoy agreed to cut 10,000 letter carriers from the 640,000-person force and billions of dollars from the USPS budget&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has also repeatedly called for the privatization of USPS.
