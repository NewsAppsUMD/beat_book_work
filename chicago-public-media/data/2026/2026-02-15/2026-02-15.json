He left Cubs camp to pitch for Mexico and proved what a difference-maker he could be in a multi-inning relief role. He allowed only two hits in 5⅔ scoreless innings in the course of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Big moments against great teams,’’ Mexico manager &lt;b&gt;Benji Gil&lt;/b&gt; said of Assad’s outings against the United States in pool play and Puerto Rico in the quarterfinals. ‘‘There’s a handful of guys in the world that have faced the lineups he just faced and dominated.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the talk about the WBC centers on the honor the players feel to represent their countries and on the challenges the schedule presents as teams gear up for the regular season. For many players, however, the big-game atmosphere has its developmental advantages, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘If you can get to the final rounds, those games are just so much fun that you get to re-create feelings that you have in October games,’’ Cubs manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell&lt;/b&gt; said. ‘‘And those are invaluable experiences.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WBC has more MLB star power this year than ever — quite literally. A record 78 MLB All-Stars, including 36 who got the nod last season, were featured on rosters as of Feb. 5. Thirteen players from the Cubs’ organization are set to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assad is one of them, and he’s expected to play an even larger role for Mexico in this tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Last time, it was a really great experience, really happy with it,’’ Assad said through an interpreter. ‘‘And I’ll go on to this one looking for new goals in the tournament.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Gil: ‘‘I’m just really looking forward to him pitching for us and then afterwards going and establishing himself as one of the better pitchers in the National League.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Outfield competition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs’ position-player group is largely set, but the competition for bench roles — and particularly a potential spot for a fourth outfielder — will be something to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matt Shaw&lt;/b&gt; has been taking fly balls in the outfield in preparation for a super-utility role and certainly will factor into the equation. Outside of the Cubs’ three regular starters — left fielder &lt;b&gt;Ian Happ&lt;/b&gt;, center fielder &lt;b&gt;Pete Crow-Armstrong&lt;/b&gt; and right fielder &lt;b&gt;Seiya Suzuki&lt;/b&gt; — the Cubs have five other outfielders in camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kevin Alcantara&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Justin Dean&lt;/b&gt;, whom the Cubs claimed off waivers this offseason, are on the 40-man roster. &lt;b&gt;Brett Bateman&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Dylan Carlson&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Chas McCormick&lt;/b&gt; are non-roster invitees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tyler Austin&lt;/b&gt; has played outfield in his career and likely will take fly balls as the Cubs make contingency plans, but Counsell said he sees Austin more as a first baseman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lefty options&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs’ bullpen featured three left-handers for stretches of last season, giving Counsell more options against left-handed-heavy lineups. They have five left-handed relievers in camp this year, including returnee &lt;b&gt;Caleb Thielbar&lt;/b&gt; and offseason additions &lt;b&gt;Hoby Milner&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Ryan Rolison&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

And they were rewarded with cookies, a heart-shaped box of chocolates, lollipops and s’mores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though participants admitted to the stress-relief benefits of the activity, no one was especially angry or broken-hearted. They were more interested in the opportunity to spend Valentine’s Day in a unique way and do their part to help the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don't do Valentine's Day, so this is great,” said Kathy Nagy, 62, of the South Loop, who attended with her husband, Michael. “It's a Hallmark holiday. You go out to dinner and get ushered out within 45 minutes because everybody has a waiting list. It's overpriced.

Clearing the invasive tree allows bottlebrush, wood reed grass and Joy Pyre weed to flourish in the soil and toads, frogs and salamanders to thrive in the pond. The volunteers made an impressive amount of headway toward this effort at Saturday’s event, which was marketed in a playful way to entice people to experience the natural areas in their communities, said Evelyn Alvarez, the coordinator of conservation action at Shedd Aquarium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's a really fun and engaging way to get people to learn about the harmful things in our environment, what they can do to make an impact for their local spaces, and also a really great way to connect with other people with similar interests,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antonio Marquez and Kayla Reum said throwing the trees on the fire was the best part of the day. The two teenagers attended with a group of friends. Reum dyed her hair pink for the occasion, and Marquez’s jeans with flaming pink hearts were chosen unintentionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-5c0000\" name=\"image-5c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a0bef5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/94c9c38/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c43153/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Antonio Marquez (right) throws a piece of European buckthorn into a pile after cutting it on Valentine’s Day during Shedd Aquarium’s volunteer action days at LaGrange Park Woods in La Grange, Ill., Saturday, Feb. 14, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c43153/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18152b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c43153/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antonio Marquez (right) throws a piece of European buckthorn into a pile after cutting it on Valentine’s Day. “I’m just trying to do my part for the community,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m just trying to do my part for the community,” said Marquez, 19, of La Grange Park. “It’s nice to come out here and make a difference.

I usually lead crews. And not everybody likes that in a woman.
