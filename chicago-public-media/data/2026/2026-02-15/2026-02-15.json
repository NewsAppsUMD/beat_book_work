He left Cubs camp to pitch for Mexico and proved what a difference-maker he could be in a multi-inning relief role. He allowed only two hits in 5⅔ scoreless innings in the course of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Big moments against great teams,’’ Mexico manager &lt;b&gt;Benji Gil&lt;/b&gt; said of Assad’s outings against the United States in pool play and Puerto Rico in the quarterfinals. ‘‘There’s a handful of guys in the world that have faced the lineups he just faced and dominated.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the talk about the WBC centers on the honor the players feel to represent their countries and on the challenges the schedule presents as teams gear up for the regular season. For many players, however, the big-game atmosphere has its developmental advantages, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘If you can get to the final rounds, those games are just so much fun that you get to re-create feelings that you have in October games,’’ Cubs manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell&lt;/b&gt; said. ‘‘And those are invaluable experiences.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WBC has more MLB star power this year than ever — quite literally. A record 78 MLB All-Stars, including 36 who got the nod last season, were featured on rosters as of Feb. 5. Thirteen players from the Cubs’ organization are set to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assad is one of them, and he’s expected to play an even larger role for Mexico in this tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Last time, it was a really great experience, really happy with it,’’ Assad said through an interpreter. ‘‘And I’ll go on to this one looking for new goals in the tournament.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Gil: ‘‘I’m just really looking forward to him pitching for us and then afterwards going and establishing himself as one of the better pitchers in the National League.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Outfield competition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs’ position-player group is largely set, but the competition for bench roles — and particularly a potential spot for a fourth outfielder — will be something to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matt Shaw&lt;/b&gt; has been taking fly balls in the outfield in preparation for a super-utility role and certainly will factor into the equation. Outside of the Cubs’ three regular starters — left fielder &lt;b&gt;Ian Happ&lt;/b&gt;, center fielder &lt;b&gt;Pete Crow-Armstrong&lt;/b&gt; and right fielder &lt;b&gt;Seiya Suzuki&lt;/b&gt; — the Cubs have five other outfielders in camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kevin Alcantara&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Justin Dean&lt;/b&gt;, whom the Cubs claimed off waivers this offseason, are on the 40-man roster. &lt;b&gt;Brett Bateman&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Dylan Carlson&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Chas McCormick&lt;/b&gt; are non-roster invitees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tyler Austin&lt;/b&gt; has played outfield in his career and likely will take fly balls as the Cubs make contingency plans, but Counsell said he sees Austin more as a first baseman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lefty options&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs’ bullpen featured three left-handers for stretches of last season, giving Counsell more options against left-handed-heavy lineups. They have five left-handed relievers in camp this year, including returnee &lt;b&gt;Caleb Thielbar&lt;/b&gt; and offseason additions &lt;b&gt;Hoby Milner&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Ryan Rolison&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

And they were rewarded with cookies, a heart-shaped box of chocolates, lollipops and s’mores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though participants admitted to the stress-relief benefits of the activity, no one was especially angry or broken-hearted. They were more interested in the opportunity to spend Valentine’s Day in a unique way and do their part to help the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don't do Valentine's Day, so this is great,” said Kathy Nagy, 62, of the South Loop, who attended with her husband, Michael. “It's a Hallmark holiday. You go out to dinner and get ushered out within 45 minutes because everybody has a waiting list. It's overpriced.

Clearing the invasive tree allows bottlebrush, wood reed grass and Joy Pyre weed to flourish in the soil and toads, frogs and salamanders to thrive in the pond. The volunteers made an impressive amount of headway toward this effort at Saturday’s event, which was marketed in a playful way to entice people to experience the natural areas in their communities, said Evelyn Alvarez, the coordinator of conservation action at Shedd Aquarium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's a really fun and engaging way to get people to learn about the harmful things in our environment, what they can do to make an impact for their local spaces, and also a really great way to connect with other people with similar interests,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antonio Marquez and Kayla Reum said throwing the trees on the fire was the best part of the day. The two teenagers attended with a group of friends. Reum dyed her hair pink for the occasion, and Marquez’s jeans with flaming pink hearts were chosen unintentionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-5c0000\" name=\"image-5c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a0bef5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/94c9c38/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c43153/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Antonio Marquez (right) throws a piece of European buckthorn into a pile after cutting it on Valentine’s Day during Shedd Aquarium’s volunteer action days at LaGrange Park Woods in La Grange, Ill., Saturday, Feb. 14, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c43153/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18152b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c43153/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antonio Marquez (right) throws a piece of European buckthorn into a pile after cutting it on Valentine’s Day. “I’m just trying to do my part for the community,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m just trying to do my part for the community,” said Marquez, 19, of La Grange Park. “It’s nice to come out here and make a difference.

Last year, the cancer progressed to stage 4 and she began receiving chemotherapy treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day after she was released for the weekend from Lurie Children's Hospital to see family and friends in mid-October, her father, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/25/ruben-torres-maldonado-daughter-battling-cancer-judge-ruling\"   &gt;Ruben Torres Maldonado, was detained&lt;/a&gt; by ICE agents in Niles. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.suntimeswire.com/2025/10/25/ruben-torres-maldonado-daughter-battling-cancer-judge-ruling\"   &gt;Doctors said&lt;/a&gt; she was unable to continue treatment \"because of the stress and disruption\" caused by the arrest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following widespread demands for his release, including  &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reels/DP-PGMHjWQ-/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;a video made by Ofelia&lt;/a&gt; on social media, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/30/chicago-father-of-teen-battling-rare-cancer-ordered-released-from-ice-custody\"   &gt;Maldonado was released on bond&lt;/a&gt; from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention in late-October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Ofelia was heroic and brave in the face of ICE's detention and threatened deportation of her father,\" said Kalman Resnick, the attorney representing Torres, in a statement Saturday. \"We mourn Ofelia's passing, and we hope that she will serve as a model for us all for how to be courageous and to fight for what's right to our last breaths.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, an immigration judge in Chicago conditionally entitled her father to receive a \"cancellation of removal,\" due to the impact his deportation would have on his children who are citizens in the U.S. According to the news release, this would provide him with a pathway to lawful permanent residency and eventually U.S. citizenship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ofelia was able to watch her father's hearing via Zoom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-with-ofelia-support-her-family-now\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; page was started for Ofelia in October and has collected more than $119,000. &lt;/p&gt;",

We peck on the lips, hug and hold hands, but we have had only one real kiss so far. Rita was first married for 22 years to an emotionally abusive man and then remarried to a manipulative one. She said we were going too fast and she wanted to slow down. I understood and have exerted no pressure on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rita has canceled dates for various reasons and gone silent for a day here and there. She says she's not talking to anyone else, and neither am I. I have told her she is worth the wait. I have fallen hard for her and have serious intentions about her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rita says she has strong feelings for me and that I treat her better than any man she has ever been involved with, but she doesn't know how to handle the feelings. How long should I give her to figure out what she wants this relationship to be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not worried about sex or anything like that, but four months without even calling us \"dating\" or \"girlfriend and boyfriend\" has me worried that I am, for a lack of a better description, wasting my time with her. What would you advise me to do? — &lt;i&gt;TAKING IT SLOW IN VIRGINIA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR TAKING IT SLOW:&lt;/b&gt; Continue allowing your relationship with Rita to develop slowly. The woman has had two unsuccessful marriages, so it's no wonder she's slow to commit. If, after a year (eight months from now), Rita still feels uncomfortable calling you \"boyfriend\" or \"companion,\" revisit the conversation and decide then if you have invested enough time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; After reading so many horrible letters sent to you from people about their mothers-in-law, I feel compelled to write to you about mine. I met her 43 years ago when I was dating her oldest son (now my husband). From the moment we met, she treated me with caring, acceptance and love. She and my father-in-law raised five amazing children, and they treated their children's spouses as if we were their own. She devoted her entire life to caring for and nurturing her husband, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we just lost this beautiful woman at the age of 89 to a long and difficult battle with Parkinson's and dementia. We watched her \"sparkle\" slowly fade away, but we will carry her amazing legacy with us always. I hope I can be half the MIL to my children's spouses that she was to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also hope that all those who aren't as lucky as I was can find some common ground with their mothers-in-law — especially if there are children involved. I LOVE YOU, MOM! — &lt;i&gt;FORTUNATE IN NEW YORK&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR FORTUNATE:&lt;/b&gt; Thank you for sharing this beautiful tribute to a woman who made such a positive difference in the lives of those she touched. Not only were you fortunate to be a member of such a warm and loving family, but she was also lucky to have a daughter-in-law like you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

year&lt;/a&gt; to try to force the agency to lift the brick on the contracts, saying the company “has a clear legal right” to the ones on hold, with IDOT “legally required to award” them “to Builders Paving within 45 days of bid submission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no justification under the Illinois Procurement Code or applicable regulations for IDOT to withhold awarding the Contracts,” and Builders could suffer “irreparable injury” if there’s “an indeterminate, unexplained and unjustified delay in the award of millions of dollars in Contracts to Builders Paving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2026/01/09/cook-county-judge-sebastian-sam-palumbo-gandy-builders-paving-illinois-department-of-transportation\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;a Cook County judge ruled otherwise&lt;/a&gt;, writing: “The Court finds that the provisions highlighted by IDOT negate the existence of a ministerial obligation to award the contracts by providing that no bidder has a right to a State contract absent execution, that the State is under no obligation to issue an award, and that IDOT retains authority to reject any or all bids or cancel a solicitation in the State’s best interests.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Builders attorney William Dwyer Jr. told the Chicago Sun-Times that the company hasn’t filed an appeal, but has filed paperwork signaling the intent to do so “to preserve its right to appeal the judge’s ruling.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"

Spying \"fifteen Celtic gentlemen with black carpet-sacks\" at a railroad junction, Lincoln follows them, spying while the Irish workers hang around a saloon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d10000\" name=\"image-d10000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fafa274/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x673+0+652/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Fb1%2Fcc27b86844aa90c7a1d415e36d1e%2Flopsided-lincoln.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/27f5428/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x673+0+652/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Fb1%2Fcc27b86844aa90c7a1d415e36d1e%2Flopsided-lincoln.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6e252cb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x673+0+652/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Fb1%2Fcc27b86844aa90c7a1d415e36d1e%2Flopsided-lincoln.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Abraham Lincoln, shown in a Nov. 8, 1863 file photo. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6e252cb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x673+0+652/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Fb1%2Fcc27b86844aa90c7a1d415e36d1e%2Flopsided-lincoln.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/76d2a87/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x673+0+652/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Fb1%2Fcc27b86844aa90c7a1d415e36d1e%2Flopsided-lincoln.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6e252cb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x673+0+652/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Fb1%2Fcc27b86844aa90c7a1d415e36d1e%2Flopsided-lincoln.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abraham Lincoln, shown in a Nov. 8, 1863 file photo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Gardner/AP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lincoln also tags after U.S. Sen. Stephen Douglas, tracking him like a campaign staffer doing opposition research, offering on-the-spot rebuttals — leading to the famous Lincoln-Douglas debates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slave-owning Douglas might remind readers of a more contemporary politician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Douglas began the debates with a series of lies,\" Pinsker writes. \"He repeated charges from the 1856 campaign, long since repudiated ... then claiming to read directly from the platforms of the 'Black Republican Party' adopted at the state fair in Springfield in October, 1854... He tried taunting Lincoln if he still believed in such radical ideas, before pivoting to a series of ugly questions about race.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching Americans argue today over the obvious — Is climate change real? Do vaccines work? Should immigrants be treated humanely? — it might offer some small comfort to remember the nation once agonized over whether a person should be consigned to a life of cruel bondage because his grandmother was Black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Douglas tried to leap ahead, past the unsettled slavery question, and abuse his opponents with then-unimaginable images of a mixed society, leading to Lincoln's famous retort, blasting the \"counterfeit logic\" that \"because I do not want a black woman for a &lt;i&gt;slave&lt;/i&gt; I must necessarily want her for a &lt;i&gt;wife&lt;/i&gt;\" and noting, with surprising candor, that if Douglas was worried about race mixing, it was to be found in the rape culture of Southern slavery, not in the hazy future prospect of intermarriage with free Blacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No book is perfect, and Pinsker, when focusing on certain grassroots political machinations, sometimes gets down on his knees to explore a situation, blade by blade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fate of a single subcabinet post — commissionership of the General Land Office — is battled over for nearly 20 pages. The Gettysburg Address merits only three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said,\"Boss Lincoln\" is history at its most fresh, real and relevant — maybe too relevant, considering that a gifted, eloquent unifier like Lincoln, a skilled lawyer, dedicated to his party and country, nevertheless presided over a fratricidal Civil War that killed 600,000 Americans. What will a man who cares neither for party nor country,  a sinkhole of ego, self-dealing and heedless of the law, lead us to?&lt;/p&gt;",

Maggie O’Farrell’s 2020 book about the Bard’s first wife, Agnes Hathaway, and the plague death of their 11-year-old boy Hamnet is the basis of both an Oscar-nominated movie and an award-winning stage drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a moving, compelling production, the stage adaptation by Lolita Chakrabarti is making its North American premiere at Chicago Shakespeare Theatre in a co-production with Stratford-on-Avon’s Royal Shakespeare Theatre and Neal Productions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamnet Shakespeare died in 1596, about five years before his father’s epic tragedy “Hamlet” premiered. O’Farrell’s book revealed the deep connective tissue between the tragedy of “Hamlet” and the tragedy of Hamnet — names that were seen as identical in 16th-century England. Chakrabarti’s stage adaptation of the book captures tragedy and comedy, breathing life into the circumstances that helped inspire one of the greatest plays ever written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RatingCard Enhancement\" data-module data-rating=\"3.5\"  data-align-center&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RatingCard-title\"&gt;\n        ‘Hamnet’\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    &lt;div class=\"RatingCard-content\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-350000\" name=\"module-350000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;When:&lt;/b&gt; Through March 8&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt; Chicago Shakespeare Theatre, 800 E.

Like “Hamlet,” “Hamnet” is a tragedy where romance curdles amid devastation, comedy blooms until tragedy snuffs it and somehow ends with hope. It’s a biting rom-com early on, a quill-to-the-heart later. “Hamnet” is also graced with snippets from Shakespeare’s plays — Whyman’s ensemble cast makes the words pierce and sing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The production has an ethereal glow to it, opening on a pair of whispering, spectral children who punctuate the drama like waking dreams. That same luminosity infuses William (Rory Alexander) and Agnes’ (Kemi-Bo Jacobs) first meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander and Jacobs have scalding chemistry from the moment they lock eyes. They might be talking about kestrels, but the subtext and innuendo are thick enough to cut with a rapier. (Speaking of: Like most Shakespeare plays, there’s a killer swordfighting scene in “Hamnet.”) Their journey of loving, grieving, shattering and (maybe) recovering unfolds between London and Stratford over the course of the production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacobs travels an epic arc as wild joy is overcome by unbearable sorrow. She holds nothing back, cycling through arcs of ecstasy to agony and back, each step ringing true. Agnes is thought to be a witch by the townsfolk in Stratford; it’s a dangerous rumor given that tens of thousands of women were executed for witchcraft in Europe between the late 16th and the early 17th centuries. William and Agnes couldn’t care less — they’re gloriously ardent, soulmates who won’t be told otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-880000\" name=\"image-880000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc7e2e0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8c%2F77%2F1f62e9014040a6ef9fa65002801e%2F3-cst-hamnet-kyleflubacker.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c25cd6e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8c%2F77%2F1f62e9014040a6ef9fa65002801e%2F3-cst-hamnet-kyleflubacker.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bd8a70a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8c%2F77%2F1f62e9014040a6ef9fa65002801e%2F3-cst-hamnet-kyleflubacker.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\" Kemi-Bo Jacobs and Rory Alexander as Agnes and William Shakespeare in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s Hamnet, based on the novel by Maggie O’Farrell, adapted by Lolita Chakrabarti, and directed by Erica Whyman.

The love of his life isn’t just Agnes, it’s also his work. The twined priorities come with a steep price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Hamnet, (Ajani Cabey) takes on some of the most moving passages in “Hamlet.” His delivery of a slice from Hamlet’s second act soliloquy (“What a piece of work is man”) is remarkably moving — so much so that you’ll want nothing more to see Cabey perform the role in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a similar moment with Nigel Barrett, playing Shakespearean actor Will Kempe playing “Bottom” in a rehearsal for “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Barrett’s depiction of the rustic-turned-ass is so funny you don’t want the rehearsal to end. Barrett is also notable as Will’s abusive, impoverished, glovemaker father John. His declaration that glovemaking is God’s work is bloviating at its comical best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there’s always another side to the comedy in “Hamnet.” It’s exemplified in an early scene between Hamnet and his twin sister Judith (Saffron Dey) as they play a practical joke. It's a light-hearted moment, but as becomes clear much later, it foreshadows Hamnet’s agonized death with haunting specificity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Piper’s wood-and-rope set (he also did the understated, historically accurate costumes) bears the skeletal shape of Globe Theatre, owned partly by Shakespeare and built to stage his plays. Chicago Shakes’ Yard space has a similar configuration as the Globe — watching “Hamlet” unfold as a play-within-the-play feels like sitting on the other side of a mirror in a time machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-330000\" name=\"image-330000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc1be28/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F81%2F1a%2Ff1c31f524cf1b7424d5b8639cc9d%2F6-cst-hamnet-kyleflubacker.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/92ede56/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F81%2F1a%2Ff1c31f524cf1b7424d5b8639cc9d%2F6-cst-hamnet-kyleflubacker.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9005eb0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F81%2F1a%2Ff1c31f524cf1b7424d5b8639cc9d%2F6-cst-hamnet-kyleflubacker.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Saffron Dey as Judith and Ajani Cabey as Hamnet in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s Hamnet, \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9005eb0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F81%2F1a%2Ff1c31f524cf1b7424d5b8639cc9d%2F6-cst-hamnet-kyleflubacker.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/82603c0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F81%2F1a%2Ff1c31f524cf1b7424d5b8639cc9d%2F6-cst-hamnet-kyleflubacker.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9005eb0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F81%2F1a%2Ff1c31f524cf1b7424d5b8639cc9d%2F6-cst-hamnet-kyleflubacker.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saffron Dey portrays Judith and Ajani Cabey is Hamnet in the Royal Shakespeare Company’s “Hamnet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyle Flubacker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout, Oguz Kaplangi’s score and Ayse Tashkiran’s movement design help make the production its often ethereal feel. Scenes don’t change so much as they dissolve and emerge like fever dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all is perfect: The closed captioning on either side of the stage is helpful — there are thick accents at work — but having to toggle between stage and screen disrupts the drama’s intensity. If you aren’t already familiar with the story of Hamnet, Will and Agnes, the early, atmospheric scenes will take a moment to make narrative sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O’Farrell’s book is historical fiction. Chakrabarti’s adaptation captures both real and speculative worlds with power and heart. Both are more than evident at Chicago Shakes.&lt;/p&gt;",

The brackets are set throughout the state in every class. If the seeds and highest ranked teams were all to advance to Champaign on the final weekend of the season, here is how the state semifinals in the two largest classes would look:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Class 4A: Curie vs. Homewood-Flossmoor; DePaul Prep vs. Benet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Class 3A: St. Viator vs. Kankakee; Hyde Park vs. East St. Louis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. There are clearly coaches who still only look at win totals and award seeds to the teams with the most — even if it’s simply a one or two-win difference. It’s easy and lazy for the coach and it really cost a few deserving teams in the seeding process this past week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. The Loyola Sectional has the most ranked teams of any sectional with six: DePaul, Evanston, Loyola, St. Patrick, New Trier and Lincoln Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. The sectional with the most teams with winning records? That would be the 4A Mount Carmel Sectional with 13 teams above the .500 mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Regionals typically bring rematches and rivalries. There isn’t a rivalry that surpasses the Notre Dame-St. Patrick one that will play out in a regional semifinal at New Trier. Will they fill the place as they do during the regular season?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. There is the potential for so many rematches in regional championship games if games play out how they’re projected to, starting with a trio of 4 vs. 5 seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those three games include: Batavia and Wheaton South playing a third time this season and just one week after facing one another in the regular-season finale; St. Laurence and Mount Carmel squaring off in a Catholic League rematch; and Brother Rice and Joliet West, who met way back in November, playing again three months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuKane Conference teams Glenbard North and Wheaton North meet up this week to finish up the regular season. They are projected to meet for a third time in the regional championship one week later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If No. 9 Glenbard West can pull off a minor upset over No. 7 Leyden, the Hilltoppers would play No. 2 seed York for the third time on its home floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandburg, No. 8 seed playing the regional on its home floor, played Homewood-Flossmoor pretty tough in two conference matchups this season. They could get a third crack at top-seeded H-F in the regional championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barrington has struggled this season. But the Broncos played Palatine tough in a 52-51 January loss. As the No. 2 and No. 7 seeds, they are expected to meet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And two other Mid-Suburban League teams, Hersey and Rolling Meadows, are expected to meet after splitting their two regular-season games this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in January, No. 2 seed Evanston handled No. 7 Niles North in a 80-64 win. A likely rematch awaits in the regional championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. With the return of Christopher Kirkpatrick this past weekend from injury –– and the instant impact he made with 24 points in a win over Evanston –– New Trier is the best No. 5 seed in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. You really have to search for potential competitive regional semifinal games involving top four seeds. High-seeded teams matched up against double-digit seeds generally don’t produce a whole lot of drama. But there are a few that could prove to be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No high-seeded team wants to play its biggest rival in the first game of state tournament play. That’s what St. Patrick, the No. 4 seed, gets when it faces Notre Dame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glenbrook South has had an uncharacteristically down year. But always well coached and playing on its home floor, No. 14 seed Glenbrook South could be problematic for third-seeded Loyola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. 4 seed Brother Rice must play 16-win Richards, a team it beat 50-41 just this past week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mount Carmel, another No. 4 seed, must play on the road at Hinsdale Central, a disciplined team that has knocked off Oak Lawn (24 wins) and Downers Grove South (21 wins) while playing a very competitive schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Simeon as a No. 11 seed is wild. The Wolverines earned that 11 seed, but simply seeing that seed attached to this program is like a high school basketball ultra reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The realization this program is up against it in winning a regional title has officially set in. Simeon has never lost in a regional since Bob Hambric took over the program in 1980. That streak dates back 45 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simeon will need to beat No. 6 seed Riverside-Brookfield and likely Whitney Young to continue that phenomenal run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. The teams seeded 1 through 8 are expected to meet in regional title games. But the most dangerous team outside the top eight seeds is No. 9 Lyons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lions, who impressed in the summer and came into the season with some high expectations, fell off the map a bit after hitting a midseason lull. But a reborn Lyons team is now 19-6 and has won eight straight and 10 of its last 11. There is talent, size and length on a team that will pose a threat to any team seeded higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11. There are several basketball programs in positions they are not accustomed to being in at this time of the year. But none more so than Joliet Catholic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hilltoppers are the No. 1 seed in the Hinsdale South Sectional. It’s been 38 years since the last time the Hilltoppers won a sectional championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joliet Catholic, which has won 17 games and are in fifth place in the East Suburban Catholic Conference, have had just one 20-win season in 45 years. With three regular-season games remaining, a regional championship will undoubtedly get them their second 20-win season in four-plus decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12. The landscape outside the Chicago area is pretty enticing and intriguing along one state tournament road in Class 3A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;East St. Louis (25-3), the top-ranked team in Class 3A, and No. 5 ranked Centralia (27-1) are on a collision course to meet in the sectional championship game at Waterloo. The winner would then likely face Decatur MacArthur (28-1), the No. 4 ranked team in the Springfield Super.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither East St. Louis or MacArthur have lost to an in-state team all season. Centralia’s only loss came to Marist in December.&lt;/p&gt;",

The Condors opened the season with high expectations and ranked No. 11 in the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/super-25-basketball-rankings/2026/02/08/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;Super 25&lt;/a&gt; but they have outperformed everyone's expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coach Mike Oliver's team is 24-1 and will play in the Public League semifinals at UIC on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curie has won 14 consecutive games since losing to Benet in the Pontiac Holiday Tournament on Dec. 31. And the Condors have done it against one of the strongest schedules any team has played in several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly every game Curie played in the regular season was against a quality opponent. The all-senior starting lineup of Justin Oliver, Mike Oliver Jr., Kendall Holiday, Saquan Commings and Josh Hurley doesn't boast a single college-bound player yet; they just win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Condors beat nine teams that have appeared in the Super 25 this season: Warren, Oswego East, St. Ignatius, Lockport, New Trier, St. Patrick, Bolingbrook, Thornwood and Hillcrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Sunday afternoon, the Public League had not determined the matchups for Wednesday's city tournament semifinals. It is unbelievable that a tournament featuring nearly 100 teams did not have a set format before it started, but that appears to be the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyde Park, Kenwood and Lincoln Park also advanced to the final four. Curie will be a heavy favorite against whichever team it plays on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Condors lost to Kenwood in the city title game last year and beat Kenwood to win the city title in 2024. Curie also won city championships in 2019 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Super 25 updates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Trier vaulted from No. 20 to No. 12 this week. The Trevians beat Evanston on Friday, but that is only part of the story. Princeton recruit Christopher Kirkpatrick, one of the the best players in the state, has returned from an injury suffered back in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirkpatrick scored 24 points against the Wildkits and hit the game-winning shot. New Trier was holding its own without the talented guard, but his return raises the Trevians’ ceiling significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Trier is the No. 5 seed in the Class 4A Loyola sectional. The Trevians will host the regional. They open against Payton and then could host St. Patrick in the regional final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leo drops out of the rankings after losing to Rich and Marmion. Lockport falls out after losing at Sandburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Public League teams, Kenwood and Hyde Park, join the Super 25. Kenwood played well for long stretches of the season and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2026/02/14/kenwood-basketball-chicago-young\"   &gt;knocked off Young&lt;/a&gt; on the road on Saturday. Hyde Park has won nine consecutive games against in-state opponents since losing to St. Patrick on Jan. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a down year for Public League basketball overall, so placing five teams in the rankings in mid-February was unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Super 25 high school basketball rankings for Feb. 15, 2026&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With record and last week's ranking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.

Just true Daytona madness,” Reddick said. “I’ve already lost my voice from screaming. Never thought I’d be Daytona 500 champion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither did Jordan, who met Reddick in victory lane for a bear hug and the two then jointly hoisted the Harley J. Earl trophy into the air. Jordan, who turns 63 on Tuesday, will get a Daytona 500 ring for his birthday and made it known in victory lane he wears a size 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It feels like I won a championship, but until I get my ring, I won't even know,” Jordan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a celebration that included multiple stars of NASCAR as Reddick is teammates with Bubba Wallace, who went to victory lane in tears after dominating a huge chunk of the race but finishing 10th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan wrapped his arms around Wallace from behind and spoke closely into Wallace's ear in a brief speech of encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t want my emotions to take away from the monumental day they just accomplished. Happy birthday, MJ. That’s a massive birthday present,” Wallace said. “I thought this was our week, the best 500 I’ve ever had, and come up short, sucks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Led a lot of laps, lap leader, I believe. It was a good day for us, but damn. Try again next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamlin was also in victory lane after finishing 31st and falling short in his bid to become the third four-time Daytona 500 winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamlin, who drives for Joe Gibbs Racing, was involved in the final caution when he and teammate Christopher Bell collided with nine laps remaining. It set up the final push to the finish over the final four laps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliott had control on the final lap after leader Carson Hocevar was spun off the track and it appeared the son of NASCAR Hall of Famer Bill Elliott would finally win his first Daytona 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Reddick made a huge surge, hit Elliott to cause Elliott to crash and sailed past to give Jordan a victory in NASCAR's bigggest event of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan was the face of the December federal antitrust lawsuit that NASCAR settled on the ninth day of trial. The settlement changed the revenue-sharing model in the United States' top motorsports series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan watched the win from a suite overlooking the superspeedway built by the France family he just beat in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t even believe it. It was so gratifying,” Jordan said. “You never know how these races are going to end. You just try to survive. We hung in there all day. Great strategy by the team, and we gave ourselves a chance at the end. Look, I’m ecstatic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The victory marked a Daytona sweep for three team owners heavily involved in the trial. Bob Jenkins, who joined 23XI in suing NASCAR, opened the weekend with a victory when Chandler Smith won the Truck Series opener on Friday night for Front Row Motorsports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Childress, who testified on behalf of 23XI and Front Row and was the subject of disparaging text messages by since-departed NASCAR chairman Steve Phelps, was the winning team owner Saturday when Austin Hill won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came “The Great American Race” and Jordan and Hamlin, the two front-facing litigants got their first Daytona 500 victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former race winners Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Joey Logano finished second and third as Toyota, Chevrolet and Ford each placed a driver on the podium. Elliott wound up fourth and sat dejected and in disbelief on the outside wall of the track after climbing from his car.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We ended up kind of getting gifted the lead ... and then at that point in time, you’re just on defense. Man, that’s a really, really tough place to be, truthfully,” Elliott said. \"Obviously looking back, you can run it through your mind 1,000 times, do you do something different -- I feel like if I had thrown a double block on (Reddick), probably would have just crashed us at that point in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I felt like you had to pick your battles.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

He’s very friendly, so I’m sure he’ll make it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takatsu saw Murakami at his zenith in Japan, when he hit 56 home runs, drove in 134 runs and posted a 1.168 OPS in 141 games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to say that he’ll do the same here,” Takatsu said through a translator. “But he’s a home run hitter. He did very well in Japan, so I think he’ll do well here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takatsu acknowledged that it could take a while for Murakami to adjust to workouts and daily life in the States but knows the Sox have developed a reputation for taking care of Japanese players like himself and Tadahito Iguchi, a staple of the Sox’s 2005 World Series championship team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for adjusting to pitching and managing to a media job, Takatsu quipped, “I’d rather be wear a uniform.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takatsu and Kaz Matsui, who played seven seasons with the Mets, Rockies and Astros, were among the former major leaguers from Japan who watched Murakami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are getting an understanding of how big of a deal Mune is,” Sox manager Will Venable said “Certainly, the attention he gets is well deserved for what he’s accomplished.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venable wasn’t sure if Murakami would start at first base in Friday’s exhibition opener against the Cubs in Mesa, but he intends to give him and a few others players game opportunities before they depart for the World Baseball Classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Will power&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venable addressed expectations in a meeting prior to the first full-squad workout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We told these guys there is no limit to what we believe they can do,” Venable said. “It’s about them and our support of helping them realize the belief that we have in this club.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workouts have been staggered into four groups starting their work 20 minutes apart before reuniting for team fundamental drills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There will be lots of time for these guys to be on the field together, and some of the veteran guys and younger guys will be able to pick each other’s brains,” Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crash course in center&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luisangel Acuña has played all but three of his 580 major league innings in the infield, yet he is eager to show his talents in center field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To be honest with you, I feel more comfortable playing in center field,” said Acuña, who was acquired last month for Luis Robert Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acuña said he noticed a difference during his brief time in center for Texas’ Double-A Frisco affiliate. He also 17 games in center in the Venezuelan Winter League prior to his trade from the Mets to Sox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to play whatever they ask me to play, and I’ll be ready for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infielder Lenyn Sosa (birth of child) and Acuña (visa paperwork) didn’t partake in the entire workout because they didn’t arrive until Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to make sure we are getting them off on the right foot and be mindful of what they have been through these last couple of days with their travel,” Venable said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Colson is no different in that regard. He’s built for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery’s offseason simulated his regular season preparation from a hitting standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 6-3 Montgomery, who appears lighter than his listed 230 pounds, reviewed videos of his swing and decisions with director of hitting Ryan Fuller and new hitting coach Derek Shoman. They did not overlook his 29.2 percent strikeout rate, his 69.6 percent contact rate or his 28.2 percent rate on chasing pitches outside the strike zone, according to Statcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that was only part of his offseason work. Montgomery batted .286 on breaking pitches but only .238 on fastballs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They told me to just do more competitive machine work (with) high velocity,” Montgomery said. “I felt like I hit high velocity pretty good, but you can always improve in this game and keep getting better. That was one of the biggest things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From my overall background, I’m a competitor, so they wanted me to do a lot more competition stuff. It just makes my intent a lot higher in the cage other than if you are just doing normal flips in (batting practice).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scrutiny on Montgomery’s offensive breakout (following a two-week reset with Fuller in Arizona) overshadowed his dependability at shortstop that quelled questions about whether his long-range future was at third base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venable relishes defensively versatility but expects Montgomery to play short at least 90 percent of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery’s more direct path to fielding grounders was a pleasant improvement - especially to scouts who saw him take a slightly circular route in the Arizona Fall League in 2023-24, instead of fielding them directly in line with his right throwing shoulder and requiring less time to throw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery was credited with seven defensive runs saved last year, and he credited infield coach Justin Jirschele with pregame preparation and helping his internal clock on grounders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reading how hard the ball is hit to you and doing your scouting on the runner is one of the first things that Jirsch tells us,” Montgomery said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“(If) there’s a guy that really gets out of the box well, you only have one or two shuffles, and you got to get rid of the ball. That’s (why) I prioritize is the inner clock.

Jakucionis, whose minutes have been increasing lately, had back-to-back six-three-pointer games. Riley averaged 20.5 points over four straight games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both of them — such talent — were in the house, seated together, Sunday as the Illini manhandled Indiana 71-51 at State Farm Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also kicking around Champaign for most of the last week was Terrance Shannon Jr., the ex-Illini All-American who has alternated between the Timberwolves and their G League squad since going 27th in the 2024 draft. Shannon practiced on the scout team with these Illini, mimicking Indiana guard Lamar Wilkerson, the Big Ten’s leading scorer in conference games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice, isn’t it, for all three to travel to campus during the NBA’s All-Star break?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And though perhaps they’d argue with this assessment, here’s what they saw: an Illini freshman duo that’s even better than Jakucionis and Riley were, and an Illini team — now 21-5 and in second place in the conference at 12-3 — with an even higher ceiling than the group Shannon carried to the Elite Eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/college-sports/2026/02/10/college-basketball-illinois-michigan-arizona-duke-cameron-boozer-keaton-wagler\"   &gt;Entering college basketball’s stretch run, here are 10 things to get you all caught up&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/college-sports/2026/02/09/illinois-hires-former-montana-coach-bobby-hauck-defensive-coordinator\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Illinois hires former Montana coach Bobby Hauck as defensive coordinator&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Smooth, lanky 6-6 point guard Keaton Wagler scored 18 points against the Hoosiers (17-9), easy work for a player averaging 21.5 — with 5.1 assists, 4.3 rebounds and 46% three-point shooting — in conference games. It’s no fluke Wagler is soaring toward the tops of mock drafts, widely projected as a top-10 kind of guy. And who doesn’t like a top-10 kind of guy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wagler had an unforgettable 46-point eruption in a win at Purdue, 28 in a major win at Nebraska, 34 last week in an overtime loss to Wisconsin. This time last year, point guard Jakucionis was hitting the freshman wall — he never would get himself un-hit after that — and the Illini started a fade-out that included three straight late-February losses, a blowout loss to Maryland in the Big Ten tournament, and an NCAA second-round bow-out against Kentucky in which Jakucionis and Riley combined for more turnovers (nine) than buckets (six). Wagler still looks fresh as a daisy, and the return of senior guard Kylan Boswell from a hand injury will only lighten Wagler’s load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with all the emphasis on Wagler, Sunday was freshman forward David Mrkovic’s time to shine brightest. The 6-9 Montenegrin — so burly, it’s as if Cole Kmet and Colston Loveland asked for a third, much taller buddy — dominated the game, scoring 25 and rebounding, dishing and splashing threes like the former European pro he is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He knows no one can guard him,” Boswell said. “He’s one of the best bigs in the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between them, Wagler and Mrkovic had zero turnovers, remarkable as much as each handles the ball. Wagler made like a fifth-year senior soon to be needing a real job when he dove into the Illini bench for a loose ball with a 16-point lead in the second half, a terrific look. Doesn’t he know he’s a lottery-bound freshman in the most me-first period in the history of college sports?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this Illini team also has explosive scorer Andrej Stojakovic coming back soon from an ankle injury, and Boswell back already. It has the 7-foot Ivisic twins, Tomislav the offensive standout and Zvonimir the shot eraser. It has the most efficient offense in the land, according to the metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CBS and analyst Clark Kellogg were in the building, conjuring thoughts of next month’s Big Dance. The Illini still have a 2 seed within reach — they came in at No. 5 in the country in the NET rankings, relied on heavily by the selection committee — but they’ll have to close hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t the first time Illinois beat Indiana on Feb. 15 to get to 21-5. It also happened in 2009; this is the Illini’s best start since then. That team ended up losing five of its last eight games, culminating in a first-round upset against Western Kentucky in the Big Dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no guarantees, as Illini fans understand well. Maybe too well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But right now, there’s reason for a great deal of hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tuw_l5C9phI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Indiana Hoosiers vs. No. 8 Illinois Fighting Illini | Full Game Highlights\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The Venezuelan catcher is set to miss at least a week and a half of time that would have been spent getting to know the Cubs pitching staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's not much you can do,” Counsell said Sunday, mentioning phone conversations as one of few ways the Cubs could try to help bridge the gap. “We’ve just got to play this process out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs had been more optimistic when spring training camp officially opened last Wednesday. And right-hander &lt;b&gt;Javier Assad&lt;/b&gt;, who was also delayed by visa issues, missed just the first day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s out of our control a little bit,” Counsell said Friday. “We're doing everything we can on our end. He's doing everything on his end.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Miller’s signing official&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs made&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/13/cubs-finalizing-multi-year-deal-with-reliever-shelby-miller-after-offseason-elbow-surgery\"   &gt; &lt;b&gt;Shelby Miller&lt;/b&gt;’s signing&lt;/a&gt; official on Sunday. He is joining the team on a two-year contract – worth $2.5 million, a source confirmed – with a club option for 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This year is very much in question, obviously, and it would be fast for this year,” Counsell said of Miller, who underwent offseason elbow surgery. “So this is about next year primarily. But you're open to see how the rehab goes and see what happens there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To clear room on the 40-man roster, the Cubs designated infielder &lt;b&gt;Ben Cowles&lt;/b&gt; for assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They opted not to put left-hander Justin Steele, who is targeting May or June for his return from season-ending elbow surgery last April, on the 60-day IL to open a spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He's doing really well,” general manager Carter Hawkins said last week of Steele’s rehab. “We want to make sure that we have full information for making decisions. I'm sure he's going to want to get back soon, and we want to honor that, and honor that competitiveness, and make sure that we're making good decisions on both ends.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building a foundation with Cabrera&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs don’t want to rush things with &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/01/16/why-cubs-saw-edward-cabrera-answer-long-quest-starting-pitching-jed-hoyer-tommy-hottovy\"   &gt;new starting pitcher &lt;b&gt;Edward Cabrera&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after acquiring him from the Marlins this offseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the challenge for Eddy is just, new team, really,” Counsell said. “And so we want to make sure we get that part of this right. I mean, 10 years and one place, with a lot of the same people … for the first time, you come to a new place, it's a hard thing to do. And there's a lot of new faces, and new ideas being thrown at you. So for [pitching coach &lt;b&gt;Tommy Hottovy&lt;/b&gt;] and I, we want to go slow here because of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cabrera threw in the pitching lab on Friday, and he tossed a bullpen session on Sunday. But the Cubs will be focusing on building a strong foundation with him over the coming weeks rather than pushing a quick ramp-up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Two years ago, he was the Opening Day Starter. Last year, he pitched in the Tokyo Series in mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The past four-ish springs, I've been in a different headspace,” Steele said in a conversation with the Sun-Times Sunday. “I've been preparing to get ready for the season, starting one of the first few games. So there's been definitely a mental switch as far as this one goes, because I'm not going to be leaving with the team.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building up after season-ending elbow surgery last April, he’s targeting May or June to return to a major-league mound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's a little comfortability knowing I don't have to be ready right away,” Steele said. “But it's also like, I want to be ready because I'm just so accustomed to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs’ rotation is built to weather his early-season absence. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/01/16/why-cubs-saw-edward-cabrera-answer-long-quest-starting-pitching-jed-hoyer-tommy-hottovy\"   &gt;Flame-throwing Edward Cabrera’s addition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/11/18/left-hander-shota-imanaga-accepts-qualifying-offer-to-return-to-cubs-in-2026\"   &gt;southpaw Shota Imanaga’s return on a one-year deal&lt;/a&gt;, and burgeoning young star &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/09/28/cubs-cade-horton-rib-injury-wild-card-playoffs-padres-nlds\"   &gt;Cade Horton’s injury recovery&lt;/a&gt; strengthened the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs also solidified their starting depth when right-hander Javier Assad returned to health late last season and the team re-signed Colin Rea in the offseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele, however, is set to provide a mid-season boost as the Cubs aim to push further into the postseason than their 2025 NL Division Series exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting him for healthy innings, and especially having him into October, is going to be the most important thing,” Cubs general manager Carter Hawkins said last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last October Steele, though unable to contribute on the field, joined the team for the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every pitch, everything just means a little bit more in playoffs,” Steele said of his takeaways. “Just seems like every moment has a little bit more weight to it. And I think that's how you've got to treat it, is, I can't just throw get-me-over strikes, every strike matters, they can change the score with one swing in the bat. So that's the energy you feel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele soaked in all that he could, as the Cubs went from the eclectic atmosphere at Wrigley Field – “That is something I want to pitch in,” Steele said – to the heartbreak in Milwaukee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obviously, I want to be playing,” he said. “But just being able to experience all that stuff definitely gave me insight into what it's going to be like when I do pitch in those situations. You still get the nervous feelings and whatnot, because you're somewhat still part of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it was back to the solitude of injury rehab .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Steele didn’t have to undergo full Tommy John surgery for the second time, shortening his expected recovery timeline by months. His elbow surgery last April stabilized his already reconstructed ulnar collateral ligament with an internal brace. As Steele explained it, the brace is supporting all the same “hardware” as before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As I started throwing again, it felt the same,” Steele said. “There was no difference — whereas the first Tommy John [surgery] I had, it felt like I had a new arm, I had to re-learn how to use it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele threw off a mound for the first time in mid-January, in an indoor facility during Cubs Convention. Now he’s built up to throwing 30-pitch bullpen sessions. As he progresses, he’ll gradually introduce new pitches, and as of Sunday, he’d integrated sliders into his last two bullpen sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Steele has built up the volume in his bullpens, he’ll advance to throwing live batting practice and eventually going on a minor-league rehab assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all goes to plan, he’ll return with plenty of time to make his mark on the regular season and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m excited about it,” Steele said. “Just want to get back as soon as possible, in a timely manner, and help the team win games.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
