He left Cubs camp to pitch for Mexico and proved what a difference-maker he could be in a multi-inning relief role. He allowed only two hits in 5⅔ scoreless innings in the course of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Big moments against great teams,’’ Mexico manager &lt;b&gt;Benji Gil&lt;/b&gt; said of Assad’s outings against the United States in pool play and Puerto Rico in the quarterfinals. ‘‘There’s a handful of guys in the world that have faced the lineups he just faced and dominated.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the talk about the WBC centers on the honor the players feel to represent their countries and on the challenges the schedule presents as teams gear up for the regular season. For many players, however, the big-game atmosphere has its developmental advantages, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘If you can get to the final rounds, those games are just so much fun that you get to re-create feelings that you have in October games,’’ Cubs manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell&lt;/b&gt; said. ‘‘And those are invaluable experiences.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WBC has more MLB star power this year than ever — quite literally. A record 78 MLB All-Stars, including 36 who got the nod last season, were featured on rosters as of Feb. 5. Thirteen players from the Cubs’ organization are set to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assad is one of them, and he’s expected to play an even larger role for Mexico in this tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Last time, it was a really great experience, really happy with it,’’ Assad said through an interpreter. ‘‘And I’ll go on to this one looking for new goals in the tournament.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Gil: ‘‘I’m just really looking forward to him pitching for us and then afterwards going and establishing himself as one of the better pitchers in the National League.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Outfield competition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs’ position-player group is largely set, but the competition for bench roles — and particularly a potential spot for a fourth outfielder — will be something to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matt Shaw&lt;/b&gt; has been taking fly balls in the outfield in preparation for a super-utility role and certainly will factor into the equation. Outside of the Cubs’ three regular starters — left fielder &lt;b&gt;Ian Happ&lt;/b&gt;, center fielder &lt;b&gt;Pete Crow-Armstrong&lt;/b&gt; and right fielder &lt;b&gt;Seiya Suzuki&lt;/b&gt; — the Cubs have five other outfielders in camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kevin Alcantara&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Justin Dean&lt;/b&gt;, whom the Cubs claimed off waivers this offseason, are on the 40-man roster. &lt;b&gt;Brett Bateman&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Dylan Carlson&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Chas McCormick&lt;/b&gt; are non-roster invitees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tyler Austin&lt;/b&gt; has played outfield in his career and likely will take fly balls as the Cubs make contingency plans, but Counsell said he sees Austin more as a first baseman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lefty options&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs’ bullpen featured three left-handers for stretches of last season, giving Counsell more options against left-handed-heavy lineups. They have five left-handed relievers in camp this year, including returnee &lt;b&gt;Caleb Thielbar&lt;/b&gt; and offseason additions &lt;b&gt;Hoby Milner&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Ryan Rolison&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

And they were rewarded with cookies, a heart-shaped box of chocolates, lollipops and s’mores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though participants admitted to the stress-relief benefits of the activity, no one was especially angry or broken-hearted. They were more interested in the opportunity to spend Valentine’s Day in a unique way and do their part to help the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don't do Valentine's Day, so this is great,” said Kathy Nagy, 62, of the South Loop, who attended with her husband, Michael. “It's a Hallmark holiday. You go out to dinner and get ushered out within 45 minutes because everybody has a waiting list. It's overpriced.

Clearing the invasive tree allows bottlebrush, wood reed grass and Joy Pyre weed to flourish in the soil and toads, frogs and salamanders to thrive in the pond. The volunteers made an impressive amount of headway toward this effort at Saturday’s event, which was marketed in a playful way to entice people to experience the natural areas in their communities, said Evelyn Alvarez, the coordinator of conservation action at Shedd Aquarium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's a really fun and engaging way to get people to learn about the harmful things in our environment, what they can do to make an impact for their local spaces, and also a really great way to connect with other people with similar interests,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antonio Marquez and Kayla Reum said throwing the trees on the fire was the best part of the day. The two teenagers attended with a group of friends. Reum dyed her hair pink for the occasion, and Marquez’s jeans with flaming pink hearts were chosen unintentionally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-5c0000\" name=\"image-5c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a0bef5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/94c9c38/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c43153/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Antonio Marquez (right) throws a piece of European buckthorn into a pile after cutting it on Valentine’s Day during Shedd Aquarium’s volunteer action days at LaGrange Park Woods in La Grange, Ill., Saturday, Feb. 14, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c43153/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18152b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c43153/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4675x2624+0+247/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd5%2F7f%2F391fa1a74632863c65523c5492e2%2Fvalentinerage-260215-20.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antonio Marquez (right) throws a piece of European buckthorn into a pile after cutting it on Valentine’s Day. “I’m just trying to do my part for the community,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m just trying to do my part for the community,” said Marquez, 19, of La Grange Park. “It’s nice to come out here and make a difference.

Last year, the cancer progressed to stage 4 and she began receiving chemotherapy treatments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day after she was released for the weekend from Lurie Children's Hospital to see family and friends in mid-October, her father, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/25/ruben-torres-maldonado-daughter-battling-cancer-judge-ruling\"   &gt;Ruben Torres Maldonado, was detained&lt;/a&gt; by ICE agents in Niles. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.suntimeswire.com/2025/10/25/ruben-torres-maldonado-daughter-battling-cancer-judge-ruling\"   &gt;Doctors said&lt;/a&gt; she was unable to continue treatment \"because of the stress and disruption\" caused by the arrest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following widespread demands for his release, including  &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reels/DP-PGMHjWQ-/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;a video made by Ofelia&lt;/a&gt; on social media, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/30/chicago-father-of-teen-battling-rare-cancer-ordered-released-from-ice-custody\"   &gt;Maldonado was released on bond&lt;/a&gt; from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention in late-October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Ofelia was heroic and brave in the face of ICE's detention and threatened deportation of her father,\" said Kalman Resnick, the attorney representing Torres, in a statement Saturday. \"We mourn Ofelia's passing, and we hope that she will serve as a model for us all for how to be courageous and to fight for what's right to our last breaths.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, an immigration judge in Chicago conditionally entitled her father to receive a \"cancellation of removal,\" due to the impact his deportation would have on his children who are citizens in the U.S. According to the news release, this would provide him with a pathway to lawful permanent residency and eventually U.S. citizenship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ofelia was able to watch her father's hearing via Zoom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-with-ofelia-support-her-family-now\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; page was started for Ofelia in October and has collected more than $119,000. &lt;/p&gt;",

We peck on the lips, hug and hold hands, but we have had only one real kiss so far. Rita was first married for 22 years to an emotionally abusive man and then remarried to a manipulative one. She said we were going too fast and she wanted to slow down. I understood and have exerted no pressure on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rita has canceled dates for various reasons and gone silent for a day here and there. She says she's not talking to anyone else, and neither am I. I have told her she is worth the wait. I have fallen hard for her and have serious intentions about her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rita says she has strong feelings for me and that I treat her better than any man she has ever been involved with, but she doesn't know how to handle the feelings. How long should I give her to figure out what she wants this relationship to be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not worried about sex or anything like that, but four months without even calling us \"dating\" or \"girlfriend and boyfriend\" has me worried that I am, for a lack of a better description, wasting my time with her. What would you advise me to do? — &lt;i&gt;TAKING IT SLOW IN VIRGINIA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR TAKING IT SLOW:&lt;/b&gt; Continue allowing your relationship with Rita to develop slowly. The woman has had two unsuccessful marriages, so it's no wonder she's slow to commit. If, after a year (eight months from now), Rita still feels uncomfortable calling you \"boyfriend\" or \"companion,\" revisit the conversation and decide then if you have invested enough time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; After reading so many horrible letters sent to you from people about their mothers-in-law, I feel compelled to write to you about mine. I met her 43 years ago when I was dating her oldest son (now my husband). From the moment we met, she treated me with caring, acceptance and love. She and my father-in-law raised five amazing children, and they treated their children's spouses as if we were their own. She devoted her entire life to caring for and nurturing her husband, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we just lost this beautiful woman at the age of 89 to a long and difficult battle with Parkinson's and dementia. We watched her \"sparkle\" slowly fade away, but we will carry her amazing legacy with us always. I hope I can be half the MIL to my children's spouses that she was to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also hope that all those who aren't as lucky as I was can find some common ground with their mothers-in-law — especially if there are children involved. I LOVE YOU, MOM! — &lt;i&gt;FORTUNATE IN NEW YORK&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR FORTUNATE:&lt;/b&gt; Thank you for sharing this beautiful tribute to a woman who made such a positive difference in the lives of those she touched. Not only were you fortunate to be a member of such a warm and loving family, but she was also lucky to have a daughter-in-law like you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

year&lt;/a&gt; to try to force the agency to lift the brick on the contracts, saying the company “has a clear legal right” to the ones on hold, with IDOT “legally required to award” them “to Builders Paving within 45 days of bid submission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no justification under the Illinois Procurement Code or applicable regulations for IDOT to withhold awarding the Contracts,” and Builders could suffer “irreparable injury” if there’s “an indeterminate, unexplained and unjustified delay in the award of millions of dollars in Contracts to Builders Paving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2026/01/09/cook-county-judge-sebastian-sam-palumbo-gandy-builders-paving-illinois-department-of-transportation\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;a Cook County judge ruled otherwise&lt;/a&gt;, writing: “The Court finds that the provisions highlighted by IDOT negate the existence of a ministerial obligation to award the contracts by providing that no bidder has a right to a State contract absent execution, that the State is under no obligation to issue an award, and that IDOT retains authority to reject any or all bids or cancel a solicitation in the State’s best interests.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Builders attorney William Dwyer Jr. told the Chicago Sun-Times that the company hasn’t filed an appeal, but has filed paperwork signaling the intent to do so “to preserve its right to appeal the judge’s ruling.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"

with IDOT by responding to any questions IDOT has and supplying any information requested. Builders has done so and will continue to do so in the hope that all issues can soon be resolved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither Builders nor IDOT would answer questions about whether a settlement is possible to resolve this dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Road construction season traditionally begins in April, which is also when local asphalt plants often start reopening, an IDOT spokeswoman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The start dates on the four projects Builders was the apparent low bidder on “are unknown until the contracts are executed,” she says. “However, presumably a late spring/early summer start.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brookfield’s village engineer, Derek Treichel of Hancock Engineering, says of his community’s resurfacing project: “We were hoping to start work in April.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right now we have no estimate” of a launch date, “we don’t even know if it’ll happen this year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides being an inconvenience, Treichel says “the risk of increased cost” associated with any delay “is a real concern.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said IDOT resisted the suggestion that — to get the Brookfield project rolling — the agency scrap the Builders bid and go with the next-best proposal, which was around $14,000 higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Niles municipal official says, “We have not received any information from IDOT regarding the anticipated construction schedule or any changes to the project.”&lt;/p&gt;",
