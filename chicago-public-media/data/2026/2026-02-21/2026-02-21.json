      "summary": "<img alt=\"Chicago White Sox's Munetaka Murakami, of Japan, watches the flight of his two-run double against the Chicago Cubs during the fourth inning of a spring training baseball game Friday, Feb. 20, 2026, in Mesa, Ariz.\" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7f1850f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3b%2F44%2F9da6cee7411cae1318e4867f8787%2Fmurakami.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;MESA, Ariz. — Munetaka Murakami is rarely seen in the White Sox clubhouse for an extended period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From one workout to another, he’s always on the move — except for on his ride to Sloan Park for Friday’s Cactus League opener against the Cubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami and numerous other Sox were stuck in traffic due to a crash on the interstate, nearly scratching the Japanese slugger from his first Spring Training start. He made it just in time, minutes before first pitch, and batted cleanup and started at first base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh my god!” Murakami said in English after the game when asked about running late, punching his fist animating a crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m really happy how it went without any injuries,” Murakami said through translator Kenzo Yagi. He was still in the car at 12:50 p.m. for the 1:05 p.m. start, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had butterflies inside me the first few minutes of it. But after I started fielding and I got an at-bat, I felt a bit more comfortable and felt myself,” Murakami said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All snafus aside, Murakami came inches away from a grand slam when his countryman Seiya Suzuki lost a fly ball in the sun and let it drop on the warning track. It turned into a two-run double.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a great at-bat. I was able to get good angles on the bat and velocity. I’m really happy how it went and how it went over my friend as well,” Murakami said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sox manager Will Venable commended Murakami’s ability to “collect himself” quickly and still be able to put together a 2-for-4 day with a two-run double, single and a strikeout in the Sox’ 8-1 win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about his first impression of Murakami so far in spring camp, new Sox hitting coach Derek Shomon used one word: “worker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[He] does not shy away from the work,” Shomon said. “Been very clear about wanting the information. [He] wants to utilize the resources that we have. I think more times than not it might be trying to pull him out of the cage and remind him to breathe, than to having to push him in the cage to actually get work done. The guy works really hard. It’s been fun to see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first base, Murakami knocked down a hard-hit groundball (112 mph exit velocity), corralled it and tossed to pitcher Jonathan Cannon for his first assist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying really hard to get adjusted to the field work,” Murakami, 26, said, adding that third baseman Miguel Vargas has provided some defensive tips so far in camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sox manager Will Venable said he’ll give the corner infielder some playing time at third base, especially ahead of the World Baseball Classic next month since he’ll likely see a bulk of time there for Team Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami said he plans to play in five Cactus League games before departing for the WBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox signed the 6-foot-2, 213 lb. right-hander to a two-year $12 million deal in December, making him one of the most distinguished international free-agent signings in franchise history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Japan, Murakami won back-to-back MVPs in 2021 and 2022. The latter year, at age 22, he set the Nippon Professional Baseball league record as the youngest triple crown winner and set the single-season home run record with 56 homers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami has been knocked for his high whiff rate, which he is well aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This guy’s smart, he really is. The aptitude is there. He has an understanding of likely what is going to be exposed and he’s doing a really good job attacking it on a daily basis and being really intentional with his work,” Shomon said.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "summary": "<p>Win or lose, Fremd — which went downstate the last two seasons and reached the Class 4A championship game a year ago — knew its game Friday would be its last on its home floor this season.</p><p>The Vikings didn’t get off to the start they wanted to, fouling too much and allowing too many easy baskets. But they increased the pressure in the second quarter, and senior guard Sophia McMillan was the catalyst.</p><p>‘‘She’s one of our magic puzzle pieces,’’ Fremd coach James Weaver said. ‘‘We can put her on a big [player], put her on a small.’’</p><p>McMillan raised the Vikings’ defensive intensity, suffocating Barrington’s ballhandlers and cutting off their every dribble. Her stifling defense forced the Broncos into multiple turnovers.</p><p>Fremd took control of the game after allowing only three points in the second quarter and coasted to a 60-30 victory in the title game of a Class 4A regional to advance to the sectional semifinals.</p><p>‘‘We started pressing them as a team and being connected on the floor, [which] really helped us with getting steals,’’ said McMillan, who scored seven of her 11 points in the second quarter.</p><p>Senior Greta Thompson was also a key to the Vikings’ lockdown quarter. She used great anticipation to come up with back-to-back steals that led to Fremd baskets.</p><p>‘‘That’s the one thing that we’ve been saying all playoffs: We have to play together,’’ said Thompson, who scored 13 points.</p><p>Junior guard Grace Todd joined McMillan with 11 points, and senior forward Isabella Del Mar added four points and six rebounds.</p><p>Creating havoc defensively enabled the Vikings’ transition offense to thrive. Barrington wasn’t ready for Fremd’s run-and-jump defensive tactics.</p><p>The Vikings don’t have one player who dominates the ball offensively. Instead, they run a motion offense predicated on driving and kicking the ball out to open teammates to create advantages.</p><p>Fremd’s doesn’t have the tallest players, either, but the Vikings are strong at covering for each other defensively and competing for rebounds. If a player gambles for a steal, teammates are ready to help until that player is back in position.</p><p>Fremd has nine seniors on its roster. They wanted to go out in style on their home floor.</p><p>‘‘[The game] was emotional because I care so much about this program,’’ Thompson said. ‘‘Going into this game, I felt like, ‘OK, we’ve gotta just leave everything we have because it’s our last time playing here.’ ’’</p><p>McMillan will be done playing basketball after this playoff run, so she’s soaking in every moment. She has committed to Illinois to play soccer.</p><p>‘‘It’s an amazing feeling as a senior,’’ McMillan said. ‘‘Each game is just so surreal. Going downstate is definitely our goal.’’</p><p>Kenwood, the defending Class 4A champion, was upset by Hinsdale Central in its regional championship game. If the Vikings can remain as connected defensively and play with as much energy as they did against the Broncos, then they’ll give themselves a chance against most teams.</p><p>Fremd will play Hersey in the sectional semifinals Tuesday at Schaumburg.</p><p>‘‘Survive and advance, right?’’ Weaver said.</p>",

JB Pritzker’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/springfield/2026/02/18/jb-pritzker-budget-proposal-state-of-state-social-media-tax\"   &gt;state budget proposal&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Pritzker said his budget limited discretionary spending to less than a 1 percent increase. The plan unveiled last week limits discretionary spending to less than a half a point increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An education funding lobby day was held the day before the budget address in Springfield. The teachers unions decried the state for not living up to its evidence-based funding law, which was supposed to bring all schools up to 90% “adequate” funding levels by next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the annual evidence-based funding ramp is way behind, and the unions say the state won’t reach its target until 2034. So, they claim, the state “owes” K-12 schools $5 billion and “owes” higher education another $1 billion. And, as they’ve been demanding for a while, they want it all now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-c00000\" name=\"module-c00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker’s budget proposal does increase spending on “mandated categoricals” for K-12 schools (things like special education, transportation and school lunches) by $51 million which, the governor’s office says, “benefit all districts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the governor’s plan will raise the annual evidence-based funding plan ramp payment increase by just $5 million, to $305 million. Higher education spending will be limited to a 1 percent increase, similar to last year, and way behind inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day before the governor delivered his proposed budget to lawmakers, rumors circulated among legislators that K-12 education would receive an additional $200 million. Some people assumed that money would be used to boost the state’s evidence-based funding law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor’s budget proposal did indeed project $200 million in revenues from imposing a new “social media platform fee,” and the money was earmarked for education. But, as I noted above, evidence-based funding was given only an additional $5 million on top of its (mostly) usual $300 million annual increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a PowerPoint presentation from the governor’s budget office, that $200 million, if approved and if the fee survives a legal challenge, would be “dedicated to supporting education.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My associate Isabel Miller asked Pritzker during his post-address news conference where that $200 million would go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Well, guess what? The Legislature has a lot to say about how the money would be spent, but I think the important thing is that our education system, our K-12 system across the state, needs that kind of support,” Pritzker said. Then he moved on before she could follow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But wait, this is Pritzker’s own budget proposal. And all the revenue from that new fee are included in his spending plan. The governor’s budget wouldn’t balance without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I followed up with the governor’s office to ask where, specifically, that money was going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The proposal is to deposit it into the Common School Fund — the same place the Lottery is deposited — to support the cost of K-12 education. The Common School Fund is one of the General Funds, so the deposit is reflected in the General Funds budget proposal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, but according to the governor’s budget book, the Common School Fund is expected to grow by $103 million in the coming fiscal year — roughly half of the $200 million it’s receiving. And the Lottery’s contribution to the fund is projected to grow by $17 million (to $832 million out of a $6.96 billion fund budget).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, this sort of thing used to happen with the Lottery all the time. The gambling cash didn’t really add new money to school funding, but it did help the state shift an equal amount away to the rest of the budget every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, $200 million is being added to the school fund, but, in the process, $114 million appears to have been shifted out of the fund to the rest of the budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker held a news conference Friday to tout his new proposal to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/02/21/chicago-students-share-mixed-feelings-on-pritzker-proposal-to-restrict-classroom-use-of-cellphones\"   &gt;ban cellphones&lt;/a&gt; in classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterward, the Illinois Federation of Teachers had seen enough and issued a sharply critical statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What educators will tell you is that creating more unfunded mandates while failing to fund the ones already on the books — special education, nutritional supports for hungry children and school transportation — is out of order,” said the federation's Executive Vice President Cyndi Oberle-Dahm via news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The state of Illinois owes its students $6 billion for pre-K to Ph.D., and that is where the governor should start.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rich Miller also publishes Capitol Fax, a daily political newsletter, and CapitolFax.com.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-5b0000\" name=\"module-5b0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Cubs manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell &lt;/b&gt;said he also plans to play Suzuki in center Sunday before he departs Monday for Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘You get a good view of the field [from center],’’ Suzuki said through an interpreter. ‘‘But can they do something about the sun? If they could move it just a little bit, that would be nice.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes, that age-old Arizona issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the top of the fourth, Murakami lifted a deep fly to straightaway center. Suzuki tracked it back to the warning track, sunglasses on and glove extended to shade his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ball, however, still disappeared in the glare, and Suzuki ducked as it landed behind him at the base of the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Seiya Suzuki loses a ball in the sun so his Japan World Baseball Classic teammate Munetaka Murakami gets a double &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/1LQ6LHVzgb\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1LQ6LHVzgb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talkin&amp;#39; Baseball (@TalkinBaseball_) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TalkinBaseball_/status/2024957358565175513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 20, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suzuki played the ricochet as Murakami trotted into second base with a two-run double, his second hit with the Sox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I loved him,’’ Suzuki said of his Team Japan teammate. ‘‘But after the [fly ball], I hate him, and I’m not going to support him.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting the laugh he was looking for, Suzuki grinned and clarified he was kidding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We’re in Chicago, same city,’’ Suzuki said. ‘‘He’s probably going to be there by himself. So if there’s anything that I can do to support him, I would be more than happy to.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bregman’s debut&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third baseman &lt;b&gt;Alex Bregman &lt;/b&gt;donned Cubbie blue pinstripes for his first spring-training game with the team. Bregman, who is set to represent the United States in the WBC, played three innings and went 0-for-2 at the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Super-cool to have all that energy in the ballpark,’’ Bregman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sloan Park’s announced attendance was 14,419, an impressive spring-training turnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Taillon gets the loss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taillon, pitching on a slightly early schedule as he prepares to join Team Canada for the WBC, allowed four runs in 1⅔ innings. He threw 34 pitches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We’ve been doing a lot of drill work and stuff, so I’m curious to show up tomorrow and to see what translated, what didn’t and what we can work on in between starts,’’ Taillon said. ‘‘Obviously, two homers on pitches down the middle. Besides that, everything felt fine.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those home runs came on a first-pitch fastball to Sox outfielder &lt;b&gt;Austin Hays &lt;/b&gt;and on an 0-2 fastball to

You kind of got this well-rounded thing in place. That’s exciting, right? So, you have multiple solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox displayed much offense in early-game action Friday in their 8-1 win over the Cubs in the Cactus League opener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's exciting,” Sox manager &lt;b&gt;Will Venable&lt;/b&gt; said, noting a strong day from several newcomers, including a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2026/02/20/munetaka-murakami-fashionably-late-impresses-in-cactus-league-debut\"   &gt;double from &lt;b&gt;Munetaka Murakami&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and home runs from &lt;b&gt;Austin Hays&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Sam Antonacci&lt;/b&gt;. “We're excited to be able to add those guys to our offense and to come out the first day and put a couple nice swings on the ball was great and those guys are going to be in the middle of our lineup all year, so it's exciting to see.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The first White Sox home run of Spring Training belongs to Austin Hays! &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/38WVCfaSyy\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/38WVCfaSyy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/whitesox/status/2024940356111139124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 20, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox are hoping the additions of Murakami, Hays, plus utilityman &lt;b&gt;Luisangel Acuña&lt;/b&gt;, who did not play Friday, can help boost the offensive this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also is relying on four second-year players to build on relative success last season — shortstop &lt;b&gt;Colson Montgomery&lt;/b&gt;, second baseman &lt;b&gt;Chase Meidroth&lt;/b&gt; and catchers &lt;b&gt;Kyle Teel&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Edgar Quero&lt;/b&gt;.

That was just kind of the point of improvement going forward, could definitely be more in the zone a little bit more. But overall, I thought it was good, a lot to build off of, long spring ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pereira late scratch from lineup&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outfielder &lt;b&gt;Everson Pereira&lt;/b&gt; was scratched from Friday’s lineup for precautionary reasons due to general soreness, Venable said. He’s listed as day to day, then “we’ll see where he’s at,” Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 24-year-old former top 100 prospect has impressed Venable early in spring training with his power potential, but his ability to make contact has fallen behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pereira said earlier this week that it’s “probably impossible” for him to sacrifice some power in exchange to becoming a better contact hitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I think if you are able to make contact with the ball and you are strong enough, the ball is going to carry itself,” Pereira said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sox 8, Cubs 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Hays homered on the first pitch he saw, launching a down-the-middle fastball to the left-center lawn. Antonacci, a Springfield product and a top prospect in the Sox' system, also homered in his first at-bat.

Edwin Moreno, 27, was arrested on suspicion of possessing machine gun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barraza, a resident of Chicago, illegally sold a loaded handgun to an undercover law enforcement officer for $2,000 and 127 grams of cocaine for $3,600 at a Bolingbrook gas station on Feb. 5, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The handgun was equipped with a machine gun conversion device and an extended magazine containing 19 rounds of ammunition, the complaint said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreno, also a resident of Chicago, was in possession of a firearm equipped with a machine gun conversion device Jan. 15 when undercover law enforcement officers disguised as tow operators conducted a vehicle repossession in Joliet, the complaint said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barraza and Moreno will appear before U.S. Magistrate Judge Laura K.
