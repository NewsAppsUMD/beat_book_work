      "summary": "<img alt=\"Chicago White Sox's Munetaka Murakami, of Japan, watches the flight of his two-run double against the Chicago Cubs during the fourth inning of a spring training baseball game Friday, Feb. 20, 2026, in Mesa, Ariz.\" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7f1850f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3b%2F44%2F9da6cee7411cae1318e4867f8787%2Fmurakami.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;MESA, Ariz. — Munetaka Murakami is rarely seen in the White Sox clubhouse for an extended period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From one workout to another, he’s always on the move — except for on his ride to Sloan Park for Friday’s Cactus League opener against the Cubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami and numerous other Sox were stuck in traffic due to a crash on the interstate, nearly scratching the Japanese slugger from his first Spring Training start. He made it just in time, minutes before first pitch, and batted cleanup and started at first base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh my god!” Murakami said in English after the game when asked about running late, punching his fist animating a crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m really happy how it went without any injuries,” Murakami said through translator Kenzo Yagi. He was still in the car at 12:50 p.m. for the 1:05 p.m. start, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had butterflies inside me the first few minutes of it. But after I started fielding and I got an at-bat, I felt a bit more comfortable and felt myself,” Murakami said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All snafus aside, Murakami came inches away from a grand slam when his countryman Seiya Suzuki lost a fly ball in the sun and let it drop on the warning track. It turned into a two-run double.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a great at-bat. I was able to get good angles on the bat and velocity. I’m really happy how it went and how it went over my friend as well,” Murakami said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sox manager Will Venable commended Murakami’s ability to “collect himself” quickly and still be able to put together a 2-for-4 day with a two-run double, single and a strikeout in the Sox’ 8-1 win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about his first impression of Murakami so far in spring camp, new Sox hitting coach Derek Shomon used one word: “worker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[He] does not shy away from the work,” Shomon said. “Been very clear about wanting the information. [He] wants to utilize the resources that we have. I think more times than not it might be trying to pull him out of the cage and remind him to breathe, than to having to push him in the cage to actually get work done. The guy works really hard. It’s been fun to see.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first base, Murakami knocked down a hard-hit groundball (112 mph exit velocity), corralled it and tossed to pitcher Jonathan Cannon for his first assist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying really hard to get adjusted to the field work,” Murakami, 26, said, adding that third baseman Miguel Vargas has provided some defensive tips so far in camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sox manager Will Venable said he’ll give the corner infielder some playing time at third base, especially ahead of the World Baseball Classic next month since he’ll likely see a bulk of time there for Team Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami said he plans to play in five Cactus League games before departing for the WBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox signed the 6-foot-2, 213 lb. right-hander to a two-year $12 million deal in December, making him one of the most distinguished international free-agent signings in franchise history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Japan, Murakami won back-to-back MVPs in 2021 and 2022. The latter year, at age 22, he set the Nippon Professional Baseball league record as the youngest triple crown winner and set the single-season home run record with 56 homers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami has been knocked for his high whiff rate, which he is well aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This guy’s smart, he really is. The aptitude is there. He has an understanding of likely what is going to be exposed and he’s doing a really good job attacking it on a daily basis and being really intentional with his work,” Shomon said.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "summary": "<p>Win or lose, Fremd — which went downstate the last two seasons and reached the Class 4A championship game a year ago — knew its game Friday would be its last on its home floor this season.</p><p>The Vikings didn’t get off to the start they wanted to, fouling too much and allowing too many easy baskets. But they increased the pressure in the second quarter, and senior guard Sophia McMillan was the catalyst.</p><p>‘‘She’s one of our magic puzzle pieces,’’ Fremd coach James Weaver said. ‘‘We can put her on a big [player], put her on a small.’’</p><p>McMillan raised the Vikings’ defensive intensity, suffocating Barrington’s ballhandlers and cutting off their every dribble. Her stifling defense forced the Broncos into multiple turnovers.</p><p>Fremd took control of the game after allowing only three points in the second quarter and coasted to a 60-30 victory in the title game of a Class 4A regional to advance to the sectional semifinals.</p><p>‘‘We started pressing them as a team and being connected on the floor, [which] really helped us with getting steals,’’ said McMillan, who scored seven of her 11 points in the second quarter.</p><p>Senior Greta Thompson was also a key to the Vikings’ lockdown quarter. She used great anticipation to come up with back-to-back steals that led to Fremd baskets.</p><p>‘‘That’s the one thing that we’ve been saying all playoffs: We have to play together,’’ said Thompson, who scored 13 points.</p><p>Junior guard Grace Todd joined McMillan with 11 points, and senior forward Isabella Del Mar added four points and six rebounds.</p><p>Creating havoc defensively enabled the Vikings’ transition offense to thrive. Barrington wasn’t ready for Fremd’s run-and-jump defensive tactics.</p><p>The Vikings don’t have one player who dominates the ball offensively. Instead, they run a motion offense predicated on driving and kicking the ball out to open teammates to create advantages.</p><p>Fremd’s doesn’t have the tallest players, either, but the Vikings are strong at covering for each other defensively and competing for rebounds. If a player gambles for a steal, teammates are ready to help until that player is back in position.</p><p>Fremd has nine seniors on its roster. They wanted to go out in style on their home floor.</p><p>‘‘[The game] was emotional because I care so much about this program,’’ Thompson said. ‘‘Going into this game, I felt like, ‘OK, we’ve gotta just leave everything we have because it’s our last time playing here.’ ’’</p><p>McMillan will be done playing basketball after this playoff run, so she’s soaking in every moment. She has committed to Illinois to play soccer.</p><p>‘‘It’s an amazing feeling as a senior,’’ McMillan said. ‘‘Each game is just so surreal. Going downstate is definitely our goal.’’</p><p>Kenwood, the defending Class 4A champion, was upset by Hinsdale Central in its regional championship game. If the Vikings can remain as connected defensively and play with as much energy as they did against the Broncos, then they’ll give themselves a chance against most teams.</p><p>Fremd will play Hersey in the sectional semifinals Tuesday at Schaumburg.</p><p>‘‘Survive and advance, right?’’ Weaver said.</p>",

JB Pritzker’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/springfield/2026/02/18/jb-pritzker-budget-proposal-state-of-state-social-media-tax\"   &gt;state budget proposal&lt;/a&gt; last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Pritzker said his budget limited discretionary spending to less than a 1 percent increase. The plan unveiled last week limits discretionary spending to less than a half a point increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An education funding lobby day was held the day before the budget address in Springfield. The teachers unions decried the state for not living up to its evidence-based funding law, which was supposed to bring all schools up to 90% “adequate” funding levels by next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the annual evidence-based funding ramp is way behind, and the unions say the state won’t reach its target until 2034. So, they claim, the state “owes” K-12 schools $5 billion and “owes” higher education another $1 billion. And, as they’ve been demanding for a while, they want it all now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-c00000\" name=\"module-c00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker’s budget proposal does increase spending on “mandated categoricals” for K-12 schools (things like special education, transportation and school lunches) by $51 million which, the governor’s office says, “benefit all districts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the governor’s plan will raise the annual evidence-based funding plan ramp payment increase by just $5 million, to $305 million. Higher education spending will be limited to a 1 percent increase, similar to last year, and way behind inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day before the governor delivered his proposed budget to lawmakers, rumors circulated among legislators that K-12 education would receive an additional $200 million. Some people assumed that money would be used to boost the state’s evidence-based funding law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor’s budget proposal did indeed project $200 million in revenues from imposing a new “social media platform fee,” and the money was earmarked for education. But, as I noted above, evidence-based funding was given only an additional $5 million on top of its (mostly) usual $300 million annual increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a PowerPoint presentation from the governor’s budget office, that $200 million, if approved and if the fee survives a legal challenge, would be “dedicated to supporting education.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My associate Isabel Miller asked Pritzker during his post-address news conference where that $200 million would go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Well, guess what? The Legislature has a lot to say about how the money would be spent, but I think the important thing is that our education system, our K-12 system across the state, needs that kind of support,” Pritzker said. Then he moved on before she could follow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But wait, this is Pritzker’s own budget proposal. And all the revenue from that new fee are included in his spending plan. The governor’s budget wouldn’t balance without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I followed up with the governor’s office to ask where, specifically, that money was going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The proposal is to deposit it into the Common School Fund — the same place the Lottery is deposited — to support the cost of K-12 education. The Common School Fund is one of the General Funds, so the deposit is reflected in the General Funds budget proposal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, but according to the governor’s budget book, the Common School Fund is expected to grow by $103 million in the coming fiscal year — roughly half of the $200 million it’s receiving. And the Lottery’s contribution to the fund is projected to grow by $17 million (to $832 million out of a $6.96 billion fund budget).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, this sort of thing used to happen with the Lottery all the time. The gambling cash didn’t really add new money to school funding, but it did help the state shift an equal amount away to the rest of the budget every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, $200 million is being added to the school fund, but, in the process, $114 million appears to have been shifted out of the fund to the rest of the budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker held a news conference Friday to tout his new proposal to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/02/21/chicago-students-share-mixed-feelings-on-pritzker-proposal-to-restrict-classroom-use-of-cellphones\"   &gt;ban cellphones&lt;/a&gt; in classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterward, the Illinois Federation of Teachers had seen enough and issued a sharply critical statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What educators will tell you is that creating more unfunded mandates while failing to fund the ones already on the books — special education, nutritional supports for hungry children and school transportation — is out of order,” said the federation's Executive Vice President Cyndi Oberle-Dahm via news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The state of Illinois owes its students $6 billion for pre-K to Ph.D., and that is where the governor should start.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rich Miller also publishes Capitol Fax, a daily political newsletter, and CapitolFax.com.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-5b0000\" name=\"module-5b0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Cubs manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell &lt;/b&gt;said he also plans to play Suzuki in center Sunday before he departs Monday for Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘You get a good view of the field [from center],’’ Suzuki said through an interpreter. ‘‘But can they do something about the sun? If they could move it just a little bit, that would be nice.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah, yes, that age-old Arizona issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the top of the fourth, Murakami lifted a deep fly to straightaway center. Suzuki tracked it back to the warning track, sunglasses on and glove extended to shade his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ball, however, still disappeared in the glare, and Suzuki ducked as it landed behind him at the base of the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Seiya Suzuki loses a ball in the sun so his Japan World Baseball Classic teammate Munetaka Murakami gets a double &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/1LQ6LHVzgb\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1LQ6LHVzgb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Talkin&amp;#39; Baseball (@TalkinBaseball_) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/TalkinBaseball_/status/2024957358565175513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 20, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suzuki played the ricochet as Murakami trotted into second base with a two-run double, his second hit with the Sox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I loved him,’’ Suzuki said of his Team Japan teammate. ‘‘But after the [fly ball], I hate him, and I’m not going to support him.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting the laugh he was looking for, Suzuki grinned and clarified he was kidding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We’re in Chicago, same city,’’ Suzuki said. ‘‘He’s probably going to be there by himself. So if there’s anything that I can do to support him, I would be more than happy to.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bregman’s debut&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third baseman &lt;b&gt;Alex Bregman &lt;/b&gt;donned Cubbie blue pinstripes for his first spring-training game with the team. Bregman, who is set to represent the United States in the WBC, played three innings and went 0-for-2 at the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Super-cool to have all that energy in the ballpark,’’ Bregman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sloan Park’s announced attendance was 14,419, an impressive spring-training turnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Taillon gets the loss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taillon, pitching on a slightly early schedule as he prepares to join Team Canada for the WBC, allowed four runs in 1⅔ innings. He threw 34 pitches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We’ve been doing a lot of drill work and stuff, so I’m curious to show up tomorrow and to see what translated, what didn’t and what we can work on in between starts,’’ Taillon said. ‘‘Obviously, two homers on pitches down the middle. Besides that, everything felt fine.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those home runs came on a first-pitch fastball to Sox outfielder &lt;b&gt;Austin Hays &lt;/b&gt;and on an 0-2 fastball to

You kind of got this well-rounded thing in place. That’s exciting, right? So, you have multiple solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox displayed much offense in early-game action Friday in their 8-1 win over the Cubs in the Cactus League opener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's exciting,” Sox manager &lt;b&gt;Will Venable&lt;/b&gt; said, noting a strong day from several newcomers, including a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2026/02/20/munetaka-murakami-fashionably-late-impresses-in-cactus-league-debut\"   &gt;double from &lt;b&gt;Munetaka Murakami&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/a&gt;and home runs from &lt;b&gt;Austin Hays&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Sam Antonacci&lt;/b&gt;. “We're excited to be able to add those guys to our offense and to come out the first day and put a couple nice swings on the ball was great and those guys are going to be in the middle of our lineup all year, so it's exciting to see.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The first White Sox home run of Spring Training belongs to Austin Hays! &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/38WVCfaSyy\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/38WVCfaSyy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/whitesox/status/2024940356111139124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 20, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox are hoping the additions of Murakami, Hays, plus utilityman &lt;b&gt;Luisangel Acuña&lt;/b&gt;, who did not play Friday, can help boost the offensive this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also is relying on four second-year players to build on relative success last season — shortstop &lt;b&gt;Colson Montgomery&lt;/b&gt;, second baseman &lt;b&gt;Chase Meidroth&lt;/b&gt; and catchers &lt;b&gt;Kyle Teel&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Edgar Quero&lt;/b&gt;.

That was just kind of the point of improvement going forward, could definitely be more in the zone a little bit more. But overall, I thought it was good, a lot to build off of, long spring ahead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pereira late scratch from lineup&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outfielder &lt;b&gt;Everson Pereira&lt;/b&gt; was scratched from Friday’s lineup for precautionary reasons due to general soreness, Venable said. He’s listed as day to day, then “we’ll see where he’s at,” Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 24-year-old former top 100 prospect has impressed Venable early in spring training with his power potential, but his ability to make contact has fallen behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pereira said earlier this week that it’s “probably impossible” for him to sacrifice some power in exchange to becoming a better contact hitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I think if you are able to make contact with the ball and you are strong enough, the ball is going to carry itself,” Pereira said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sox 8, Cubs 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Hays homered on the first pitch he saw, launching a down-the-middle fastball to the left-center lawn. Antonacci, a Springfield product and a top prospect in the Sox' system, also homered in his first at-bat.

Edwin Moreno, 27, was arrested on suspicion of possessing machine gun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barraza, a resident of Chicago, illegally sold a loaded handgun to an undercover law enforcement officer for $2,000 and 127 grams of cocaine for $3,600 at a Bolingbrook gas station on Feb. 5, according to a criminal complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The handgun was equipped with a machine gun conversion device and an extended magazine containing 19 rounds of ammunition, the complaint said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreno, also a resident of Chicago, was in possession of a firearm equipped with a machine gun conversion device Jan. 15 when undercover law enforcement officers disguised as tow operators conducted a vehicle repossession in Joliet, the complaint said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barraza and Moreno will appear before U.S. Magistrate Judge Laura K.

This means you must take care of yourself so you can be a resource that others can depend on for guidance, comfort, and courage. Time for a makeover?&lt;/p&gt;",

He loves the program and trusts Mike.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justin Oliver led the Condors (26-1) with 15 points and seven assists. He stepped up huge in the fourth quarter with eight points and multiple assists as Curie turned a three-point advantage into a double-digit lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They told me they needed me, so I got in the paint and made some passes,” Oliver said. [Kendall Holliday and Keith Collins] were the x-factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holliday, a 6-4 senior and Collins, a 6-8 senior, dominated in the post as the Condors out-rebounded Lincoln Park 33-19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holliday finished with 13 points and 11 rebounds and Collins added 11 points and eight rebounds off the bench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We just need Collins to be big and cause havoc,” Mike Oliver said. “Any points he gives us is a bonus.

That’s where we came up short last year, we had no one to rebound and play good defense in the paint.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Oliver’s son, Mike Oliver Jr., scored three points and had three assists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This one is real special because these are the guys [my son] came in with and their goal was to sophomore champs and city champs [and they accomplished it,” Mike Oliver said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-1a0000\" name=\"image-1a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7f28ecb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdd%2Fb7%2F068fa6524b76aab3ab56b503ffa4%2Fob-cst-022126-7003.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2f765e5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdd%2Fb7%2F068fa6524b76aab3ab56b503ffa4%2Fob-cst-022126-7003.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e792832/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdd%2Fb7%2F068fa6524b76aab3ab56b503ffa4%2Fob-cst-022126-7003.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Curie celebrates its Public League championship victory over Lincoln Park.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e792832/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdd%2Fb7%2F068fa6524b76aab3ab56b503ffa4%2Fob-cst-022126-7003.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/23fea79/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdd%2Fb7%2F068fa6524b76aab3ab56b503ffa4%2Fob-cst-022126-7003.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e792832/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdd%2Fb7%2F068fa6524b76aab3ab56b503ffa4%2Fob-cst-022126-7003.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curie celebrates its Public League championship victory over Lincoln Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curie led 22-18 after a fun, fast first quarter. The rest of the game was a physical, foul-filled slog. Lincoln Park starters Ahmad Lee (nine points) and Larry Harris (eight points, six rebounds) fouled out late in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This feels amazing,” Holliday said. “It doesn’t feel great it feels tremendous. Just excellent. I worked hard for it. Even though this goal is done we still have the state championship goal and we have to work even harder for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curie’s only loss this season was to top-ranked DePaul Prep at the Pontiac Holiday Tournament. The emergence of Collins will be a significant factor in the Condors’ state playoff run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We worked so hard for this moment,” Justin Oliver said. “To beat a team playing their best basketball feels great. I’m ready to go win state now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior guard Jaylen Dickerson led Lincoln Park (20-8) with 17 points and sophomore Alvin Robinson scored 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the first city title game appearance for Lincoln Park in 122 years. The school was called North Division when it knocked off Austin to win the championship in 1904. It was renamed Waller and then became Lincoln Park in the late 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m proud of these guys,” Lions coach Josh Anderson said. “They made a run and started playing good basketball at the right time. We didn’t finish the goal but we got where we wanted to be and our young guys were able to get a taste of the atmosphere. That is great for the program.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n

Jesse Jackson arrived in Chicago in 1964, he came face to face with a segregated school system where Black and Latino students attempted to learn in schools so overcrowded that hallways became classrooms and supplies were scarce. He quickly jumped into the fight to end disparities in education — a cause he’d champion throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early on, he helped organize protests against the poor learning conditions. Later he founded PUSH Excel, a program backed by former President Jimmy Carter’s administration that supported Black students by encouraging better study habits and offering mentorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He often used his national standing to bring attention to issues affecting students. Like in 1999, when he led marches through the streets of Decatur, Ill. in defense of seven Black teens expelled from school for two years for a fight, shining a light on the unequal effects of harsh discipline policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson marched and picketed with the Chicago Teachers Union, joining their struggle for better working conditions for teachers and more resources for schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently he used his voice to address a range of higher education issues in Chicago, including speaking out in support of pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Gadlin, a former communications director for Jackson and the CTU, said his poor upbringing in segregated South Carolina motivated his work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wasn't afforded many opportunities and was told he was a “nobody,” she said. That's why when Jackson visited classrooms he made sure kids knew they were “somebody.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It wasn't just fighting for public policy,” Gadlin said, “it was also lifting up young minds and ensuring that they knew they could achieve under any kind of circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fighting ‘Willis Wagons’ and pushing school integration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jackson arrived in Chicago in 1964 with his wife and young family, he joined a fight already underway for better conditions in Chicago schools and communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly before he arrived, for example, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/reset-with-sasha-ann-simons/2024/05/06/how-the-1963-cps-boycott-over-segregation-shaped-chicago-protests-for-decades-to-come\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;more than 200,000 students participated in a school boycott&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to protest the mobile classrooms that Chicago Public Schools put in the parking lots of majority Black schools on the South and West sides to relieve overcrowding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-2a0000\" name=\"image-2a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/19e27e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2872x1612+0+334/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F40%2Fd8%2F31152e0047bc8c3fc30180ce7075%2Fimg1070a-841.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a785a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2872x1612+0+334/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F40%2Fd8%2F31152e0047bc8c3fc30180ce7075%2Fimg1070a-841.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1975135/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2872x1612+0+334/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F40%2Fd8%2F31152e0047bc8c3fc30180ce7075%2Fimg1070a-841.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Students stand outside mobile classrooms and hold protest signs.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1975135/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2872x1612+0+334/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F40%2Fd8%2F31152e0047bc8c3fc30180ce7075%2Fimg1070a-841.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5879853/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2872x1612+0+334/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F40%2Fd8%2F31152e0047bc8c3fc30180ce7075%2Fimg1070a-841.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1975135/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2872x1612+0+334/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F40%2Fd8%2F31152e0047bc8c3fc30180ce7075%2Fimg1070a-841.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago students protest the use of portable classrooms in 1963.

James Thompson, to ensure the safety of students during the transition, according to reporting at the time in the Chicago Daily News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the first day of school in 1977, Jackson urged discipline and peace. Then he embraced seven Black children headed to a bus stop to travel to their new school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some buses were met with jeers and lines of angry adults. Jackson escorted Black students into an Ashburn elementary school, where someone had spray painted “Resist Busing” on the sidewalk. A white protester spat on Jackson and shouted obscenities at him before getting arrested, according to the Chicago Daily News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Jackson’s programs supported Black students, but some critiqued his approach&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1975 Jackson founded PUSH Excel, the educational arm of his Rainbow PUSH organization, to support Black students in school and help them find jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He urged personal accountability, advising students to lead a disciplined life. At the time, the New York Times reported, he said Black schools were “chaotic” with rampant drug use and out-of-control students. Jackson also challenged parents to be more involved in their children’s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/08/archives/jesse-jackson-begins-a-model-program-in-chicago-to-improve-the.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Some critics felt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Jackson placed too much blame on the victims of racism.

It also helps students visit historically Black colleges and universities, and in recent years has offered summer camps focused on teaching students to code and resolve conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Jackson brought national attention to the expulsion of Black students&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1999, Jackson jumped in the fray when seven Black teens in Decatur were expelled for two years after a brawl at a football game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His involvement brought a national focus on the teens’ plight and the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2011/07/14/cps-students-demand-new-discipline-policies-meeting-with-school-board\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;debate over “zero tolerance” policies at schools&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which imposed severe consequences for specific offenses, regardless of context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson argued that the teens understood what they did was wrong and needed correction, but keeping them from school for so long would only harm their education. He also said such policies disproportionately punish Black students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson led protests and vigils for the students. One march through Decatur drew thousands. He also faced detractors: Members of the Ku Klux Klan hounded the group and held their own gatherings while Jackson was there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gadlin, who was with Jackson in Decatur, remembers feeling afraid the white supremacist group would respond with violence to their protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gadlin recalls Jackson’s measured response was: “You cannot show fear, you never show fear, God is on our side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d80000\" name=\"image-d80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f08c216/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1992x1118+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Ff9%2F499f67eb4f38959e163b30288efe%2Fexpelled-students-1.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/238e7d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1992x1118+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Ff9%2F499f67eb4f38959e163b30288efe%2Fexpelled-students-1.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2eb2564/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1992x1118+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Ff9%2F499f67eb4f38959e163b30288efe%2Fexpelled-students-1.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Jesse Jackson prays with expelled Decatur students\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2eb2564/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1992x1118+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Ff9%2F499f67eb4f38959e163b30288efe%2Fexpelled-students-1.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fdda38d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1992x1118+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Ff9%2F499f67eb4f38959e163b30288efe%2Fexpelled-students-1.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2eb2564/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1992x1118+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Ff9%2F499f67eb4f38959e163b30288efe%2Fexpelled-students-1.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 1999, the Rev.

As a result of those efforts, the students got just one year of expulsion, with the chance to enroll in alternative schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Jackson wanted them reinstated earlier if they achieved academically. When school officials wouldn’t budge, Jackson led a demonstration outside one of the schools. Jackson was arrested after trying to lead a group into the building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ordeal caught the attention of Gov. George Ryan, who after speaking with Jackson expressed support for his efforts to reform zero-tolerance policies and limit school expulsions, according to the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson was ahead of his time. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/news/2014/06/24/cps-softens-strict-discipline-policies\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Chicago moved away from zero-tolerance policies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2015 &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://will.illinois.edu/news/story/illinois-issues-new-school-discipline-philosophy-one-year-later\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;the state legislature passed a law&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; putting strict limits on suspensions and expulsions at Illinois schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Jackson lifted up fight to reopen Dyett High School&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Jackson’s most prominent stances came in 2015 when he joined community members in their fight to save Dyett High School from closure, including &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2015/8/19/18612221/rev-jesse-jackson-joins-parents-in-hunger-strike-over-new-dyett-school\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;participating in a hunger strike&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that saved the South Side school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that, parents and activists had spent years protesting the district’s plan to phase out the school, citing its low enrollment and poor academic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago School Board member Jitu Brown, one of the community organizers at the time, said Jackson was instrumental in getting the hunger strike off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e40000\" name=\"image-e40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aacb582/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fde%2Fcf4667c14cd5b8454828945e87c0%2Fdyett-999x665.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c619280/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fde%2Fcf4667c14cd5b8454828945e87c0%2Fdyett-999x665.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1a86896/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+54/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fde%2Fcf4667c14cd5b8454828945e87c0%2Fdyett-999x665.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The Rev.

Some of the protestors were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson, who was 73 at the time, fasted for three days in solidarity, Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By Rev. Jackson putting his weight behind the hunger strike, it let the powers that be know that we had some heavyweight support,” Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strike eventually put pressure on CPS to reopen the building in 2016 as Dyett High School for the Arts.

Jackson said he met with both parties at the hotel, shuttling across the hallway that separated them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As I said to both sides, if it means meeting all night long, let’s meet all night long,” Jackson said at the time, according to the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Jackson marched through the Loop alongside former CTU President Karen Lewis to protest the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/chicagos-50-closed-schools\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;mass closures of 50 schools&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-8b0000\" name=\"image-8b0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f1f51b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+97/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F38%2F39%2Fcef5a0c74ed09ed075df2bf2bad8%2Fctu-cst-032813-4.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9069b39/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+97/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F38%2F39%2Fcef5a0c74ed09ed075df2bf2bad8%2Fctu-cst-032813-4.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f382e01/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x575+0+97/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F38%2F39%2Fcef5a0c74ed09ed075df2bf2bad8%2Fctu-cst-032813-4.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The Rev.

On the day it ran, pro-Palestinian demonstrators were in their fifth day of staging an encampment in the university’s quad, and the university officials were &lt;a class=\"Link\"

The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the expanded deduction would reduce tax collections by $200 million through 2034.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill also permanently removes the ability for filers, like teachers, to deduct so-called “miscellaneous expenses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 2025 tax year, eligible educators — teachers, counselors, classroom aides, principals and other K-12 instructors at a state-recognized school — with at least 900 hours of annual employment are allowed to claim up to $300 \"above-the-line,\" or $600 for joint filers, if each spouse qualifies. An above-the-line deduction reduces your adjusted gross income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qualified expenses include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-eec1ec32-fae0-11f0-a41a-b925e60fa400\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Books and other learning materials, except athletic supplies for health and physical education classes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Classroom supplies such as paper and art supplies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Computers, software and related accessories&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Instructional equipment and supplementary materials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Professional development courses tied directly to teaching&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois teachers can also benefit from the state's K-12 Instructional Materials and Supplies credit that provides a $500 tax credit per educator, according to Elizabeth Buffardi, founder of Crescendo Financial Planners in Oak Brook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eligible expenses are similar to those under the federal educator expense deduction, such as school supplies and equipment. The state credit is available to K-12 teachers, instructors, counselors, principals or aides in a qualified school, working at least 900 hours during the school year, according to the Illinois Department of Revenue. The maximum credit is $1,000 for married couples filing jointly, who are both eligible educators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While these credits are helpful, most teachers spend more than this for their classrooms,” Buffardi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Changes for 2026&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 2026 tax year, the bill's definition of eligible educator will include coaches and interscholastic sports administrators. It also broadens eligible items from \"in the classroom\" to \"as part of instructional activity,\" according to the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And an educator's deduction increases from $300 to $350, or $700 for married couples, if both are eligible educators, according to Buffardi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, itemized deductions will be allowed for qualifying classroom expenses without a dollar limit. Taxpayers should be aware of a key caveat under the new rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you don’t itemize, you get no [extra] deduction at all,” Mark Gallegos, tax partner at Porte Brown, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a teacher who spent $1,400 in qualifying expenses this year could take the $350 deduction, which lowers their adjusted gross income, and because they itemized, they can deduct the remaining $1,050 on their Schedule A. Previously, only $300 would have been deductible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you haven't been able to itemize for the past several years, you’ll want to look to see if you’ll be able to itemize in 2026,” Buffardi said. “With the changes to the itemizing rules, more people may be able to itemize than in the past several years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy shift should prompt teachers to reassess their tax planning strategies, Florida attorney David Weisselberger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many educators will be forced to weigh the benefits of the simplicity of the cap on the new deduction against the added complexity of restoring itemized deductions and will likely face significant challenges in doing so, ultimately placing an indirect strain on the resources available for their classrooms as a direct result of their increased financial burdens,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Changes favor higher-income filers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teachers who itemize may benefit more because they can deduct everything they spend, but the advantages could skew toward high-income filers, according to Gallegos. Taxpayers who itemize tend to be higher-income or homeowners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In practice, lower and many middle-income teachers are less likely to itemize, particularly if they’re renters or have modest mortgage/property tax expenses,” he said. “That means the benefit is tilted toward teachers with higher income or larger itemized deductions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weisselberger said the legislation removed a long-held tax benefit for unreimbursed teachers — miscellaneous expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lower-income educators may find that the reduction of miscellaneous expense deductions results in a disproportionate increase in their annual tax liability because they typically rely on credits, rather than itemizing deductions and/or utilizing the standard deduction,” he stated in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly every teacher spends their own money on classroom supplies, regardless of the school's location and resources, said Bridget Eaglin, a longtime early childhood educator at public and private schools in Chicago and the northwest suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many common items teachers buy, like sticky notes and project materials, are often unreimbursed since most spend more than the $300 cap, and many teachers don't itemize their expenses, a rather laborious task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eaglin, who taught preschool last year at St. Paul of the Cross in Park Ridge, estimated as many as half of teachers ultimately front the bill. In Illinois, the average teacher spent about $890 out of pocket on schools supplies during the 2024-2025 school year, according to a survey by crowdfunding site AdoptAClassroom. Nationally, the figure was $895.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resource gap between school districts is a perennial concern for students, teachers and parents, educators told the Chicago Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In better-resourced school districts, most supplies are provided by the school, parent-teacher organizations and community fundraising efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In under-resourced or inner-city schools, teachers often dig deeper into their own pockets to fill the gaps,” Gallegos said. “When the tax system removes or sharply limits deductions for those costs, it increases the real net cost to those teachers.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

An independent contractor may be penalized for missing or underpaying one of the quarterly estimated tax payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This penalty only applies to those who owe $1,000 or more in unpaid taxes. If a person is subject to this charge, they'll receive an IRS notice in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that there are special rules for taxpayers whose adjusted gross income for the previous year was more than $150,000, or $75,000 if married and filing separately. Rather than 100%, you must have paid 110% of the tax on your prior year’s return to avoid the underpayment penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Underpayment penalty rate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underpayment penalty is calculated by multiplying how much tax a person owed for each quarter by the interest rate for that quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the quarter through March, the underpayment penalty interest rate is 7%, which remains the same as it has been throughout 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Avoiding the penalty&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a person paid at least 90% of the tax on their current-year return or 100% of the tax shown on the prior year’s return, they can avoid the underpayment penalty for estimated taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way for a person to avoid an underpayment penalty in the future is to adjust withholdings on their W-4 if they have an employer. Reducing the number of dependents or adding an extra withholding amount on line 4(c) can help ensure a person is having enough tax withheld from their paycheck to cover their tax bill. One can use the IRS tax withholding estimator on its &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;website&lt;/a&gt; to check whether they're on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An independent contractor who pays quarterly estimated taxes needs to stay on top of each quarter's due date and make sure they're accurately calculating and paying what they owe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Exceptions to the underpayment penalty&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS may waive an underpayment penalty under certain circumstances, such as when:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-8d2d5d52-fcc6-11f0-9ff9-017322a4fb4d\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;A person had the majority of their income tax withheld at the beginning of the year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A person has varying income throughout the year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A person became disabled and had reasonable cause to underpay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A person retired in the last two years after reaching age 62 and had reasonable cause to underpay.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A person went through an unforeseen circumstance, like a disaster or a casualty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A person is a farmer or fisherman who paid all tax due by March 1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;If a person can’t pay their bill on time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tax return should be filed by the April 15 deadline, even if a person can’t afford to pay their bill. The IRS imposes a failure-to-file penalty on taxpayers who file late or don’t file, a fee that's typically 5% of any unpaid taxes for each month or partial month, up to a maximum of 25%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also a good idea for a person to pay as much as they can when they file. On top of the underpayment interest charge, one could face a late payment penalty — sometimes called the failure-to-pay penalty. This is an additional charge of 0.5% of any unpaid taxes for each month or partial month the tax goes unpaid, capped at 25% of a person's tax bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this all sounds a bit overwhelming, there is some good news. The IRS offers payment plans that allow taxpayers to pay their bill over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting on a payment plan can help reduce penalties. For instance, the late-payment penalty is cut in half. It can also prevent a tax levy or lien.&lt;/p&gt;",

The credit phases out for single filers with a modified adjusted gross income of $200,000, or $400,000 for those married filing jointly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But undocumented individuals or mixed status families may no longer be able to claim the credit, due to changes in the filing requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because the law now requires a parent, or spouse if filing jointly, to have a Social Security number, as well as the qualifying child. The change could impact around 176,000 children, who are U.S. citizens with undocumented parents, according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the bill passed last year, taxpayers could file with a taxpayer identification number, or TIN, which is commonly used among the immigrant community and for those without a Social Security number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a parent has little to no income tax liability, they could qualify for the additional child tax credit that provides up to $1,700 per qualifying child. The additional child tax credit allows low-income families to receive a cash payment, compared to the child tax credit that reduces a family’s tax liability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to receive the additional credit, taxpayers are required to have earned income of at least $2,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could impact veteran families, particularly those who are transitioning into the civilian workforce and may not yet have an income, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The center estimates 21,000 veteran families in Illinois could be affected by the income threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veteran and immigrant families with at least one child under 12 may still be eligible for the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/taxes/illinois-eitc-earned-income-tax-credit-claimed\"   &gt;Illinois child tax credit&lt;/a&gt;, which is 40% of a taxpayer’s state earned income tax credit, for tax year 2025. The benefit would be $300 to $600 per family, double the amount available last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Dependent care credits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a federal credit for other dependents, available to families with dependents who don’t meet the criteria to claim the child tax credit or additional child tax credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filers can claim the $500 credit for a dependent child over age 16 or another dependent relative. The credit was available under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and was made permanent with the passage of the new tax and spending bill, with the same income-based phaseouts as the child tax credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another valuable tax credit for families is the child and dependent care credit, which covers a percentage of child care expenses for children under 13 or dependents who can’t care for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act allows taxpayers to claim up to 50% of eligible expenses, starting this year. But the amount of expenses used to calculate the credit remains the same at $3,000 for one person, or $6,000 for two or more people, according to H&amp;amp;R Block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The credit also phases down at higher income levels compared to previous years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 federal tax bill expanded the annual contribution limit on dependent care accounts as well. Administered through certain employers, dependent care accounts — also known as flexible spending accounts — can now receive pretax contributions of up to $7,500 (up from $5,000) to be used for work-related child care expenses, including summer day camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Adoption tax credit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting a child can be expensive, but some parents will see a significant tax relief to help offset some of the costs. Parents can claim the credit if the child is under age 18, or physically or mentally incapable of self-care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 2025, the maximum credit for qualified adoption expenses increases to $17,820 per child, up from $16,810 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one significant change started in 2025: Taxpayers who adopt can receive a refundable credit of up to $5,000. Prior to the bill’s passing, the federal credit was nonrefundable, so it could reduce the taxes owed to zero, but it couldn’t provide a tax refund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Income limits were also adjusted under the massive bill. For the 2025 tax year, the full credit is available to filers with a modified adjusted gross income of up to $259,190. The credit phases out and becomes unavailable to those whose MAGI equals or exceeds $299,190.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Child savings accounts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also new this year: Trump Accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For American citizens who have a baby between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, the federal government will contribute $1,000 into a 530A account, also known as a Trump Account, on the child’s behalf. The account is similar to an individual retirement account and is expected to be available starting July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families can make annual after-tax contributions of up to $5,000. Employers and charitable organizations may also make contributions into the child’s account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From ages 18 to 30, the child can withdraw the funds tax-free as long as it’s used for qualifying expenses such as higher education, job training, a first-time home purchase, starting a small business or certain workforce expenses. After age 30, the money is taxed as ordinary income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents can fill out the new Form 4547 or elect to wait for an online portal that is expected to open in mid-2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Paton, partner and owner of Deerfield-based Clover CPAs and Consultants, said Trump Accounts are “not this overwhelming advantage, but it is something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the help is more limited given that Trump’s bill also cut funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the bill expanded how 529 plans can be used. The tax-advantaged accounts are an option for families who want to save for their child’s educational expenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill expanded qualifying expenses for K-12 costs to include tutoring, standardized test fees, books and more. And as of Jan. 1, parents can withdraw $20,000 per year to pay for K-12 expenses, up from $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;",

It’s a dream to be one of the thousands of small businesses that fuel the city’s economy, but I realized I needed to do my part and support local businesses now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in Chicago, I always had plenty of places to shop and services to choose from, but I never really thought about whether a business was family owned or independent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It became a habit to shop at national chains because they were the cheapest options. This includes using repair services at well-known companies rather than searching for an independent service provider. Recently, I realized I was becoming a part of a bigger problem. One that is hurting local businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, UIC Business, in partnership with the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicagolandchamber.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Small-Business-Outlook-Survey.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;conducted a study&lt;/a&gt; of small businesses in the Chicago metropolitan area. More than 200 companies across various industries completed a survey that asked about their concerns, outlook and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results in the \"expectation of business performance\" section showed that many expected their businesses to perform about the same in the next 12 months. However, UIC Business' 2025 survey &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicagolandchamber.org/statements-releases/chicagoland-chamber-of-commerce-unveils-2025-small-business-survey-findings-in-partnership-with-uic-business/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;shows a decline&lt;/a&gt; in performance confidence, dropping from 71% to 49%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hundred and forty-eight businesses participated in the 2025 survey, many of which were service-based. Fifty-seven percent said they would improve existing products or services as their specific growth strategy, with increased marketing and promotion, and adding new products or services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandy Carpenter, a Chicago event planner/stylist who founded ARK Event Styling in 2015, changed her pricing and expanded her services to help her business grow after a drop in clients during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest challenge my business faced was a sharp decline in clients as event planning and styling became financially out of reach for many families and organizations. While the desire to gather and celebrate remained, budgets were tighter, and priorities had shifted,” she said. “ARK responded by adjusting pricing, creating flexible service options and even bartering services to support clients who still wanted meaningful moments. That shift allowed us to stay in business while staying connected to the community we serve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small business owners are finding ways to grow and adjust, and I’ll do my part as a Chicagoan and use my favorite phrase, \"Put your money where your mouth is.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve made a 12-month plan to buy from a different local business or try a new service. I started with a pair of earrings from Lindsay Lewis Jewelry in Humboldt Park, and each month will have a theme. For example, in February I’ll look for a Black-owned business, in March a woman-owned one, and in April, something eco-friendly for Earth Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I plan to use local Chamber of Commerce websites and social media to find more businesses.

JB Pritzker prepared to enter back into the Illinois state capitol only to find out that the conversation he was about to hear concerning the Bears and their “next” stadium soap opera had been canceled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scrapped” is how one newspaper put it. “Postponed” is how some people apparently were referring to it on the legislative floor. “Pause to the hearing” was the term used in the statement from the Bears. “Disappointed” was Pritzker’s word choice after hearing the Bears’ statement. “Whatever” seems to be the word being tossed around by everyone else not directly connected to the process of deciding where the Bears’ home games are going to take place in 2033.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are they really doing here? What is really going on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s understanding that negotiating eight years out from the end of a residency deal is necessary, but bidding on — excuse me, bargaining between — two places outside of Chicago that have nothing to offer outside of land and opportunity (no historical or cultural connection at all) seems less like a strategy and more like a game is being played with hope that miraculously the lakefront-stadium concept will resurface at the 11:30 p.m. half-hour to keep the Chicago skyline orange and blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears’ no-show Thursday on the slowly becoming infamous House Bill 2789 leaves open doors of thought and conspiracy that have the power to backfire in the Bears’ face if they don’t play this game perfectly or things don’t magically work out in this political/business/real estate situation the way things magically did on the field for them all season. Even with their appearance in front of the Illinois House committee being rescheduled for Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three-card monte is what they seem to be playing. But this ain’t being played in the back of a CTA bus. These are three municipalities being tossed over and around and beside one another by one of the legacy franchises in sports history, pitting each one against the other to help themselves make a decision. A 55-year, over $2 billion-$4 billion decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An arduous mission. In the hands and under the watch of Bears president/CEO Kevin Warren, this is leaning toward making him the fall guy and the one to blame if — when — the Bears no longer reside in Chicago because of a tax-certainty technicality. (And the fact that Chicago has the highest sales-tax rate in the nation at 10.5%, and our tax rate on commercial properties is double the national average vs. Indiana’s set state sales tax of 7%, and a considerably lower tax rate on commercial property doesn’t help.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stress, panic and desperation of the “Hammond Bears” all enter the 36 Chambers even as the Bears continue to hold lawmakers hostage in Springfield. Is this just a ploy? A bluff? Are the Bears just using this process to better leverage the situation for them to possibly stay in Chicago? Can’t you see Hammond Mayor Thomas McDermott Jr. and Arlington Heights Village President Jim Tinaglia huddling up, trying not to argue, as they realize the game the Bears are playing could be on both of them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indiana House members of the Ways and Means Committee voted 24-0 to issue bonds to finance, lease and build a stadium that would put the Bears’ name on it. And attached to that unanimous sense of thirst comes a desperate-feeling sense of urgency because the clock is ticking. At least for this year. Indiana’s lawmakers will be in session only until Friday. For Illinois legislators, their general assembly will be in session until the end of May. Again, the Bears won’t technically become homeless until 2033.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the “fiscal responsibility” somehow lost in the “megaprojects” deal. The $84 million thrown away by vacating the lease with the Park District early, the almost $200 million ($197.2 million, to keep it exact) they let go to acquire the land in Arlington Heights if they go elsewhere, the remaining $356 million bill on the spaceship renovations done to Soldier Field in 2003. (An amount that has now been debted to us Chicago taxpayers with an added max interest that could hit us up for up to $534 million.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Math it all up. It’s only hundreds of millions in a multibillion-dollar legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon there more than likely will be a third Chicago mayor attached to this. Soon there might be a Super Bowl-contending team attached to this. Not so soon will a decision be made on where exactly the new Bears playpen will be. Because the Bears are playing all sides against one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this all speculation? Damn right it is. But it’s speculation based on moves that have made “big bank take little bank” a high-end corporate American business normality. The Bears as a franchise are probably worth more than both of the outside cities vying to build a stadium for them to play in. And they haven’t totally given up on leaving this city they call home. So ask yourself: Who’s the mack?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

He experienced some dementia. He wasn't able to work, and our life together changed a lot. I focused on supporting him through his decline until he eventually ended his own life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his death, I discovered several secrets. He hadn't been honest about his medical condition, possibly out of shame or because he wanted to protect us from the seriousness. There were also secrets about his family he may have been ashamed about. He also changed his estate plan without telling me. These secrets and betrayals show he wasn't thinking about the impact of his death upon me, and they have made me question my beliefs about our marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know his decisions weren't about my worth — they were about his fear, shame, illness and preoccupation with other family issues. But I can't tell any of this to people because I want to preserve our adult children's love and respect for their father. Also, I don't want to deal with other people trying to understand this crazy situation. This feels so unfair, and I may never be able to trust again. Do you have any advice? — &lt;i&gt;KEEPING SECRETS IN NEW ENGLAND&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR KEEPING:&lt;/b&gt; Please accept my sympathy for the loss of your husband. From what you have written, it seems the problems in your marriage started with the family secrets in addition to your husband's increasing dementia. My advice is to put an end to all of those secrets now. Telling your children the truth should not make them lose respect for their late father. Whether the people in whom you choose to confide will understand is beside the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's most important is that you free yourself from the prison of lies in which you find yourself and talk with a mental health professional if it will help you better understand how to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My family is American, through and through. We had some European ancestors back in the Ellis Island days, but we've been here for generations and identify only loosely with our European heritage. That being said, my husband and I were discussing names for our future children, and I mentioned that I would love to have a son named after my great-grandfather. His name was Jacques, but it was always pronounced like \"Jack.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I used the name, I would want to spell it the same way to honor him, but I'd feel weird pronouncing it with a French accent when I don't identify as French, nor do I have an accent. Is it OK to use the French spelling of a name and then pronounce it in an Americanized way? — &lt;i&gt;PLANNING AHEAD IN SOUTH CAROLINA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR PLANNING:&lt;/b&gt; You are the parent, and you can call your son whatever you wish. Jacques will be his formal name if you choose to use it on his birth certificate, but he can use \"Jack\" if he wishes. When he starts school, don't forget to communicate to his teachers and the administrators how his name is pronounced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Jesse Jackson&lt;/a&gt; Sr. I think you have to step outside the Chicago lens, where media familiarity does not always result in the full measure of the man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first met him when our anti-apartheid organization hosted a visitor from the African National Congress. I ended up bringing my infant daughter with me because I was a working nursing mother. He did not bat an eye. In fact, he and the great Rev. Willie Barrow invited me to join in for the announcement of the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/05/business/apartheid-pullout-by-revlon.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Revlon makeup boycott&lt;/a&gt;. This led to a lifelong collaboration and friendship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev. Jackson was incredibly media literate and a skilled speaker. He hosted numerous radio and television iterations of \"Keep Hope Alive,\" his public affairs program. Over the years, he found brilliant representatives from academia, politics and culture. He could break down complex issues and concepts, such as &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.tulsalibrary.org/black-wall-street\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Black Wall Street&lt;/a&gt;, the 2008 housing bubble and Black farming. He could smack-talk. He could pray.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I served as an occasional fill-in host on his national radio show or traveled to Detroit to work on his daughter Santita‘s TV program, I learned that members of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition were effective, committed and everywhere.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a producer for \"Chicago Tonight,\" I watched a group of Humboldt Park protesters gain strength as they shouted, \"Jesse is here,” when he appeared at their Puerto Rican protest, and cameras came too. Jesse was able to uplift voices and issues to serve others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching him celebrate his daughter surrounded by children and grandchildren, he was quiet, loving and, yes, humble.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world that is quick to cannibalize Black culture and diminish our history, what can we do in this moment?  Let’s show compassion and care, not only to his family but also to the contemporaries he leaves behind who are suffering on a personal level. Let’s get the story right and pass it on to our children with all the lessons and complexity that his life has to offer. Let’s \"Keep Hope Alive,\" with an added dose of resilience!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sylvia Ewing, vice president&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;journalism and media engagement, Public Narrative&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-2c0000\" name=\"module-2c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give us your take&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Send letters to the editor to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Jesse Jackson — an American political giant who diligently built, for multiple generations, a sturdy and reliable bridge between the 1960s Civil Rights Movement and today's fight against social and racial injustice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your 20-page special section honoring the multiple legacies of Rev. Jackson eloquently surpassed the journalistic coverage of other outstanding newspapers such as the New York Times, USA Today and the Chicago Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your historically robust visual archive of Rev. Jackson's political journey through the decades reminded me of when I saw him run for president in the 1980s when I was still a young Mexican immigrant college student. That moment made me realize that the names of Americans of color, both within and outside my community, could actually get prominent national recognition in the world of politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my view, Rev. Jackson broke the presidential race ceiling in the late 20th century for our own 21st century President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even more importantly, Rev. Jackson's moral vision for a better society, including his ongoing belief in a \"rainbow coalition\" that truly captures the multicultural American society that we have always been, offers a compelling map for how to nurture a better America for the new generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May Rev. Jesse Jackson rest in peace and power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alejandro Lugo, Park Forest&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Latino heritage rooted in Chicago &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first week of January, I traveled to Chicago to meet with historic preservation partners — from established practitioners to grassroots neighborhood leaders. In La Villita — Little Village — community leaders spoke about what it now takes to remain in place: keeping businesses open, families together and neighborhoods intact amid federal immigration enforcement pressure and ongoing uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is unfolding here reflects a national moment that is redefining how American history is interpreted and preserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the United States nears its 250th anniversary, public attention is turning toward questions of origin, belonging and national memory. Chicago has long influenced how the country understands culture, civic life and preservation. Latino communities are part of that continuum, visible across neighborhoods, institutions and public space, even when their presence is treated as recent or temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In historic neighborhoods like Little Village and Pilsen, the past is lived daily through family-owned businesses, housing stability and community networks that allow residents to remain rooted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actions such as Operation Midway Blitz, which separated thousands of families, continue to affect how residents move through their neighborhoods, how businesses operate and how communities organize for safety and mutual support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That context is why, in August, Latinos in Heritage Conservation will bring its national historic preservation conference, Congreso, to Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This region is a living archive of migration, labor, resistance and reinvention. Afro Latino, Indigenous, Mexican, Central American, Caribbean and working-class communities have shaped its cultural landscape for generations. Decisions about community safety, displacement and who is able to remain are happening now, and preservation must be part of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also a place where Latino communities have carried that legacy forward through everyday stewardship, sustaining family-owned businesses, organizing for housing stability and protecting cultural spaces that anchor community life. This year, we will gather not to observe this history, but to stand within it and to affirm clearly and publicly that we are here, and we have always been here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sehila Mota Casper, executive director, Latinos in Heritage Conservation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Funding parity for charter students is not a bailout&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent coverage of financial distress facing some &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2026/02/11/cps-charter-school-cant-make-payroll-insolvent-closed-march-aspira-chiarts-cpsboard\"   &gt;charter schools&lt;/a&gt; has focused on whether Chicago Public Schools should provide short-term financial support. The coverage mischaracterizes these payments as \"bailouts,\" when in actuality they are the foreseeable consequence of many years of structural underfunding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS is required by law to provide charter schools at least 97% of the state’s per capita tuition charge. Yet after deducting pension, debt service, management fees and other districtwide costs, charter schools receive, on average, roughly 83% of that amount. That means thousands of dollars less per student, even when charter and district-run schools serve similar student populations in the same neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one example reported by &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chalkbeat.org/chicago/2026/02/11/chicago-public-schools-charter-financial-problems/#:~:text=Does%20CPS%20fund%20charters%20equitably,the%20entire%20district%20is%20facing.\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Chalkbeat Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, two high schools with fewer than 300 students share a building on the Far South Side. Noble’s Baker College Prep, a charter public school, received $15,800 per student this year, while the district-run Bowen High School received $25,150 per student, according to CPS data. The building is the same. The students are similar. The funding is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS data also shows that 287 of 498 school buildings are categorized as underutilized. Some schools have fewer than 200 students. Douglass High School has just 28 students in a building built for 912. District-run schools receive guaranteed staffing positions regardless of enrollment and are subsidized to remain open. Charter schools, by contrast, are funded largely based on enrollment alone, even though 87% of charter students live in poverty compared with 69% in district-run schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter schools are concentrated on the South and West sides of the city, where population decline has been steepest, but the need for high-quality public schools remains urgent. These students deserve stability and equitable funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When district-run schools receive additional support to remain open, we call it equity and investment&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;When charter students seek parity with their district-run peers, it should be viewed through the same lens. Every public school student in Chicago deserves fair treatment under the law and a funding system that supports their success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Andrew Broy, president, Illinois Network of Charter Schools&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;School choice is misguided choice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame the Archdiocese of Chicago has to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2026/01/26/archdiocese-catholic-school-closing-jerome-bruno-richard-francis-borgia-stanislaus-kostka\"   &gt;close more schools &lt;/a&gt;due to lack of funding, but saving them with taxpayer funds or vouchers is not the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As education historian Dianne Ravitch &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://dianeravitch.net/2023/04/12/school-choice-will-destroy-public-schools/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;states&lt;/a&gt;, “Choice is a means to defund what should be our common good.” Redirecting funds means fewer dollars for the neediest students. Any choice model that diverts public funds to private interests destroys the social contract that is meant to strengthen public schools for the common good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer isn’t to increase the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://tax.illinois.gov/questionsandanswers/answer.28.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Illinois K-12 education expense credit&lt;/a&gt; for private education, as some suggest. That would further enable taxpayers to opt out of public education. The results would be catastrophic: more school closings due to lack of funding, lower property values and a higher likelihood of becoming the subject of a watchdog task force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The archdiocese is taking the necessary steps to ease its financial burden. To grow, it may want to consider a different approach to attract students to certain parochial schools: classical education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the parish's progressiveness, the faith community might embrace a classical education model for their children. Teachers need to work hard to ensure the school maintains state accreditation, but it has worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, over time, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://stjeromeacademy.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;St. Jerome Academy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in Hyattsville, Maryland, shifted from a traditional curriculum to a classical Catholic education, which &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.sjaclassical.org/classical-vs-progressive-education\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“consists in cultivating virtuous dispositions in students.”&lt;/a&gt; Today, the school is at total capacity with &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://streetcarsuburbs.news/st-jerome-academy-announces-major-expansion/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;waitlists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Jerome's goal was to reimagine education. It is infinitely more effective than reshuffling funds like a shell game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mary Dooms, Hoffman Estates&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bon voyage, Bears &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Chicago Bears want to build a new home in the Chicago suburbs, that's fine with me.&lt;br&gt;If they want to profit more by moving to Indiana — a location less accessible to Chicago area fans, so be it. But they won't be the Chicago Bears to me anymore, and I won't follow their exploits. Nor, I expect, will they get the Chicago media coverage they currently enjoy. Their past glories will fade into memory like any deceased relative. Hammond Hawks, anyone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charles Berg,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Hyde Park/Kenwood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Suburban sprawl&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that it's very possible that the Bears will leave &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears-stadium/2026/02/19/chicago-bears-stadium-hammond-indiana-move\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Illinois and become the Hammond Bears or the Indiana Bears&lt;/a&gt;, there will be a large vacant parcel of land in the northwest suburbs. I have a radical suggestion for the new owners of the property. They can build a racetrack there and name it Arlington Park!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Craig Jacobson, Skokie&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bears move: quarterback sneak&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't have a stake in this potential relocation, but I hate the secrecy behind the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We saw it with the New York Giants and Jets moving to the New Jersey Meadowlands Sports Complex. By the time these funding bills get passed and news releases floated, it's often a fait accompli. Negotiations typically have already taken place, between stakeholders and local elected officials and the team ownership, long before we see it in the headlines. Unfortunately, the taxpayers who fund the new stadiums are the last to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But everyone wants to be an NFL town, right? So they don't complain too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then again, a Bears move to Indiana (or to Iowa, as also rumored) could fall through — like the supposed Washington Commanders move to northern Virginia a couple years ago, which never materialized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adam Silbert, New York City&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Baseball prayers &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watching the recent &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.ncronline.org/news/music-and-multicultural-witness-ronald-hicks-begins-his-new-york-ministry\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;installation&lt;/a&gt; of Bishop Ronald Hicks, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/religion/2025/12/18/pope-leo-appoints-ronald-hicks-archbishop-new-york-replacing-cardinal-timothy-dolan\"   &gt;a Chicago area native&lt;/a&gt;, as archbishop of New York at St. Patrick's Cathedral, I remembered his recent comment that he will remain a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://longisland.news12.com/pope-names-fellow-chicagoan-bishop-ronald-hicks-as-new-archbishop-of-new-york\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Cubs fan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a Mets fan for over 60 years, I have no problem with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if Archbishop Hicks decides to replace the traditional recessional hymn after Mass with \"Go Cubs Go,\" and if the Cubs meet &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/pope-leo-xiv\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Pope Leo XIV&lt;/a&gt;'s White Sox in this year's World Series, I'll start going to Mass daily.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God bless New York AND Chicago. (God knows we both need it.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jim Vespe, Mamaroneck, New York&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

We have an office that equals it so it’s wonderful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new center has three state-of-the-art procedure rooms and has a QUAD A accreditation, relatively few facilities in Chicago have an accreditation from QUAD A, formerly the American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice is also preparing to add a hyperbaric oxygen chamber in the next few weeks. While the treatment has grown in popularity for general wellness, Dayan said his team will use it primarily to support recovery. During the therapy, a patient breathes pure oxygen while inside a special pressurized chamber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe that it helps in the healing process,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-b80000\" name=\"image-b80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5915792/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+306/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F5e%2F91551bde4bcfba9a9bed38035dfa%2Fbizfinal-01xx26-16.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e84832/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+306/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F5e%2F91551bde4bcfba9a9bed38035dfa%2Fbizfinal-01xx26-16.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bb56672/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+306/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2F5e%2F91551bde4bcfba9a9bed38035dfa%2Fbizfinal-01xx26-16.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The main lobby of Impressions Face + Body at 224 W.

Some national reports show declines for services like facial fillers, while surgery and biostimulators, or injections that help stimulate collagen production, have surged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dayan attributes some of the consumer pullback on injectables to experiencing inconsistent results across low-cost providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We trained the masses … to do paint‑by‑numbers and recipe formulas,” he said. “What we got were results that really weren’t good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the clinic's Chicago clients prefer subtlety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People don’t want to show that they’ve had anything done; they just want to look better,\" he said. “You’re going to see a Tiffany’s and Walmart divide when it comes to aesthetic experiences. And we’re going to cater to those people who want a more assured experience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clinic's move to Old Town has brought a younger clientele, more foot traffic and a sense of renewed energy, Dayan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Old Town is a lot more current. It’s more relevant; it’s more dynamic,” he said. “It’s like new energy. It’s exciting; it’s fun.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The practice also started hosting open houses and happy hours for its neighbors in the surrounding buildings. “We really want to be part of the community,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite economists anticipating broader economic challenges this year, Dayan said he remains optimistic. He’s also watching the rise of neurocosmetics, an emerging category of skincare designed to interact with the skin–brain connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your skin walks into the room before you do,” he said. “Learning how to make that better first impression … I think that’s the next big thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, he feels the practice is positioned for a strong year. “I’m very optimistic about the coming year,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListA\" data-module\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-130001\" name=\"list-130001\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\"

Follow him on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gcain.photo\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What makes this photo important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Rep. Jonathan Jackson is one of six children to survive their father, civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson. All except one of Rev. Jackson’s children were present for a news conference Wednesday in front of the family's South Shore home. They spoke about their father’s legacy and his global impact. Rev. Jackson had been battling with progressive supranuclear palsy and died Tuesday. He was a groundbreaking icon who fought alongside Martin Luther King Jr. and founded Operation PUSH. His children told emotional stories of who he was as a father and a civil rights leader, describing him as dedicated to his pursuit of social justice. Jonathan Jackson is the second oldest of the siblings, and serves in Congress as a representative of the 1st District of Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How did you get the photo?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only so many different angles you can photograph people standing behind a mic, so once the press conference was finished, I documented interactions between Rev. Jackson's children, supporters, friends and family. With my telephoto lens, I stood on a mound of dirt to see above people’s heads. Given the emotional atmosphere, I was waiting for people to hug, which this photo shows. I try to capture emotion, because it shows real human nature and helps the viewer connect to the story. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While looking around for Rev. Jackson's children, Jonathan walked in my direction and approached a supporter. I raised my camera to my eye and snapped away. This is where my telephoto lens came in handy; I zoomed into Jonathan's face, excluding unnecessary elements and focusing on his expression. I really like his expression in this photo, because at first glance you see anguish, but if you look longer, you might see a hint of a smile. Whatever you see, for me, it makes me think of his love for his father and his passion for continuing his legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Technical details:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-c99fb892-fdf8-11f0-8afa-b3d074ccce9f\" style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px; padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px; list-style: disc; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 300; letter-spacing: -0.018px; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Equipment: Sony&amp;nbsp;A7III with a 70-200mm F2.8 lens&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focal length: 70mm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shutter: 1/8000&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aperture: f/2.8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ISO: 1000&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Plus, 21 more powerful photos from Sun-Times photographers:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c40004\" name=\"image-c40004\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7c67d19/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb7%2Fc4%2Fd3c974434825a59660625f467660%2Fjacksonlocalreact-260218-04.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/089b028/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb7%2Fc4%2Fd3c974434825a59660625f467660%2Fjacksonlocalreact-260218-04.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c8c70c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb7%2Fc4%2Fd3c974434825a59660625f467660%2Fjacksonlocalreact-260218-04.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"JACKSONLOCALREACT_260218-04.JPG\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c8c70c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb7%2Fc4%2Fd3c974434825a59660625f467660%2Fjacksonlocalreact-260218-04.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d7d316c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb7%2Fc4%2Fd3c974434825a59660625f467660%2Fjacksonlocalreact-260218-04.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c8c70c9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb7%2Fc4%2Fd3c974434825a59660625f467660%2Fjacksonlocalreact-260218-04.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mourner places flowers at a memorial for Rev.

In 2024, there were 285 reported cases, while in 2025, there were 2,280 cases. The &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;number of cases&lt;/a&gt; reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as of Feb. 19 is 982 and growing. The U.S. is on track this year to have the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-measles-cases\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;most measles cases&lt;/a&gt; since 1990. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/measles-dashboard\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/5736370-map-which-states-have-the-most-measles-cases-in-2026/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/disease/measles/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt; are the states with the most cases so far this year. Illinois now has &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/measles.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;two cases&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This surge in cases places the U.S. at risk of losing its &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.astho.org/communications/blog/2026/understanding-current-us-measles-outbreaks-elimination-status/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;measles elimination status, which it has held since 2000&lt;/a&gt;, largely driven by effective measles vaccination uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some may argue that measles is a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"http://www.bowdish.ca/lab/2024/03/07/measles-is-not-a-harmless-childhood-infection-dr-bowdish-explains/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;harmless infectious disease&lt;/a&gt;, so children having measles is more of an inconvenience than a risk. This is simply not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-b20000\" name=\"module-b20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Commentary bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commentary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can cause an &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/pediatrics-articles/measles-is-still-a-very-dangerous-disease\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;acute encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;, or swelling of the brain, as well as death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a practical note, when children are infected with measles, they must be kept out of school, forcing parents and their caregivers to miss time from &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/28-fmla\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;work&lt;/a&gt; to care for them. In 2025, of the 2,267 measles cases, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;11%&lt;/a&gt; resulted in hospitalizations, and three of these patients died. Moreover, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;18% of children under 5&lt;/a&gt; who were infected had to be hospitalized. All such data demonstrates that measles is more than just a benign infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases of measles are now surfacing at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.ice.gov/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Immigration and Customs Enforcement&lt;/a&gt; (ICE) detention facilities in &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.powershealth.org/about-us/newsroom/health-library/2026/02/02/arizona-confirms-measles-case-in-ice-custody-as-state-total-rises\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-dilley-center-texas-measles-cases/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;.

Kennedy Jr.,&lt;/a&gt; who has a long &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://dcimmunized.org/rfk-jr-says-hes-not-anti-vaccine/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;history of marginalizing&lt;/a&gt; the use of vaccines to prevent diseases. He has continued to promulgate his personal beliefs and agenda by revamping the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://cdc.gov/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt;. Though vaccine hesitancy is certainly part of the risk calculus driving higher numbers of infections, the number of people &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/across-the-us-childhood-vaccination-rates-continue-to-decline\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;who continue to get vaccinated&lt;/a&gt; and support vaccination for their children remains high, albeit not as high as it was six years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisory committee also recently revamped the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.kff.org/other-health/the-new-federal-vaccine-schedule-what-changed/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;childhood immunization schedule&lt;/a&gt;, aligning it more closely with &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://vaccine-schedule.ecdc.europa.eu/Scheduler/ByCountry?SelectedCountryId=58&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeChildAgeGroup=false&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=true&amp;amp;IncludeAdultAgeGroup=false\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Denmark’s schedule&lt;/a&gt;.

Krishnamoorthi's foray into an attack ad is the first to go negative on television in the statewide race to replace  retiring U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin. And it comes as Stratton airs her first TV ad — and a pro-Stratton super PAC with &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/01/31/juliana-stratton-jb-pritzker-campaign-contribution-5-million\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;$5 million of Gov. JB Pritzker’s dollars&lt;/a&gt; being used to run pro-Stratton ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnamoorthi's campaign framed it as a response to \"six months of repeated attacks from Juliana Stratton.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhaGqq4ToO0\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;The 30-second ad&lt;/a&gt; cites a Sun-Times story that shows Stratton's &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/11/21/juliana-stratton-us-senate-bid-march-primary-corporate-pac-money\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;history of receiving money from corporate owners and directors&lt;/a&gt; into her state campaign funds, despite her Senate campaign disavowing corporate PAC money. It claims Stratton took MAGA donor money, citing research from Krishnamoorthi's campaign. The Sun-Times reported Stratton received a $2,500 contribution from Union Pacific in September 2024 into her state campaign fund, which can’t be used for her Senate run. The corporate PAC helped fund the White House ballroom. U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly, another contender in the Democratic primary race for Durbin’s seat, also received contributions from PACs affiliated with the fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ad also  cites a CBS story that reported a Stratton super PAC received a six-figure donation from ICE contractor CoreCivic. That was in reference to the Democratic Lieutenant Governor's Association PAC, which has said they'll donate money to the National Immigration Law Center. It also mentions an error on the part of Illinois Future PAC, a super PAC created to support Stratton, which had to update an ad after Krishnamoorthi’s campaign noted it appeared to violate federal campaign finance law by failing to disclose that it was not authorized by Stratton or her campaign. The PAC quickly updated the ad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Juliana Stratton. Corporate and MAGA donations, ICE contractor money, accused of breaking federal laws,\" the ad's narrator says. \"Hypocrisy we can't trust.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DU8q15METdr/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Stratton aired her first TV ad on Feb. 19&lt;/a&gt;, which features five people blankly stating, \"F*** Trump,\" and details her support for abolishing ICE and to \"hold Trump accountable for the crimes he's committed.\" Others join in on the expletive, including U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who has endorsed Stratton. Pritzker is also featured in the ad, but does not swear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Vote Juliana,\" Pritzker says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expletives are bleeped on television, but not online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratton's campaign has aired negative digital ads targeting Krishnamoorthi since August, but not on television. Krishnamoorthi has raised more than $28 million in the race and has been &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=raja+krishnamoorthi+first+tv+ad&amp;amp;sca_esv=2df5d5c022344074&amp;amp;biw=1435&amp;amp;bih=713&amp;amp;tbm=nws&amp;amp;sxsrf=ANbL-n5AKKvwQZKEZEeiHTzWbcmbKHwWcw%3A1771632461897&amp;amp;ei=TfeYaYq9NpXAp84Pxtu8mA4&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKl8GcpemSAxUV4MkDHcYtD-MQ4dUDCBA&amp;amp;uact=5&amp;amp;oq=raja+krishnamoorthi+first+tv+ad&amp;amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LW5ld3MiH3JhamEga3Jpc2huYW1vb3J0aGkgZmlyc3QgdHYgYWRIhhFQ3wVYjhBwAXgAkAEAmAF3oAHVCqoBBDEyLjO4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgWgAvIDwgIFECEYoAHCAgsQABiABBiRAhiKBcICBhAAGBYYHsICCxAAGIAEGLEDGIMBwgIFEAAYgASYAwCIBgGSBwMzLjKgB9EasgcDMy4yuAfyA8IHBTEuMS4zyAcQgAgA&amp;amp;sclient=gws-wiz-news\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;airing ads since July&lt;/a&gt;.

She was referencing the recent announcement that her Twin Cities show Saturday would be turned into an audio and visual livestream benefiting The Advocates for Human Rights, with her show in Rosemont feeling like the warmup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The messages were everywhere throughout the arena. Carlile shared that her Looking Out Foundation had already raised $25,000 for legal aid for those impacted by the Trump administration’s immigration campaign in Minnesota where Alex Pretti and Renee Good were fatally shot last month by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and encouraged attendees to also donate. On tables in the lobby, there were opportunities to write #Bramily (Brandi Family) postcards that would be distributed at the next tour stop, with the intention of providing love and encouragement to a fellow fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e20000\" name=\"image-e20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c30c69f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2Fe8%2F877a4f4b4541b958e85067c19a02%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6288303/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2Fe8%2F877a4f4b4541b958e85067c19a02%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-10.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07d6cc3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2Fe8%2F877a4f4b4541b958e85067c19a02%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Brandi Carlile performs Friday at Allstate Arena in Rosemont.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07d6cc3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2Fe8%2F877a4f4b4541b958e85067c19a02%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/23e7ccf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2Fe8%2F877a4f4b4541b958e85067c19a02%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-10.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07d6cc3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2Fe8%2F877a4f4b4541b958e85067c19a02%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandi Carlile performs Friday at Allstate Arena in Rosemont.

It kicked off just days after she delivered a rousing performance of “America the Beautiful” at the Super Bowl, further putting her on the national stage with a message of unity. It also marks her first-ever arena tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have all these lights and fake fog and s---,” she joked of the high-def stage setup where she was joined by seven additional musicians, including longtime musical partners, “the twins” Phil and Tim Hanseroth, as well as the Milwaukee-based violinist and cellist duo SistaStrings that had also accompanied her at the Super Bowl. “It feels monstrous,” Carlile added, recounting the previous times she played the city at the much smaller Schubas, Metro and Park West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years since, Carlile has racked up considerable creds: 11 Grammys, two Emmys and one Oscar nomination. She’s collaborated with her childhood hero Elton John, helped pull Joni Mitchell out of retirement, created her own festival (Girls Just Wanna Weekend) and become a producer in her own right. She’s an LGBTQ icon and beloved across genres from Americana to alt-rock, even working with her fellow Seattleites Soundgarden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e80000\" name=\"image-e80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d188b52/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+157/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F51%2F45fb2188499b993b642c9c6e8975%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-40.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1bbf7ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+157/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F51%2F45fb2188499b993b642c9c6e8975%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-40.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d38c7d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+157/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F51%2F45fb2188499b993b642c9c6e8975%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-40.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Brandi Carlile performs Friday at Allstate Arena in Rosemont.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d38c7d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+157/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F51%2F45fb2188499b993b642c9c6e8975%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-40.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/825a580/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+157/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F51%2F45fb2188499b993b642c9c6e8975%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-40.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d38c7d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+157/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F51%2F45fb2188499b993b642c9c6e8975%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-40.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandi Carlile performs Friday at Allstate Arena in Rosemont.

And even though she’s reached stardom, she has remained true to the principles that have always made her the people’s artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective was apparent from the opening notes Friday night. As Carlile kicked off the two-plus-hour set with the title track from her new album, “Returning to Myself,” she did so in silhouette from behind a large curtain that displayed a giant orange orb, conjuring the image of a baby inside the womb. As the show rolled into “Human,” and the curtain dropped, the birth of the world via celestial images came into play, which eventually eclipsed her own visage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interplay of these two songs was key to the whole show — Carlile is not only questioning her place in her own life but life at large. It’s an introspectiveness she’s always put into her music and why she’s become so relatable in the process. It’s why her heart-wrenching music syncs at just the right moments in “Grey’s Anatomy” nearly 20 years ago led to the path she’s on now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-450000\" name=\"image-450000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/caf9796/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F47%2F5451581d405590e9190b5fb7ad4b%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-11.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d7b944f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F47%2F5451581d405590e9190b5fb7ad4b%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-11.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04c3d06/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F47%2F5451581d405590e9190b5fb7ad4b%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-11.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Brandi Carlile performs at Allstate Arena in suburban Rosemont, Friday, Feb. 20, 2026. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04c3d06/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F47%2F5451581d405590e9190b5fb7ad4b%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-11.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dfd159b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F47%2F5451581d405590e9190b5fb7ad4b%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-11.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04c3d06/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F47%2F5451581d405590e9190b5fb7ad4b%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-11.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandi Carlile performs Friday at Allstate Arena in Rosemont.

He came up through the Sox’s system as a shortstop but transition to second base before reaching the majors in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chase Meidroth, however, seized most of the playing time at second during the latter stages of 2025, and Sosa was assessed with a minus-10 defensive runs saved at second. Miguel Vargas will be the Sox’s starting third baseman, and Sosa’s chances of starting at first base, where he played 42 games last season, diminished when the Sox signed Munetaka Murakami to a two-year, $34 million contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newcomers Luisangel Acuna and Tanner Murray also can play multiple infield positions, although Acuna is expected to get a long look at center field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sosa, meanwhile, intends to be more aggressive on first pitches and has no intention of raising his 3.3 percent walk rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The plan for this year is to be even more aggressive,” Sosa said. “What I mean with that is just trying to really crush pitches that are in the strike zone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Murakami on the move&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan for Munetaka Murakami is to start Sunday and Monday, followed by a day off on Tuesday. Venable indicated Murakami, who had two hits and two RBIs in his Cactus League debut Friday, likely would play Thursday and Friday before departing for Japan to train for the World Baseball Classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other scheduling news, pitchers Mike Vasil and Sean Burke are scheduled to pitch Sunday against the Brewers, and Shane Smith, Seranthony Dominguez and Grant Taylor are lined up to pitch Monday against the Rockies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Aided by ABS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitcher Aaron Hicks is a big fan of the Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) system, as evidenced by a ball that was overturned and resulted in a called third strike to Max Muncy of the Athletics in the third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've been telling people I think I might be one of the biggest beneficiaries because that ride back sinker,” Hicks said. “I feel like umpires my whole career have just kind of given up on it. That's a really important pitch for me.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hicks, who umpired youth games as a 16-year-old, didn’t mean to disrespect home plate umpire Charlie Ramos but was happy that catcher Edgar Quero requested the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the day I think we're going to trust the catchers overall,” Hicks said. “I think they probably have the best zone awareness over a pitcher. They see hundreds of pitches come in every single day.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sox 11, Athletics 2&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Edgar Quero-run single in the first inning and poked an opposite-field two-run hit to right in the third. Brooks Baldwin, battling for an outfield spot, smacked a changeup for a home run to lead off the second as the Sox collected 14 hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Shortstop Colson Montgomery looked smooth while ranging to his right while avoiding a collision with third baseman Miguel Vargas and making an accurate throw to retire Colby Thomas for the second out in the first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Left-hander Chris Murphy was delighted to throw first-pitch strikes to eight of the 10 batters he faced. He threw wild pitches, however, in the second inning that led to a run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On deck: Sox vs. Brewers, Sunday, 2:05 p.m., Glendale, Ariz. CHSN.

It would probably be a little easier to come into that thinking, like, ‘Oh, I’m in the big leagues,’ and get a big head about it. But, no, everybody is in here to work. Everybody doesn’t take for granted where they are. Nothing’s guaranteed, and I think everybody here understands that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Everybody here has got a level head. I think they understand, as well, that we’re not where we want to be, and I think they know what the work is going to look like and what they have to put into it. So it’s been great to be around these guys.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The youngsters’ eagerness to improve, such as Montgomery addressing ways to improve his contact rate, please manager Will Venable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘You get exposed to the big leagues, you understand how challenging it is,’’ Venable said. ‘‘There’s things that you’re going to have to do to not just perform well but just to survive in this league.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘And those guys got a taste of it, and I think from each one of those guys, they’re just extremely competitive. They know what it takes to put in the work, build these routines and kind of the foundation that we continue to talk about on a daily basis.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benintendi, meanwhile, gradually is working his way back after coping with inflammation and tendinitis in the Achilles that eventually sent him to the injured list for the final week of the regular season. He played much of the second half despite the discomfort but said he never was in danger of tearing the tendon and still managed to hit 20 home runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I think getting out of the box was the biggest thing,’’ Benintendi said. ‘‘You take a swing, and then your first push off is that back leg. I think we were pretty careful with it.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the injury limited Benintendi’s range, and Venable intimated his playing time in left field might be curbed, especially with plenty of competition for outfield spots. He went 0-for-3 in DH duties in the Sox’ spring game Saturday against the Athletics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We want to be mindful of what he’s been through physically and make sure he’s in a good spot,’’ Venable said. ‘‘He’s going to be having at-bats this year at the DH spot, so that’s something we want him to embrace. He’ll also be out in the outfield, and we value his defense out there.’’&lt;/p&gt;",

It would be surprising to see anybody else moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's&amp;nbsp;because the Hawks are obviously prioritizing young players, and they'll also likely need their four remaining veteran forwards (Andre Burakovsky, Tyler Bertuzzi, Teuvo Teravainen and Ryan Donato) and their cap hits to reach the salary floor next season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trade options&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are countless ways this deadline could play out, but it seems almost certain that at least a couple of those five UFAs will be moved — at least one of the forwards and one of the defensemen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dickinson and Murphy seem most likely. They have both &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/01/28/blackhawks-connor-murphy-reflects-on-tenure-chicago-home-patience\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;talked openly&lt;/a&gt; about the possibility while reflecting on their lengthy (four- and nine-year) Hawks tenures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're both consummate professionals who would appeal to contending teams for reasons beyond their on-ice impacts, and they both play positions (center and right defense) where teams often seek extra depth at the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks have two available salary-retention slots they could use to slash in half their $4.25 and $4.4 million cap hits, respectively, to make them easier for teams to absorb financially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

rookie Artyom Levshunov fell off a cliff —&amp;nbsp;and now seems relevant again to the Hawks' short-term defensive success (after getting temporarily phased into a minor role in November).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks don't want to capsize down the stretch, so if offers for Murphy don't blow them away, it's possible they could pivot and ship out Grzelcyk ($1 million cap hit) instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davidson faces a similar conundrum with the forwards. Mikheyev has enjoyed a much better season than Dickinson — for the second season in a row — and is a key reason why the Hawks' sport the league's best penalty kill. His ability to translate between English and Russian also helps Levshunov and would help Roman Kantserov next season. Many Hawks fans are eager to see him re-signed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for those same reasons, trade interest in Mikheyev ($4 million cap hit) might prove much heartier than in Dickinson. If there's a big enough gap in offers, or if Mikheyev demands a longer-term next contract than the Hawks are willing to commit to, they could conceivably trade him and keep Dickinson instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foligno is the wild card. The team captain playing out potentially his final NHL season will get to decide his own deadline fate, likely in an upcoming meeting with Davidson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trade seems unlikely, but once Davidson informs Foligno ($4.5 million cap hit) of his intention to sell, might one last playoff push with either the Blue Jackets or Bruins (his former teams) appeal to him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asking prices&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks landing a second-round pick for any of those UFAs would be impressive. They'll likely ask for that, but contenders will likely respond that a third- or fourth-round pick is the most they're willing to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could the Hawks and their trade partners look further down the road to reach an agreement?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most teams will value 2027 or 2028 picks slightly less than 2026 picks and be more willing to part with them, whereas the Hawks might actually &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2025/12/17/blackhawks-future-draft-picks-trade-purposes-rebuild-kyle-davidson\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;prefer&lt;/a&gt; 2027 or 2028 picks. That's because they already own five picks in the first two rounds of 2026 and already have an enormous prospect pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future picks could either help the Hawks space out their pipeline timeline-wise or give them more assets of predetermined value that they could turn around and trade for active NHL players in 2027 or 2028 (if they've become a contender by then).&lt;/p&gt;",

She was referencing the recent announcement that her Twin Cities show Saturday would be turned into an audio and visual livestream benefiting The Advocates for Human Rights, with her show in Rosemont feeling like the warmup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The messages were everywhere throughout the arena. Carlile shared that her Looking Out Foundation had already raised $25,000 for legal aid for those impacted by the Trump administration’s immigration campaign in Minnesota where Alex Pretti and Renee Good were fatally shot last month by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and encouraged attendees to also donate. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; On tables in the lobby, there were opportunities to write #Bramily (Brandi Family) postcards that would be distributed at the next tour stop, with the intention of providing love and encouragement to a fellow fan. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e20000\" name=\"image-e20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c30c69f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2Fe8%2F877a4f4b4541b958e85067c19a02%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6288303/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2Fe8%2F877a4f4b4541b958e85067c19a02%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-10.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07d6cc3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2Fe8%2F877a4f4b4541b958e85067c19a02%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Brandi Carlile performs Friday at Allstate Arena in Rosemont.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07d6cc3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2Fe8%2F877a4f4b4541b958e85067c19a02%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/23e7ccf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2Fe8%2F877a4f4b4541b958e85067c19a02%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-10.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07d6cc3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2Fe8%2F877a4f4b4541b958e85067c19a02%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandi Carlile performs Friday at Allstate Arena in Rosemont.

It kicked off just days after she delivered a rousing performance of “America the Beautiful” at the Super Bowl, further putting her on the national stage with a message of unity. It also marks her first-ever arena tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have all these lights and fake fog and s---,” she joked of the high-def stage setup where she was joined by seven additional musicians, including longtime musical partners, “the twins” Phil and Tim Hanseroth, as well as the Milwaukee-based violinist and cellist duo SistaStrings that had also accompanied her at the Super Bowl. “It feels monstrous,” Carlile added, recounting the previous times she played the city at the much smaller Schubas, Metro and Park West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years since, Carlile has racked up considerable creds: 11 Grammys, two Emmys and one Oscar nomination. She’s collaborated with her childhood hero Elton John, helped pull Joni Mitchell out of retirement, created her own festival (Girls Just Wanna Weekend) and become a producer in her own right. She’s an LGBTQ icon and beloved across genres from Americana to alt-rock, even working with her fellow Seattleites Soundgarden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e80000\" name=\"image-e80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d188b52/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+157/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F51%2F45fb2188499b993b642c9c6e8975%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-40.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1bbf7ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+157/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F51%2F45fb2188499b993b642c9c6e8975%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-40.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d38c7d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+157/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F51%2F45fb2188499b993b642c9c6e8975%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-40.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Brandi Carlile performs Friday at Allstate Arena in Rosemont.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d38c7d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+157/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F51%2F45fb2188499b993b642c9c6e8975%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-40.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/825a580/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+157/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F51%2F45fb2188499b993b642c9c6e8975%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-40.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d38c7d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+157/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2F51%2F45fb2188499b993b642c9c6e8975%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-40.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandi Carlile performs Friday at Allstate Arena in Rosemont.

And even though she’s reached stardom, she has remained true to the principles that have always made her the people’s artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perspective was apparent from the opening notes Friday night. As Carlile kicked off the two-plus-hour set with the title track from her new album, “Returning to Myself,” she did so in silhouette from behind a large curtain that displayed a giant orange orb, conjuring the image of a baby inside the womb. As the show rolled into “Human,” and the curtain dropped, the birth of the world via celestial images came into play, which eventually eclipsed her own visage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interplay of these two songs was key to the whole show — Carlile is not only questioning her place in her own life but life at large. It’s an introspectiveness she’s always put into her music and why she’s become so relatable in the process. It’s why her heart-wrenching music syncs at just the right moments in “Grey’s Anatomy” nearly 20 years ago led to the path she’s on now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-450000\" name=\"image-450000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/caf9796/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F47%2F5451581d405590e9190b5fb7ad4b%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-11.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d7b944f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F47%2F5451581d405590e9190b5fb7ad4b%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-11.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04c3d06/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F47%2F5451581d405590e9190b5fb7ad4b%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-11.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Brandi Carlile performs at Allstate Arena in suburban Rosemont, Friday, Feb. 20, 2026. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04c3d06/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F47%2F5451581d405590e9190b5fb7ad4b%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-11.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dfd159b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F47%2F5451581d405590e9190b5fb7ad4b%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-11.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04c3d06/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffa%2F47%2F5451581d405590e9190b5fb7ad4b%2Fbrandicarlile-260221-11.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brandi Carlile performs Friday at Allstate Arena in Rosemont.

With her family present in the arena, Carlile proudly played nearly every song on the album, which also revolves around midlife themes of losing time (“A War With Time”) and relationship battles (“No One Knows Us”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlile also performed a few cuts from her 2025 collaborative album with Sir Elton, “Who Believes in Angels?” and covers including a haunting delivery of Alanis Morissette’s “Uninvited” and a tearjerker take on Linda Ronstadt’s “Long Long Time,” all of it done with her incredible storyteller wisdom and that soaring voice that rips into your chest and holds your heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the encore, featuring a group effort including openers The Head and the Heart on Coldplay’s “Viva La Vida,” the takeaway was clear: Long live life, and long live performers like Brandi Carlile that add so much to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brandi Carlile’s “Be A Human: A Concert For Minneapolis” airs at 7 p.m. Feb. 21 on VEEPS; find more info &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://veeps.com/brandicarlile/10bee30f-604a-40a8-9c39-6a0a6553d878?utm_source=press&amp;amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;amp;utm_campaign=press-brandicarlile\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;here. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Brandi Carlile set list for Feb. 20 show at Allstate Arena&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning to Myself&lt;br&gt;Human&lt;br&gt;Mainstream Kid&lt;br&gt;Swing for the Fences (Brandi Carlile and Elton John song)&lt;br&gt;A War With Time&lt;br&gt;A Woman Oversees&lt;br&gt;Right On Time&lt;br&gt;Who Believes in Angels?
