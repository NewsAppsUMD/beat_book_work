His tongue hung out of an easy grin, in an expression that captured his youthful confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story accompanying it was a glowing profile that contrasted Crow-Armstrong’s rising stardom with his harsh self-criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it dropped on Monday, however, one quote in particular ignited a fiery reaction on social media: “I love Chicago more and more. It’s just an incredible city. The people are great. They give a shit. They aren’t just baseball fans who go to the game like Dodgers fans to take pictures and whatever. They are paying attention. They care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggregators pulled Crow-Armstrong’s words out of the story and dropped them onto graphics devoid of context. Dodgers fans’ reactions added fuel to the blaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what happens when a player reaches &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/05/03/cubs-pete-crow-armstrong-on-offensive-tear-with-permission-to-be-himself-be-a-star\"   &gt;celebrity status&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a magnetic personality and emotion-forward playing style, Crow-Armstrong is caught in the awkward push and pull of a young career under intense magnification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An MVP-level first half last year thrust Crow-Armstrong, a former first-round pick, into an even brighter spotlight. But while his gold glove defense held steady, he struggled at the plate down the stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong – acquired as a prospect in the 2021 trade that sent Javy Báez to the Mets – has won Cubs fans’ affections. But for fans outside of Chicago, the player himself can be as polarizing as his 2025 offensive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of just who Pete is and because of his talents, I think there’s always going to be very high expectations,” manager Craig Counsell said Tuesday. “That’s the blessing and the curse of being very talented, right? And that’s OK. And I think Pete understands that better than we give him credit for. He understands that very, very well. And I think he handles it very, very well. That’s part of it. You’re going to talk about people like that a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talk isn’t just about overall performance. It’s also the superhuman catch he pulled off in the outfield, or the helmet he cracked in a moment of frustration, or the blue stars he dyed into his hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrity is rarer to achieve in baseball than other sports. The game doesn't lend itself to fame the same way. There’s no guarantee that the best player on their field will end up with the ball or a bat in his hand in the biggest moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exceptions include the Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani, one of the biggest sports stars in the world. But most baseball players can maneuver about their lives in relative anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong is no Ohtani, but he's definitely not anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, a fragment of a quote critical of his hometown fanbase would cause a stir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong declined to comment on the Chicago Magazine piece Tuesday. But he’s leaned into banter with Dodgers fans in recent years, trading harmless jabs during trips to Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love playing here,” &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/04/14/cubs-pete-crow-armstrong-breaks-out-of-slow-start-in-big-way\"   &gt;Crow-Armstrong said at Dodger Stadium last April&lt;/a&gt;, after hitting two home runs in a game that clinched a series win. “It’s a fun crowd, and I like the noise. I think the Cubbies like playing here, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He paused for effect, a half smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong has an eye-popping 1.028 OPS at Dodger Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He grew up in Los Angeles and attended Harvard-Westlake High School. When he was young, Crow-Armstrong tied his fandom to specific players rather than teams. But eventually his Naperville-native dad, Matthew John Armstrong, convinced Crow-Armstrong to join the Cubs faithful. He especially had an affinity for Báez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a twist of fate that Báez’ trade would put Crow-Armstrong on track to become a Cubs star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong’s schedule Tuesday was packed with sponsorship and TV duties. But when he stepped off MLB Network’s temporary set at the Cubs’ spring training complex, he spotted a kid holding a sign that read, “PCA is my hero,” and beelined to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chatting about the Javy Báez baseball card the young fan handed him – the boy explained, “You’re my favorite player, and I know your favorite player is Javy.” – Crow-Armstrong was in his element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrity brings wholesome moments, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

It took awhile, but at 9:18 p.m. ET Trump made his first mention of former President Joe Biden, saying he was the worst. He lobbed another dart  at Biden at 9:19 p.m. ET. &lt;i&gt;Update posted 8:35 p.m. CT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chamber stands for USA men’s hockey team in moment of rare unity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump introduced the men's gold medal team and talked hockey for a bit. The team entered the chamber through the House Press Gallery that is above the podium, where the reporters on deadline work. The USA women's hockey team, Trump said, will be coming to the White House. Don't know when. Democrats and Republicans applauded the team.

Trump called the court 6-3 ruling striking down his tariffs as \"very unfortunate\" and then challenged their power, claiming he had the \"legal power\" to do what he wanted in keeping up the tariffs. Also said \"congressional action\" was not necessary. In a chamber with members from all three branches of government, Trump said that he was the only one with tariff power. Barrett stared hard at the president, but hers was not a poker face. Her stare spoke volumes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also said tariffs are paid for by foreign nations. Tariffs are paid for by U.S. based companies bringing in the goods, with high costs often &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-midsized-companies-costs-consumers-2a25158ff1d06bd7f72d909a8ec64f25\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;passed on to consumers&lt;/a&gt;, recent report finds. &lt;i&gt;Update posted 9:10 p.m. CT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’m watching for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will he mention Chicago?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s first year had a profound impact in Chicago and the state of Illinois. Among the Chicago-related things that could come up: insults aimed at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/illinois-governor\"   &gt;Gov. JB Pritzker&lt;/a&gt; and Mayor Brandon Johnson; the Trump administration's Chicago deportation campaign and the cost of the Obama Presidential Center, a more frequent Trump target as the center gets ready to open later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will this be a speech to all Americans or to Trump’s MAGA base?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s go-to place is to play to his base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What about Iran?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Trump offer some guiding principles for attacking Iran and tell Congress — to their faces — they have no say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What about pocketbook issues?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a good bet that Trump will claim everything is cheaper. Please refer to your personal experiences and wallet when Trump almost certainly brings this up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Immigration likely to be major talking point&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What will Trump say about the deaths in Minneapolis? How will he defend ICE and Border Patrol?&lt;/p&gt;",

According to Donovan, Simons actually has an existing fracture in the hand that he’s been dealing with since training camp with the Celtics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialist said it did not require surgery unless it worsens or persists, so the hope is to have the guard back sooner than later. That’s the hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He did have some difficulty in Boston with it in training camp and missed a little bit of time, maybe 10 days with it,” Donovan said. “The fracture hasn’t quite healed and I think him seeing a hand specialist they decided that once the pain subsides, he’s fine to go back to play. I don’t know how long that’s going to be. If I go off the last time it happened to him in Boston it was a week-to-10 days. That’s where it’s at. I don’t know what will happen at the end of the year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit tricker with Ivey. The former Piston suffered a broken fibula last season in Detroit, missed the remainder of the season and returned this year. He did not return the same explosive Ivey he was out of Purdue, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was obvious in his first four games with the Bulls, and beyond concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We started him on a program, right now just to ramp him up physically,” Donovan said. “A lot of it has been to get the strength back in around his knee. That process started a couple days ago, so he’s in the midst of doing that. Talking to the medical guys it’s going to be pretty intense for him, the program to get the strength back as quickly as possible, so he’s going to have to really work hard on that part of it. I think he feels better not playing, the pain has subsided, but the biggest concern the medical guys have is his strength. That his quad is firing, he can cut and move, be the athlete that he’s been.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds good, but there are only 24 games left and each day the runway gets a bit shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coby White had a lot to say in his return to the United Center with Charlotte, and a lot of it centered around how important Donovan was for his development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I give him a lot of credit for how far I came,” White said. “When you’re a young player he is very hard on you. It’s a lot of tough love, but it’s because he sees something in you and he’s from New York, he’s battle-tested, so that’s his way to kind of see how tough you are. Can you respond?

And pitchers’ velocities generally increase through the spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I want to preface by saying, for me, velo isn’t everything,’’ Imanaga said through an interpreter. ‘‘But having velocity obviously is an advantage. Today, [I] felt like the velo was up. So just overall, my takeaway was that it was a good start.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imanaga isn’t a power pitcher by any means, but he was slow to regain velocity last season after suffering a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/10/06/how-shota-imanagas-throwing-philosopher-side-came-out-post-injury-nlds-brewers-game-2\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;strained hamstring in May&lt;/a&gt;. His fastball averaged 90.8 mph in 2025, compared with 91.7 the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a subtle difference, but when Imanaga’s fastball velocity is up, it creates more separation from his splitter, which is his go-to secondary pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I was really happy with how he left [last season],’’ manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell&lt;/b&gt; said, regardless of Imanaga’s struggles down the stretch and into the playoffs. ‘‘Very confident that he would put himself in a very good position, and he was ready to do that.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Imanaga allowed three hits in 2‰ scoreless innings against the Padres. The hardest pitch he threw was a 94.1 mph heater on the outside corner to strike out infielder &lt;b&gt;Sung-Mun Song&lt;/b&gt; swinging in the first inning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Long still eyeing WBC&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First baseman &lt;b&gt;Jonathon Long&lt;/b&gt; moved his flight date to join Team Chinese Taipei from Tuesday to Friday, Counsell said. His recovery since &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/21/how-tokyo-series-prepared-cubs-matthew-boyd-for-wbc-ramp-up\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;spraining his left elbow in an in-game collision Saturday&lt;/a&gt; has been promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘He’s doing much better,’’ Counsell said. ‘‘No issue with X-rays or anything like that. The soreness is dissipating. Still a little residual soreness, but it’s the kind that’s improving every day.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long took swings Tuesday, Counsell said, and he’ll ramp up his activity in the next couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘He doesn’t really want to get on a plane and have some question about his availability,’’ Counsell said. ‘‘He’s trending well.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conforto in camp&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outfielder &lt;b&gt;Michael Conforto&lt;/b&gt; joined the team workout Tuesday, running through defensive drills on the back fields with a couple of new teammates before taking batting practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs declined to make him available to the media because &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/23/cubs-signing-outfielder-michael-conforto-to-minor-league-deal\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;his minor-league deal&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t official yet, but he sat down with Counsell earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I thought Michael laid it out really well, where he’s at,’’ Counsell said. ‘‘He’s in a good place. You learn from all your experiences, [and it] puts you in a good place. You have uncertainty when you come to camp on a non-roster deal, and I think he’s in a position to use that uncertainty in a really good way.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counsell said he expects to get Conforto into the lineup Sunday, giving him four days of camp to build up.&lt;/p&gt;",

The building is clad in light blue glazed brick — a rare color choice for a house of worship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with its classical proportions, but modern, almost proto-Art Deco detailing, the church somehow managed to be classic and contemporary for its time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-8e0000\" name=\"image-8e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/13cc824/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/41171cd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/471cbcf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Architectural detail of a cross in the brick structure of the Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/471cbcf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5b1c74a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/471cbcf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the architectural details on the north face of the Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The church was designated a Chicago landmark in 1989 and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan Missionary Baptist congregation bought the building in 1947. And in 1953, the church caught the attention of Life magazine and its famed photographer Gordon Parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parks' &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.gordonparksfoundation.org/education/features/the-great-home-in-the-wilderness\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;black-and-white images&lt;/a&gt; documented baptisms, prayer, smiling children in their Sunday finest and the large congregation worshiping inside Metropolitan's glorious sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, the magazine ended up not publishing Parks' photos or the accompanying story he wrote. But the emphatic images ended up finding a life of their own and wound up being widely seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Gordon Parks Foundation, in the photographer's unpublished manuscript, he called Metropolitan \"a temple of hope to thousands of Negro people caught in the backyard of this vast city. It is a haven in a world of unending trouble.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund grants were awarded a month after the group handed out &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://savingplaces.org/press-center/media-resources/action-fund-5m-mlk-pbc-grants-2026\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;$5 million&lt;/a&gt; in grants to five historic Black churches on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The churches included Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ, 4021 S.

But it’s still trying to “crack the code” outside of its home market with people unfamiliar with the brand, Miles said during its Tuesday earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company underscored smaller-format new restaurants to help lower costs. In fiscal year 2025, food, beverage and packaging costs rose 4.1% due to inflation, including higher commodity prices for beef and pork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue for fiscal year 2025, ended Dec. 28, rose 3% year-over-year to $732.1 million, due primarily to recent restaurant openings. But same-restaurant sales, or those open for at least 24 months, fell 0.5%. Net income was $21.1 million, compared to more than $35 million in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fourth quarter 2025, revenue was $185.7 million, compared to $184.6 million the previous year. Net income fell more than 49% to nearly $6.3 million, compared to $12.4 million in fourth quarter 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dick Portillo founded Portillo’s in 1963 in Villa Park. It has since grown from a small hot dog trailer to more than 100 restaurants across 11 states. Last year, the company launched eight restaurants in Texas, Georgia, Florida, Arizona and Plainfield.&lt;/p&gt;",

Sources say Cortopassi was laid off in the middle of his shift, leaving Micah Materre to work solo on the anchor desk Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The layoffs follow a recent round of behind-the-scenes cuts that included copywriters, circumstances that have touched local network affiliates but rarely have hit “Chicago’s Very Own.” One veteran TV reporter had never seen this many cuts at once from a Chicago station. They come as WGN parent company Nexstar is working to merge with Tegna in a deal that’s under regulatory review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nexstar spokesperson said in a statement to the Sun-Times: “Nexstar does not comment on personnel issues, but the company is taking steps necessary to compete effectively in this period of unprecedented change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts shook up WGN's anchor schedule. According to sources, Patrick Elwood will anchor solo at noon, Lourdes Duarte will do the same at 4 p.m., Ben Bradley will join Duarte at 5 and Micah Materre will join Bradley at 6. Materre also will anchor solo from 9 to 10:30. The popular morning-news crew is expected to stay intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the talents let go are nationally known from WGN's days as a superstation, when its programming beamed via cable and satellite across the country. Richards joined WGN in 1991 as a staff announcer and became a regular contributor in 1998. Crews has covered the city and state since 1996. Boden has covered sports for more than 30 years at a half-dozen Chicago TV and radio stations. Wang began at the defunct CLTV in 1995 before joining WGN in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The layoffs are an apparent effort to cut costs in anticipation of the excessive debt Nexstar will incur from money borrowed to buy Tegna. In August, Nexstar announced it would acquire Tegna for $6.2 billion, creating a broadcast behemoth that would cover about 80% of U.S. TV households. The deal requires the Federal Communications Commission to lift its 39% ownership cap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WGN is still very profitable, despite changes in viewing habits, but the cuts have to come from somewhere, through no fault of the employees affected. Nexstar already has been carrying the debt from its $4.1 billion purchase of Tribune Media in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratings-wise, WGN News performs great in the morning, dominates Fox 32 at 9 p.m. and is competitive at 10. Its morning-news show is emulated by other stations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;",
