His tongue hung out of an easy grin, in an expression that captured his youthful confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story accompanying it was a glowing profile that contrasted Crow-Armstrong’s rising stardom with his harsh self-criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it dropped on Monday, however, one quote in particular ignited a fiery reaction on social media: “I love Chicago more and more. It’s just an incredible city. The people are great. They give a shit. They aren’t just baseball fans who go to the game like Dodgers fans to take pictures and whatever. They are paying attention. They care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggregators pulled Crow-Armstrong’s words out of the story and dropped them onto graphics devoid of context. Dodgers fans’ reactions added fuel to the blaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what happens when a player reaches &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/05/03/cubs-pete-crow-armstrong-on-offensive-tear-with-permission-to-be-himself-be-a-star\"   &gt;celebrity status&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a magnetic personality and emotion-forward playing style, Crow-Armstrong is caught in the awkward push and pull of a young career under intense magnification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An MVP-level first half last year thrust Crow-Armstrong, a former first-round pick, into an even brighter spotlight. But while his gold glove defense held steady, he struggled at the plate down the stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong – acquired as a prospect in the 2021 trade that sent Javy Báez to the Mets – has won Cubs fans’ affections. But for fans outside of Chicago, the player himself can be as polarizing as his 2025 offensive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of just who Pete is and because of his talents, I think there’s always going to be very high expectations,” manager Craig Counsell said Tuesday. “That’s the blessing and the curse of being very talented, right? And that’s OK. And I think Pete understands that better than we give him credit for. He understands that very, very well. And I think he handles it very, very well. That’s part of it. You’re going to talk about people like that a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talk isn’t just about overall performance. It’s also the superhuman catch he pulled off in the outfield, or the helmet he cracked in a moment of frustration, or the blue stars he dyed into his hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrity is rarer to achieve in baseball than other sports. The game doesn't lend itself to fame the same way. There’s no guarantee that the best player on their field will end up with the ball or a bat in his hand in the biggest moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exceptions include the Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani, one of the biggest sports stars in the world. But most baseball players can maneuver about their lives in relative anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong is no Ohtani, but he's definitely not anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, a fragment of a quote critical of his hometown fanbase would cause a stir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong declined to comment on the Chicago Magazine piece Tuesday. But he’s leaned into banter with Dodgers fans in recent years, trading harmless jabs during trips to Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love playing here,” &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/04/14/cubs-pete-crow-armstrong-breaks-out-of-slow-start-in-big-way\"   &gt;Crow-Armstrong said at Dodger Stadium last April&lt;/a&gt;, after hitting two home runs in a game that clinched a series win. “It’s a fun crowd, and I like the noise. I think the Cubbies like playing here, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He paused for effect, a half smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong has an eye-popping 1.028 OPS at Dodger Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He grew up in Los Angeles and attended Harvard-Westlake High School. When he was young, Crow-Armstrong tied his fandom to specific players rather than teams. But eventually his Naperville-native dad, Matthew John Armstrong, convinced Crow-Armstrong to join the Cubs faithful. He especially had an affinity for Báez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a twist of fate that Báez’ trade would put Crow-Armstrong on track to become a Cubs star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong’s schedule Tuesday was packed with sponsorship and TV duties. But when he stepped off MLB Network’s temporary set at the Cubs’ spring training complex, he spotted a kid holding a sign that read, “PCA is my hero,” and beelined to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chatting about the Javy Báez baseball card the young fan handed him – the boy explained, “You’re my favorite player, and I know your favorite player is Javy.” – Crow-Armstrong was in his element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrity brings wholesome moments, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

It took awhile, but at 9:18 p.m. ET Trump made his first mention of former President Joe Biden, saying he was the worst. He lobbed another dart  at Biden at 9:19 p.m. ET. &lt;i&gt;Update posted 8:35 p.m. CT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chamber stands for USA men’s hockey team in moment of rare unity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump introduced the men's gold medal team and talked hockey for a bit. The team entered the chamber through the House Press Gallery that is above the podium, where the reporters on deadline work. The USA women's hockey team, Trump said, will be coming to the White House. Don't know when. Democrats and Republicans applauded the team.

Trump called the court 6-3 ruling striking down his tariffs as \"very unfortunate\" and then challenged their power, claiming he had the \"legal power\" to do what he wanted in keeping up the tariffs. Also said \"congressional action\" was not necessary. In a chamber with members from all three branches of government, Trump said that he was the only one with tariff power. Barrett stared hard at the president, but hers was not a poker face. Her stare spoke volumes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also said tariffs are paid for by foreign nations. Tariffs are paid for by U.S. based companies bringing in the goods, with high costs often &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-midsized-companies-costs-consumers-2a25158ff1d06bd7f72d909a8ec64f25\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;passed on to consumers&lt;/a&gt;, recent report finds. &lt;i&gt;Update posted 9:10 p.m. CT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’m watching for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will he mention Chicago?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s first year had a profound impact in Chicago and the state of Illinois. Among the Chicago-related things that could come up: insults aimed at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/illinois-governor\"   &gt;Gov. JB Pritzker&lt;/a&gt; and Mayor Brandon Johnson; the Trump administration's Chicago deportation campaign and the cost of the Obama Presidential Center, a more frequent Trump target as the center gets ready to open later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will this be a speech to all Americans or to Trump’s MAGA base?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s go-to place is to play to his base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What about Iran?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Trump offer some guiding principles for attacking Iran and tell Congress — to their faces — they have no say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What about pocketbook issues?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a good bet that Trump will claim everything is cheaper. Please refer to your personal experiences and wallet when Trump almost certainly brings this up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Immigration likely to be major talking point&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What will Trump say about the deaths in Minneapolis? How will he defend ICE and Border Patrol?&lt;/p&gt;",

According to Donovan, Simons actually has an existing fracture in the hand that he’s been dealing with since training camp with the Celtics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialist said it did not require surgery unless it worsens or persists, so the hope is to have the guard back sooner than later. That’s the hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He did have some difficulty in Boston with it in training camp and missed a little bit of time, maybe 10 days with it,” Donovan said. “The fracture hasn’t quite healed and I think him seeing a hand specialist they decided that once the pain subsides, he’s fine to go back to play. I don’t know how long that’s going to be. If I go off the last time it happened to him in Boston it was a week-to-10 days. That’s where it’s at. I don’t know what will happen at the end of the year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit tricker with Ivey. The former Piston suffered a broken fibula last season in Detroit, missed the remainder of the season and returned this year. He did not return the same explosive Ivey he was out of Purdue, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was obvious in his first four games with the Bulls, and beyond concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We started him on a program, right now just to ramp him up physically,” Donovan said. “A lot of it has been to get the strength back in around his knee. That process started a couple days ago, so he’s in the midst of doing that. Talking to the medical guys it’s going to be pretty intense for him, the program to get the strength back as quickly as possible, so he’s going to have to really work hard on that part of it. I think he feels better not playing, the pain has subsided, but the biggest concern the medical guys have is his strength. That his quad is firing, he can cut and move, be the athlete that he’s been.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds good, but there are only 24 games left and each day the runway gets a bit shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coby White had a lot to say in his return to the United Center with Charlotte, and a lot of it centered around how important Donovan was for his development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I give him a lot of credit for how far I came,” White said. “When you’re a young player he is very hard on you. It’s a lot of tough love, but it’s because he sees something in you and he’s from New York, he’s battle-tested, so that’s his way to kind of see how tough you are. Can you respond?

And pitchers’ velocities generally increase through the spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I want to preface by saying, for me, velo isn’t everything,’’ Imanaga said through an interpreter. ‘‘But having velocity obviously is an advantage. Today, [I] felt like the velo was up. So just overall, my takeaway was that it was a good start.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imanaga isn’t a power pitcher by any means, but he was slow to regain velocity last season after suffering a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/10/06/how-shota-imanagas-throwing-philosopher-side-came-out-post-injury-nlds-brewers-game-2\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;strained hamstring in May&lt;/a&gt;. His fastball averaged 90.8 mph in 2025, compared with 91.7 the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a subtle difference, but when Imanaga’s fastball velocity is up, it creates more separation from his splitter, which is his go-to secondary pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I was really happy with how he left [last season],’’ manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell&lt;/b&gt; said, regardless of Imanaga’s struggles down the stretch and into the playoffs. ‘‘Very confident that he would put himself in a very good position, and he was ready to do that.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Imanaga allowed three hits in 2‰ scoreless innings against the Padres. The hardest pitch he threw was a 94.1 mph heater on the outside corner to strike out infielder &lt;b&gt;Sung-Mun Song&lt;/b&gt; swinging in the first inning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Long still eyeing WBC&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First baseman &lt;b&gt;Jonathon Long&lt;/b&gt; moved his flight date to join Team Chinese Taipei from Tuesday to Friday, Counsell said. His recovery since &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/21/how-tokyo-series-prepared-cubs-matthew-boyd-for-wbc-ramp-up\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;spraining his left elbow in an in-game collision Saturday&lt;/a&gt; has been promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘He’s doing much better,’’ Counsell said. ‘‘No issue with X-rays or anything like that. The soreness is dissipating. Still a little residual soreness, but it’s the kind that’s improving every day.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long took swings Tuesday, Counsell said, and he’ll ramp up his activity in the next couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘He doesn’t really want to get on a plane and have some question about his availability,’’ Counsell said. ‘‘He’s trending well.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conforto in camp&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outfielder &lt;b&gt;Michael Conforto&lt;/b&gt; joined the team workout Tuesday, running through defensive drills on the back fields with a couple of new teammates before taking batting practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs declined to make him available to the media because &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/23/cubs-signing-outfielder-michael-conforto-to-minor-league-deal\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;his minor-league deal&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t official yet, but he sat down with Counsell earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I thought Michael laid it out really well, where he’s at,’’ Counsell said. ‘‘He’s in a good place. You learn from all your experiences, [and it] puts you in a good place. You have uncertainty when you come to camp on a non-roster deal, and I think he’s in a position to use that uncertainty in a really good way.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counsell said he expects to get Conforto into the lineup Sunday, giving him four days of camp to build up.&lt;/p&gt;",

The building is clad in light blue glazed brick — a rare color choice for a house of worship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with its classical proportions, but modern, almost proto-Art Deco detailing, the church somehow managed to be classic and contemporary for its time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-8e0000\" name=\"image-8e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/13cc824/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/41171cd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/471cbcf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Architectural detail of a cross in the brick structure of the Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/471cbcf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5b1c74a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/471cbcf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the architectural details on the north face of the Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The church was designated a Chicago landmark in 1989 and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan Missionary Baptist congregation bought the building in 1947. And in 1953, the church caught the attention of Life magazine and its famed photographer Gordon Parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parks' &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.gordonparksfoundation.org/education/features/the-great-home-in-the-wilderness\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;black-and-white images&lt;/a&gt; documented baptisms, prayer, smiling children in their Sunday finest and the large congregation worshiping inside Metropolitan's glorious sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, the magazine ended up not publishing Parks' photos or the accompanying story he wrote. But the emphatic images ended up finding a life of their own and wound up being widely seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Gordon Parks Foundation, in the photographer's unpublished manuscript, he called Metropolitan \"a temple of hope to thousands of Negro people caught in the backyard of this vast city. It is a haven in a world of unending trouble.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund grants were awarded a month after the group handed out &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://savingplaces.org/press-center/media-resources/action-fund-5m-mlk-pbc-grants-2026\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;$5 million&lt;/a&gt; in grants to five historic Black churches on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The churches included Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ, 4021 S.

But it’s still trying to “crack the code” outside of its home market with people unfamiliar with the brand, Miles said during its Tuesday earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company underscored smaller-format new restaurants to help lower costs. In fiscal year 2025, food, beverage and packaging costs rose 4.1% due to inflation, including higher commodity prices for beef and pork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue for fiscal year 2025, ended Dec. 28, rose 3% year-over-year to $732.1 million, due primarily to recent restaurant openings. But same-restaurant sales, or those open for at least 24 months, fell 0.5%. Net income was $21.1 million, compared to more than $35 million in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fourth quarter 2025, revenue was $185.7 million, compared to $184.6 million the previous year. Net income fell more than 49% to nearly $6.3 million, compared to $12.4 million in fourth quarter 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dick Portillo founded Portillo’s in 1963 in Villa Park. It has since grown from a small hot dog trailer to more than 100 restaurants across 11 states. Last year, the company launched eight restaurants in Texas, Georgia, Florida, Arizona and Plainfield.&lt;/p&gt;",

Sources say Cortopassi was laid off in the middle of his shift, leaving Micah Materre to work solo on the anchor desk Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The layoffs follow a recent round of behind-the-scenes cuts that included copywriters, circumstances that have touched local network affiliates but rarely have hit “Chicago’s Very Own.” One veteran TV reporter had never seen this many cuts at once from a Chicago station. They come as WGN parent company Nexstar is working to merge with Tegna in a deal that’s under regulatory review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nexstar spokesperson said in a statement to the Sun-Times: “Nexstar does not comment on personnel issues, but the company is taking steps necessary to compete effectively in this period of unprecedented change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts shook up WGN's anchor schedule. According to sources, Patrick Elwood will anchor solo at noon, Lourdes Duarte will do the same at 4 p.m., Ben Bradley will join Duarte at 5 and Micah Materre will join Bradley at 6. Materre also will anchor solo from 9 to 10:30. The popular morning-news crew is expected to stay intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the talents let go are nationally known from WGN's days as a superstation, when its programming beamed via cable and satellite across the country. Richards joined WGN in 1991 as a staff announcer and became a regular contributor in 1998. Crews has covered the city and state since 1996. Boden has covered sports for more than 30 years at a half-dozen Chicago TV and radio stations. Wang began at the defunct CLTV in 1995 before joining WGN in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The layoffs are an apparent effort to cut costs in anticipation of the excessive debt Nexstar will incur from money borrowed to buy Tegna. In August, Nexstar announced it would acquire Tegna for $6.2 billion, creating a broadcast behemoth that would cover about 80% of U.S. TV households. The deal requires the Federal Communications Commission to lift its 39% ownership cap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WGN is still very profitable, despite changes in viewing habits, but the cuts have to come from somewhere, through no fault of the employees affected. Nexstar already has been carrying the debt from its $4.1 billion purchase of Tribune Media in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratings-wise, WGN News performs great in the morning, dominates Fox 32 at 9 p.m. and is competitive at 10. Its morning-news show is emulated by other stations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;",

Fahy said she hadn’t ever banked in one three, let alone two, in a game before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it didn’t matter because they were important,” said Fahy, who scored 17 points in Maine South’s 55-48 win over Lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks’ 4A sectional semifinal win showed the team’s relentlessness. They trailed by as many as 12 points in the first half but trimmed the deficit to seven at halftime. That’s when the Hawks knew they had to make a change to complete the comeback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We just, like, needed to relax,” Fahy said. “ Like we were all too razzled, it’s the playoffs. Everyone's excited. [Coach Jeff Haman] was like, ‘You guys need to relax and rebound.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pep talk paid off as the Hawks surged out of halftime with a renewed sense of urgency. They boxed out, did a better job of defending Lane’s backdoor cuts, and got into more of a flow offensively. Fahy, junior guard Phoebe O’Shea and junior forward Evelina Sotos all hit a three in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a different fervor from the Hawks in the third quarter. They weren’t going to be deterred from completing the comeback. On one play, Sotos ran to the right corner and corralled a loose ball to give Maine South an extra possession. The ball eventually swung back to Sotos, and she drilled a three-pointer. Senior guard Gianna LaVecchia knocked down two free throws at the end of the third quarter to give Maine South its first lead since the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are resilient, tough, and a group that loves each other,” Hamann said. “When you have that love for each other … [combined with] the toughness and the resiliency, we can do some great things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lane was very impressive on Tuesday. The Champions were active on the glass and held a lead for the majority of the game. But foul trouble and double-digit turnovers plagued the Champions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All the credit goes to Lane,” Hamann said. “They're young, and they're good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks are a team that uses the majority of their roster. It’s not uncommon for the Hawks to play 10 players in a game. Fahy’s points were huge, but O’Shea’s 13 points were also critical off the bench. She had some tough drives to the basket to either convert at the basket or draw a foul. She’s also a knockdown shooter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She's amazing off the bench,” Fahy said of O’Shea. “She's like a hidden weapon. When [opposing players] come down the court, people are like, ‘Oh, shoot.’ She's always ready for those moments, and she knows her role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Maine South’s win, its fan base stormed the court to celebrate with the Hawks. This was a confidence-boosting win for the Hawks going into the 4A sectional championship against Loyola on Thursday at Maine South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm really proud of them [that] in a game that we weren't at our best and things weren't flowing the way we wanted to, we still found a way in a state playoff game in this atmosphere,” Haman said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

I hold myself to really high standards, and it was not what I expected or wanted. But I had a really good offseason and am prepared for better things this season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said his “ups and downs” taught him a lot about himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You keep going through it and grinding every day, stick to your routine and hammer it out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After extending his season in the fall league (14 innings, 2.57 ERA, 21 strikeouts, six walks), Smith finds himself ramping up behind many of the other pitchers in camp. He threw 23 pitches in his first live batting practice Tuesday at Camelback Ranch and expects his first game action March 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and &lt;b&gt;Noah Schultz&lt;/b&gt;, another lefty drafted in the first round (2022), are expected to open the season at Triple-A Charlotte but could debut with the big-league team by midseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Put Mune on the board&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Munetaka Murakami’s&lt;/b&gt; attempt at a &lt;b&gt;Hawk Harrelson&lt;/b&gt; home-run call on camera was the latest example of the Japanese slugger’s fun side, which should make him a fan favorite in his first MLB season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He certainly takes it seriously, like all these guys do,” manager &lt;b&gt;Will Venable &lt;/b&gt;said. “When it’s time to play baseball, he’s very serious. But there is definitely a lighter side to Mune. He’s got a big personality, funny dude, and definitely likes to joke around with the guys. Time and place for everything, but he’s doing a great job being locked in on the field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami, an infielder, signed a two-year, $34 million deal in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Manager’s corner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venable said shortstop &lt;b&gt;Colson Montgomery&lt;/b&gt;, who was out for a second day Tuesday with an unspecified illness, was feeling a little bit better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’’ll see where he’s at [Wednesday],” Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• There’s no estimate yet on when center fielder &lt;b&gt;Everson Pereira&lt;/b&gt;, acquired in an offseason trade with the Rays, will return to game action after experiencing tightness in his right side, Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Especially with that side stuff, you just don’t want to mess around and turn it into a longer stint than it needs to be,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Versatile infielder &lt;b&gt;Tanner Murray&lt;/b&gt;, acquired for right-handers &lt;b&gt;Steven Wilson&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Yoendrys Gomez &lt;/b&gt;in the same trade that brought Pereira, played in his third game at shortstop and drove in three runs with a homer and a double.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;b&gt;Lenyn Sosa&lt;/b&gt; started at third base, where he played 54 games in 2024 but only 18 last season. Sosa, who had 22 homers and 75 RBI in 2025, is no Gold Glover but needs to be available at second, first and third to ensure his share of at-bats, Venable said. He singled and doubled in four plate appearances Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sox 12, Mariners 10&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a second-tier lineup, the Sox (4-1) cranked out 16 hits in a 3-hour, 48-minute game in Peoria, hiking their spring total to 60 hits. &lt;b&gt;Brooks Baldwin&lt;/b&gt; (double, two singles) led the way with three hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Left-hander &lt;b&gt;Anthony Kay&lt;/b&gt;, one of three pitchers, along with &lt;b&gt;Shane Smith &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Davis Martin&lt;/b&gt;, who have all-but guaranteed rotation spots, allowed one run, one hit and two walks over two innings in his first spring start. Signed as a free agent after ERAs of 1.74 and 1.54 his last two seasons in Japan, Kay said he was initially over-amped as he made his first start in a major-league uniform since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Righty &lt;b&gt;Wikelman Gonzalez&lt;/b&gt;, one of the prospects acquired in the &lt;b&gt;Garrett Crochet&lt;/b&gt; trade, walked two and gave up three hits, including &lt;b&gt;Cal Raleigh’s&lt;/b&gt; first spring homer, in his one inning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The Sox turned a pair of double plays but surrendered a run on catcher &lt;b&gt;Edgar Quero’s&lt;/b&gt; way-high throw to third base on a rundown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;b&gt;On deck: &lt;/b&gt;Reds at Sox, 2:05 p.m. Wednesday, Glendale, &lt;b&gt;Nick Lodolo &lt;/b&gt;vs. &lt;b&gt;Davis Martin&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",

Meanwhile, White’s former team (24-35) has lost 10 straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way the season was going, we really weren’t stacking enough wins consistently, so like I always said from the jump, I support whatever they think is best for the team,” White said of the Bulls’ decision to move him. “This organization believed in me. They gave me a chance and an opportunity to live out my dreams. So I just want to see the organization succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might not be for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing in his first game since the trade, White was recovered enough from a strained calf to get 16 minutes off the bench, scoring 10 points on 4-for-9 shooting. Not that the Hornets needed much from him. They outscored the Bulls 42-16 in the third quarter, including getting 17 points off 10 Bulls turnovers. They also had 14 fast break points in the quarter and 12 assists to the Bulls’ two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The turnovers are a problem — they are a major problem, and we have to continue to get that resolved,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “When there are mistakes that are made and they are constantly compounded, I think it takes away the fuel and the gas from our team, and we’ve got to be tougher than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve also got to be more responsible than that. All of us, coaches and players, have to do a much better job in terms of trying to help one another. I sensed the frustration [in the third quarter] and being deflated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there was one positive, it was a career-high 32 points for forward Matas Buzelis. But that’s where it ended for the Bulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for White, his hope is to stay healthy, get his hometown team to the postseason and worry about his contract and future in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[The Hornets’ front office] did some podcasts saying they want me to be a Hornet for a long time,” he said. “I don’t think they would have said it if they didn’t mean it. Obviously, I want to be a Hornet for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obviously, I’m in a very great situation with a really good team that has talent, really good players, good coaches, and they’re building something special here. Like I always say, I just want to be a small part of it and try and help any way I can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding his old team, he doesn’t look back negatively at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The basketball was always basketball,” White said. “That’s what I did, but I think the people here that I met [and] built relationships with was the thing that was the hardest for me [to leave]. You get used to seeing these people every day, but now you don’t.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The Rockets lost five of their final eight regular season games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But coach Brett Porto has a young, energetic team with a short memory and the atmosphere on Tuesday at Rocket Hill for the Class 3A regional semifinal game against Geneva was tingling with postseason electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans can make a difference, maybe more so in high school basketball than at any other level. Burlington Central’s players felt the energy from the student section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was amazing,” junior guard Ryan Carpenter said. “Home game, playoffs and we got the win.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rockets beat Geneva 62-58, holding on to win after giving away an 11-point lead in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is kind of us,” Porto said. “We give up leads. But I told them to just relax and get to the fourth quarter, and we would be right there. They did a really good job of staying poised with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carpenter is just 5-11, but he was the game’s leading rebounder with nine boards. He scored 14 points and had three crucial assists in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When [Carpenter] is aggressive, we are a much better team,” Porto said. “When he gets downhill, good things happen on offense. He’s played with toughness like that on the defensive end his whole career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rockets (19-12) start four juniors and 6-6 freshman Declan Wilson. Guard Bennek Braden led with 19 points and four rebounds, and 6-6 forward Patrick Magan added 11 points. Guard Joseph Cumpata scored eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson is an intriguing college prospect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s been really good for us this year, and he’s going to be a special player,” Porto said. “He’s skilled and not done growing. He’s had a lot of double-doubles for us. We’ve learned to trust him and play through him at different moments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson finished with 10 points and eight rebounds and shot 5-for-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was passive and nervous at the start of the season,” Wilson said. “Now I’m more comfortable with my teammates and I’ve learned my role as a player.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-840000\" name=\"image-840000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/602e731/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5746x3225+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F19%2F8abfac1f43c0aa7f7712de230834%2Fgeneva-burlington-central-boys-bbk-23.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b0c943c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5746x3225+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F19%2F8abfac1f43c0aa7f7712de230834%2Fgeneva-burlington-central-boys-bbk-23.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ec02b70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5746x3225+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F19%2F8abfac1f43c0aa7f7712de230834%2Fgeneva-burlington-central-boys-bbk-23.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Burlington Central forward Declan Wilson (13) clears the ball past Geneva guard Dane Turner (0), Geneva point guard Gabe Jensen (2) and Geneva guard Nathan Palmer (3).\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ec02b70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5746x3225+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F19%2F8abfac1f43c0aa7f7712de230834%2Fgeneva-burlington-central-boys-bbk-23.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac57b20/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5746x3225+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F19%2F8abfac1f43c0aa7f7712de230834%2Fgeneva-burlington-central-boys-bbk-23.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ec02b70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5746x3225+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F19%2F8abfac1f43c0aa7f7712de230834%2Fgeneva-burlington-central-boys-bbk-23.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burlington Central forward Declan Wilson (13) clears the ball past Geneva guard Dane Turner (0), Geneva point guard Gabe Jensen (2) and Geneva guard Nathan Palmer (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talia Sprague/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burlington Central led 29-18 at halftime.

That was by far our best game of the year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior guard David Udoiwood led the Vikings with 24 points. He fouled out with 1:54 left and Geneva trailing 56-50. Senior guard Nathan Palmer added 18 points for the Vikings, who were outrebounded 29-23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our seven losses we really struggled to rebound,” Geneva coach Scott Hennig said. “Part of it is a technique thing and part is a toughness thing.

Ilan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., both shouted at Trump from their seats, as Trump talked about illegal immigration and doubled down on attacking so-called Democratic sanctuary cities, including Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm also asking you to end deadly sanctuary cities that protect the criminals and enact serious penalties for public officials who block the removal of criminal aliens, in many cases, drug lords, murderers all over our country,” Trump said. “They're blocking the removal of these people out of our country, and you should be ashamed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And despite taking steps to restrict those coming into the U.S., often in the name of protecting national security, Trump spoke about letting people into the country \"legally.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We will always allow people to come in legally,\" Trump said. \"People that will love our country and will work hard to maintain our country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s comments about his immigration enforcements came as U.S. Rep.

Lauren Underwood, a Democrat from Naperville,  left the chamber during Trump’s speech. Underwood shook her head as she stood up to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Democrat waved goodbye to some of her Democratic women colleagues. The women, who were each wearing white as an homage to the suffragist movement, exchanged chuckles before Underwood quietly darted out the back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So did Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, who was escorted by security after holding up a sign that read “Black people aren’t apes,” which was grabbed by House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. That was in reference to Trump earlier this month sharing a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2026/02/06/donald-trump-racist-video-barack-michelle-obama-depiction-primates\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;racist video&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that includes a depiction of former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Tammy Duckworth, along with U.S. Reps. Mike Quigley, Sean Casten, Delia Ramirez, Jan Schakowsky and Eric Sorensen, boycotted the annual address, with Duckworth on Monday calling it “another campaign rally full of lies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Angel mom\" Jacqueline Medina was one of many guests Trump brought to the address. Medina's daughter Lizbeth was allegedly murdered by a Mexican man who lacked legal status in December 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Her heartbroken mother is in the gallery to remind everyone in this chamber exactly why we are deporting illegal alien criminals in our country at record numbers,\" Trump said to GOP applause. \"And we're getting them the hell out of here fast.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the political rhetoric, Trump tried to paint a rosy picture of his first year accomplishments — and poor approval ratings — ahead of November's midterm elections. The president lauded widespread tariffs and lamented the U.S. Supreme Court decision which struck them down as \"unfortunate,\" the camera panning to U.S. Supreme Court justices in the chamber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's saving our country,” Trump said of tariffs, while also calling them \"peace-protecting.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president brought out the Olympic gold medal-winning U.S men's hockey team into the House chamber to applause — and announced he would award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the team's goaltender, Connor Hellebuyck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump received a rare ovation from some Democrats, including from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., when he said he wanted Congress to pass a measure to stop insider stock trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s also ensure that members of Congress cannot corruptly profit from using insider information,” Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he noticed Democrats standing he called out, \"Did Nancy Pelosi stand up?\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contributing: AP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

That level of futility guarantees disillusionment and hostility from any knowledgeable fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having been in Chicago since 1973 [as a pitcher] with the White Sox, they’re one of the most educated fan bases around,” Stone told the Sun-Times. “Some people don’t like it that they boo or don’t show up in a losing streak, but the fan can express his feelings as he wants. There’s nothing wrong with booing. If you’re going to be in line for the cheers, you have to be for the boos. The fans know what is good baseball and what is bad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinsdorf has seen good and bad both on and off the field since he arrived on the scene in 1981. Much of the booing in the last three years has been directed at him, but Stone, having seen the Sox turn enough corners on the field in the second half of last season, suggests that will quiet down. He expects more cheerful results in 2026 and is bullish about general manager Chris Getz’s road map for success — Getz’s embarrassingly incorrect description of newly acquired Luisangel Acuna as a switch-hitter notwithstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fans saw we didn’t have a lot of offense, and the pitching was spotty in the first half, but the team showed in the second half that the rebuilding of Chris Getz and his front office is finally showing dividends — a structure of a pretty competent baseball team,” Stone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other reasons for optimism: rookie shortstop Colson Montgomery’s power stroke and defense, the Sox’ young catching depth and — on paper — an improved bullpen with free-agent acquisition Seranthony Dominguez and added power from Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A return to respectability seems possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not saying print the playoff tickets, but to judge a general manager is to look at who he has surrounded himself with,” Stone said, referring to assistant GMs Josh Barfield, Jin Wong and Carlos Rodriguez, pitching director Brian Bannister and player personnel director Gene Watson. Barfield will be a general manager one day, Stone predicted, and Rodriguez “worked with a successful Rays organization for 16 years, looked at everything going on here and said ‘I’d like to be there.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The front office right now is the strongest we’ve had in a long time,” Stone said. “Chris has done a great job reconfiguring it with a lot of guys from various places who can blend their experience to reformulate the White Sox organization. That part is exciting to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s spring training, a time when everyone is excited, including Stone, who’s entering the second year of a five-year contract in the TV broadcast booth, as well as his third year with play-by-play voice John Schriffen. Stone’s deal came courtesy of Reinsdorf, so his glass-half-full portrayal of the Sox’ operations is no shocker. That said, Stone is not the only one envisioning better days ahead, perhaps before billionaire private equity investor Justin Ishbia takes ownership of the Sox in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Reinsdorf remains respected by those who work for him. They also know his disdain for birthday mentions, so expect no fanfare Wednesday at Camelback Ranch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s one of those guys who, if he tells you something, you don’t have to wonder if it’s the truth,” Stone said. “He’s incredibly loyal and respects loyalty, which is lost in this new society. A lot of the younger people don’t understand loyalty, nor do they care about it much. That’s a problem. Not a problem that Jerry has, though.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
