His tongue hung out of an easy grin, in an expression that captured his youthful confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story accompanying it was a glowing profile that contrasted Crow-Armstrong’s rising stardom with his harsh self-criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it dropped on Monday, however, one quote in particular ignited a fiery reaction on social media: “I love Chicago more and more. It’s just an incredible city. The people are great. They give a shit. They aren’t just baseball fans who go to the game like Dodgers fans to take pictures and whatever. They are paying attention. They care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggregators pulled Crow-Armstrong’s words out of the story and dropped them onto graphics devoid of context. Dodgers fans’ reactions added fuel to the blaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s what happens when a player reaches &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/05/03/cubs-pete-crow-armstrong-on-offensive-tear-with-permission-to-be-himself-be-a-star\"   &gt;celebrity status&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a magnetic personality and emotion-forward playing style, Crow-Armstrong is caught in the awkward push and pull of a young career under intense magnification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An MVP-level first half last year thrust Crow-Armstrong, a former first-round pick, into an even brighter spotlight. But while his gold glove defense held steady, he struggled at the plate down the stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong – acquired as a prospect in the 2021 trade that sent Javy Báez to the Mets – has won Cubs fans’ affections. But for fans outside of Chicago, the player himself can be as polarizing as his 2025 offensive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of just who Pete is and because of his talents, I think there’s always going to be very high expectations,” manager Craig Counsell said Tuesday. “That’s the blessing and the curse of being very talented, right? And that’s OK. And I think Pete understands that better than we give him credit for. He understands that very, very well. And I think he handles it very, very well. That’s part of it. You’re going to talk about people like that a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talk isn’t just about overall performance. It’s also the superhuman catch he pulled off in the outfield, or the helmet he cracked in a moment of frustration, or the blue stars he dyed into his hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrity is rarer to achieve in baseball than other sports. The game doesn't lend itself to fame the same way. There’s no guarantee that the best player on their field will end up with the ball or a bat in his hand in the biggest moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exceptions include the Dodgers’ Shohei Ohtani, one of the biggest sports stars in the world. But most baseball players can maneuver about their lives in relative anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong is no Ohtani, but he's definitely not anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, a fragment of a quote critical of his hometown fanbase would cause a stir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong declined to comment on the Chicago Magazine piece Tuesday. But he’s leaned into banter with Dodgers fans in recent years, trading harmless jabs during trips to Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love playing here,” &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/04/14/cubs-pete-crow-armstrong-breaks-out-of-slow-start-in-big-way\"   &gt;Crow-Armstrong said at Dodger Stadium last April&lt;/a&gt;, after hitting two home runs in a game that clinched a series win. “It’s a fun crowd, and I like the noise. I think the Cubbies like playing here, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He paused for effect, a half smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong has an eye-popping 1.028 OPS at Dodger Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He grew up in Los Angeles and attended Harvard-Westlake High School. When he was young, Crow-Armstrong tied his fandom to specific players rather than teams. But eventually his Naperville-native dad, Matthew John Armstrong, convinced Crow-Armstrong to join the Cubs faithful. He especially had an affinity for Báez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a twist of fate that Báez’ trade would put Crow-Armstrong on track to become a Cubs star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong’s schedule Tuesday was packed with sponsorship and TV duties. But when he stepped off MLB Network’s temporary set at the Cubs’ spring training complex, he spotted a kid holding a sign that read, “PCA is my hero,” and beelined to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chatting about the Javy Báez baseball card the young fan handed him – the boy explained, “You’re my favorite player, and I know your favorite player is Javy.” – Crow-Armstrong was in his element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrity brings wholesome moments, too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

It took awhile, but at 9:18 p.m. ET Trump made his first mention of former President Joe Biden, saying he was the worst. He lobbed another dart  at Biden at 9:19 p.m. ET. &lt;i&gt;Update posted 8:35 p.m. CT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chamber stands for USA men’s hockey team in moment of rare unity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump introduced the men's gold medal team and talked hockey for a bit. The team entered the chamber through the House Press Gallery that is above the podium, where the reporters on deadline work. The USA women's hockey team, Trump said, will be coming to the White House. Don't know when. Democrats and Republicans applauded the team.

Trump called the court 6-3 ruling striking down his tariffs as \"very unfortunate\" and then challenged their power, claiming he had the \"legal power\" to do what he wanted in keeping up the tariffs. Also said \"congressional action\" was not necessary. In a chamber with members from all three branches of government, Trump said that he was the only one with tariff power. Barrett stared hard at the president, but hers was not a poker face. Her stare spoke volumes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump also said tariffs are paid for by foreign nations. Tariffs are paid for by U.S. based companies bringing in the goods, with high costs often &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-midsized-companies-costs-consumers-2a25158ff1d06bd7f72d909a8ec64f25\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;passed on to consumers&lt;/a&gt;, recent report finds. &lt;i&gt;Update posted 9:10 p.m. CT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’m watching for:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will he mention Chicago?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s first year had a profound impact in Chicago and the state of Illinois. Among the Chicago-related things that could come up: insults aimed at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/illinois-governor\"   &gt;Gov. JB Pritzker&lt;/a&gt; and Mayor Brandon Johnson; the Trump administration's Chicago deportation campaign and the cost of the Obama Presidential Center, a more frequent Trump target as the center gets ready to open later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will this be a speech to all Americans or to Trump’s MAGA base?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s go-to place is to play to his base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What about Iran?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Trump offer some guiding principles for attacking Iran and tell Congress — to their faces — they have no say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What about pocketbook issues?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a good bet that Trump will claim everything is cheaper. Please refer to your personal experiences and wallet when Trump almost certainly brings this up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Immigration likely to be major talking point&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What will Trump say about the deaths in Minneapolis? How will he defend ICE and Border Patrol?&lt;/p&gt;",

According to Donovan, Simons actually has an existing fracture in the hand that he’s been dealing with since training camp with the Celtics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specialist said it did not require surgery unless it worsens or persists, so the hope is to have the guard back sooner than later. That’s the hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He did have some difficulty in Boston with it in training camp and missed a little bit of time, maybe 10 days with it,” Donovan said. “The fracture hasn’t quite healed and I think him seeing a hand specialist they decided that once the pain subsides, he’s fine to go back to play. I don’t know how long that’s going to be. If I go off the last time it happened to him in Boston it was a week-to-10 days. That’s where it’s at. I don’t know what will happen at the end of the year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit tricker with Ivey. The former Piston suffered a broken fibula last season in Detroit, missed the remainder of the season and returned this year. He did not return the same explosive Ivey he was out of Purdue, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was obvious in his first four games with the Bulls, and beyond concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We started him on a program, right now just to ramp him up physically,” Donovan said. “A lot of it has been to get the strength back in around his knee. That process started a couple days ago, so he’s in the midst of doing that. Talking to the medical guys it’s going to be pretty intense for him, the program to get the strength back as quickly as possible, so he’s going to have to really work hard on that part of it. I think he feels better not playing, the pain has subsided, but the biggest concern the medical guys have is his strength. That his quad is firing, he can cut and move, be the athlete that he’s been.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds good, but there are only 24 games left and each day the runway gets a bit shorter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coby White had a lot to say in his return to the United Center with Charlotte, and a lot of it centered around how important Donovan was for his development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I give him a lot of credit for how far I came,” White said. “When you’re a young player he is very hard on you. It’s a lot of tough love, but it’s because he sees something in you and he’s from New York, he’s battle-tested, so that’s his way to kind of see how tough you are. Can you respond?

And pitchers’ velocities generally increase through the spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I want to preface by saying, for me, velo isn’t everything,’’ Imanaga said through an interpreter. ‘‘But having velocity obviously is an advantage. Today, [I] felt like the velo was up. So just overall, my takeaway was that it was a good start.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imanaga isn’t a power pitcher by any means, but he was slow to regain velocity last season after suffering a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/10/06/how-shota-imanagas-throwing-philosopher-side-came-out-post-injury-nlds-brewers-game-2\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;strained hamstring in May&lt;/a&gt;. His fastball averaged 90.8 mph in 2025, compared with 91.7 the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a subtle difference, but when Imanaga’s fastball velocity is up, it creates more separation from his splitter, which is his go-to secondary pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I was really happy with how he left [last season],’’ manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell&lt;/b&gt; said, regardless of Imanaga’s struggles down the stretch and into the playoffs. ‘‘Very confident that he would put himself in a very good position, and he was ready to do that.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Imanaga allowed three hits in 2‰ scoreless innings against the Padres. The hardest pitch he threw was a 94.1 mph heater on the outside corner to strike out infielder &lt;b&gt;Sung-Mun Song&lt;/b&gt; swinging in the first inning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Long still eyeing WBC&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First baseman &lt;b&gt;Jonathon Long&lt;/b&gt; moved his flight date to join Team Chinese Taipei from Tuesday to Friday, Counsell said. His recovery since &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/21/how-tokyo-series-prepared-cubs-matthew-boyd-for-wbc-ramp-up\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;spraining his left elbow in an in-game collision Saturday&lt;/a&gt; has been promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘He’s doing much better,’’ Counsell said. ‘‘No issue with X-rays or anything like that. The soreness is dissipating. Still a little residual soreness, but it’s the kind that’s improving every day.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long took swings Tuesday, Counsell said, and he’ll ramp up his activity in the next couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘He doesn’t really want to get on a plane and have some question about his availability,’’ Counsell said. ‘‘He’s trending well.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conforto in camp&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outfielder &lt;b&gt;Michael Conforto&lt;/b&gt; joined the team workout Tuesday, running through defensive drills on the back fields with a couple of new teammates before taking batting practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs declined to make him available to the media because &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/23/cubs-signing-outfielder-michael-conforto-to-minor-league-deal\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;his minor-league deal&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t official yet, but he sat down with Counsell earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I thought Michael laid it out really well, where he’s at,’’ Counsell said. ‘‘He’s in a good place. You learn from all your experiences, [and it] puts you in a good place. You have uncertainty when you come to camp on a non-roster deal, and I think he’s in a position to use that uncertainty in a really good way.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counsell said he expects to get Conforto into the lineup Sunday, giving him four days of camp to build up.&lt;/p&gt;",

The building is clad in light blue glazed brick — a rare color choice for a house of worship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with its classical proportions, but modern, almost proto-Art Deco detailing, the church somehow managed to be classic and contemporary for its time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-8e0000\" name=\"image-8e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/13cc824/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/41171cd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/471cbcf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Architectural detail of a cross in the brick structure of the Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/471cbcf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5b1c74a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/471cbcf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2Fb2%2Ff72261ec4c64abf947371ed2fed4%2Fmetro-260225-27.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the architectural details on the north face of the Metropolitan Missionary Baptist Church&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The church was designated a Chicago landmark in 1989 and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan Missionary Baptist congregation bought the building in 1947. And in 1953, the church caught the attention of Life magazine and its famed photographer Gordon Parks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parks' &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.gordonparksfoundation.org/education/features/the-great-home-in-the-wilderness\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;black-and-white images&lt;/a&gt; documented baptisms, prayer, smiling children in their Sunday finest and the large congregation worshiping inside Metropolitan's glorious sanctuary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oddly enough, the magazine ended up not publishing Parks' photos or the accompanying story he wrote. But the emphatic images ended up finding a life of their own and wound up being widely seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Gordon Parks Foundation, in the photographer's unpublished manuscript, he called Metropolitan \"a temple of hope to thousands of Negro people caught in the backyard of this vast city. It is a haven in a world of unending trouble.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund grants were awarded a month after the group handed out &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://savingplaces.org/press-center/media-resources/action-fund-5m-mlk-pbc-grants-2026\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;$5 million&lt;/a&gt; in grants to five historic Black churches on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The churches included Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ, 4021 S.

But it’s still trying to “crack the code” outside of its home market with people unfamiliar with the brand, Miles said during its Tuesday earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company underscored smaller-format new restaurants to help lower costs. In fiscal year 2025, food, beverage and packaging costs rose 4.1% due to inflation, including higher commodity prices for beef and pork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue for fiscal year 2025, ended Dec. 28, rose 3% year-over-year to $732.1 million, due primarily to recent restaurant openings. But same-restaurant sales, or those open for at least 24 months, fell 0.5%. Net income was $21.1 million, compared to more than $35 million in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fourth quarter 2025, revenue was $185.7 million, compared to $184.6 million the previous year. Net income fell more than 49% to nearly $6.3 million, compared to $12.4 million in fourth quarter 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dick Portillo founded Portillo’s in 1963 in Villa Park. It has since grown from a small hot dog trailer to more than 100 restaurants across 11 states. Last year, the company launched eight restaurants in Texas, Georgia, Florida, Arizona and Plainfield.&lt;/p&gt;",

Sources say Cortopassi was laid off in the middle of his shift, leaving Micah Materre to work solo on the anchor desk Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The layoffs follow a recent round of behind-the-scenes cuts that included copywriters, circumstances that have touched local network affiliates but rarely have hit “Chicago’s Very Own.” One veteran TV reporter had never seen this many cuts at once from a Chicago station. They come as WGN parent company Nexstar is working to merge with Tegna in a deal that’s under regulatory review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Nexstar spokesperson said in a statement to the Sun-Times: “Nexstar does not comment on personnel issues, but the company is taking steps necessary to compete effectively in this period of unprecedented change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts shook up WGN's anchor schedule. According to sources, Patrick Elwood will anchor solo at noon, Lourdes Duarte will do the same at 4 p.m., Ben Bradley will join Duarte at 5 and Micah Materre will join Bradley at 6. Materre also will anchor solo from 9 to 10:30. The popular morning-news crew is expected to stay intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the talents let go are nationally known from WGN's days as a superstation, when its programming beamed via cable and satellite across the country. Richards joined WGN in 1991 as a staff announcer and became a regular contributor in 1998. Crews has covered the city and state since 1996. Boden has covered sports for more than 30 years at a half-dozen Chicago TV and radio stations. Wang began at the defunct CLTV in 1995 before joining WGN in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The layoffs are an apparent effort to cut costs in anticipation of the excessive debt Nexstar will incur from money borrowed to buy Tegna. In August, Nexstar announced it would acquire Tegna for $6.2 billion, creating a broadcast behemoth that would cover about 80% of U.S. TV households. The deal requires the Federal Communications Commission to lift its 39% ownership cap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WGN is still very profitable, despite changes in viewing habits, but the cuts have to come from somewhere, through no fault of the employees affected. Nexstar already has been carrying the debt from its $4.1 billion purchase of Tribune Media in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratings-wise, WGN News performs great in the morning, dominates Fox 32 at 9 p.m. and is competitive at 10. Its morning-news show is emulated by other stations in the country.&lt;/p&gt;",

Fahy said she hadn’t ever banked in one three, let alone two, in a game before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it didn’t matter because they were important,” said Fahy, who scored 17 points in Maine South’s 55-48 win over Lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks’ 4A sectional semifinal win showed the team’s relentlessness. They trailed by as many as 12 points in the first half but trimmed the deficit to seven at halftime. That’s when the Hawks knew they had to make a change to complete the comeback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We just, like, needed to relax,” Fahy said. “ Like we were all too razzled, it’s the playoffs. Everyone's excited. [Coach Jeff Haman] was like, ‘You guys need to relax and rebound.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pep talk paid off as the Hawks surged out of halftime with a renewed sense of urgency. They boxed out, did a better job of defending Lane’s backdoor cuts, and got into more of a flow offensively. Fahy, junior guard Phoebe O’Shea and junior forward Evelina Sotos all hit a three in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a different fervor from the Hawks in the third quarter. They weren’t going to be deterred from completing the comeback. On one play, Sotos ran to the right corner and corralled a loose ball to give Maine South an extra possession. The ball eventually swung back to Sotos, and she drilled a three-pointer. Senior guard Gianna LaVecchia knocked down two free throws at the end of the third quarter to give Maine South its first lead since the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are resilient, tough, and a group that loves each other,” Hamann said. “When you have that love for each other … [combined with] the toughness and the resiliency, we can do some great things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lane was very impressive on Tuesday. The Champions were active on the glass and held a lead for the majority of the game. But foul trouble and double-digit turnovers plagued the Champions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All the credit goes to Lane,” Hamann said. “They're young, and they're good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks are a team that uses the majority of their roster. It’s not uncommon for the Hawks to play 10 players in a game. Fahy’s points were huge, but O’Shea’s 13 points were also critical off the bench. She had some tough drives to the basket to either convert at the basket or draw a foul. She’s also a knockdown shooter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She's amazing off the bench,” Fahy said of O’Shea. “She's like a hidden weapon. When [opposing players] come down the court, people are like, ‘Oh, shoot.’ She's always ready for those moments, and she knows her role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Maine South’s win, its fan base stormed the court to celebrate with the Hawks. This was a confidence-boosting win for the Hawks going into the 4A sectional championship against Loyola on Thursday at Maine South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm really proud of them [that] in a game that we weren't at our best and things weren't flowing the way we wanted to, we still found a way in a state playoff game in this atmosphere,” Haman said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

I hold myself to really high standards, and it was not what I expected or wanted. But I had a really good offseason and am prepared for better things this season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said his “ups and downs” taught him a lot about himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You keep going through it and grinding every day, stick to your routine and hammer it out,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After extending his season in the fall league (14 innings, 2.57 ERA, 21 strikeouts, six walks), Smith finds himself ramping up behind many of the other pitchers in camp. He threw 23 pitches in his first live batting practice Tuesday at Camelback Ranch and expects his first game action March 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and &lt;b&gt;Noah Schultz&lt;/b&gt;, another lefty drafted in the first round (2022), are expected to open the season at Triple-A Charlotte but could debut with the big-league team by midseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Put Mune on the board&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Munetaka Murakami’s&lt;/b&gt; attempt at a &lt;b&gt;Hawk Harrelson&lt;/b&gt; home-run call on camera was the latest example of the Japanese slugger’s fun side, which should make him a fan favorite in his first MLB season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He certainly takes it seriously, like all these guys do,” manager &lt;b&gt;Will Venable &lt;/b&gt;said. “When it’s time to play baseball, he’s very serious. But there is definitely a lighter side to Mune. He’s got a big personality, funny dude, and definitely likes to joke around with the guys. Time and place for everything, but he’s doing a great job being locked in on the field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami, an infielder, signed a two-year, $34 million deal in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Manager’s corner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venable said shortstop &lt;b&gt;Colson Montgomery&lt;/b&gt;, who was out for a second day Tuesday with an unspecified illness, was feeling a little bit better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’’ll see where he’s at [Wednesday],” Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• There’s no estimate yet on when center fielder &lt;b&gt;Everson Pereira&lt;/b&gt;, acquired in an offseason trade with the Rays, will return to game action after experiencing tightness in his right side, Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Especially with that side stuff, you just don’t want to mess around and turn it into a longer stint than it needs to be,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Versatile infielder &lt;b&gt;Tanner Murray&lt;/b&gt;, acquired for right-handers &lt;b&gt;Steven Wilson&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Yoendrys Gomez &lt;/b&gt;in the same trade that brought Pereira, played in his third game at shortstop and drove in three runs with a homer and a double.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;b&gt;Lenyn Sosa&lt;/b&gt; started at third base, where he played 54 games in 2024 but only 18 last season. Sosa, who had 22 homers and 75 RBI in 2025, is no Gold Glover but needs to be available at second, first and third to ensure his share of at-bats, Venable said. He singled and doubled in four plate appearances Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sox 12, Mariners 10&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a second-tier lineup, the Sox (4-1) cranked out 16 hits in a 3-hour, 48-minute game in Peoria, hiking their spring total to 60 hits. &lt;b&gt;Brooks Baldwin&lt;/b&gt; (double, two singles) led the way with three hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Left-hander &lt;b&gt;Anthony Kay&lt;/b&gt;, one of three pitchers, along with &lt;b&gt;Shane Smith &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Davis Martin&lt;/b&gt;, who have all-but guaranteed rotation spots, allowed one run, one hit and two walks over two innings in his first spring start. Signed as a free agent after ERAs of 1.74 and 1.54 his last two seasons in Japan, Kay said he was initially over-amped as he made his first start in a major-league uniform since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Righty &lt;b&gt;Wikelman Gonzalez&lt;/b&gt;, one of the prospects acquired in the &lt;b&gt;Garrett Crochet&lt;/b&gt; trade, walked two and gave up three hits, including &lt;b&gt;Cal Raleigh’s&lt;/b&gt; first spring homer, in his one inning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The Sox turned a pair of double plays but surrendered a run on catcher &lt;b&gt;Edgar Quero’s&lt;/b&gt; way-high throw to third base on a rundown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;b&gt;On deck: &lt;/b&gt;Reds at Sox, 2:05 p.m. Wednesday, Glendale, &lt;b&gt;Nick Lodolo &lt;/b&gt;vs. &lt;b&gt;Davis Martin&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",

Meanwhile, White’s former team (24-35) has lost 10 straight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way the season was going, we really weren’t stacking enough wins consistently, so like I always said from the jump, I support whatever they think is best for the team,” White said of the Bulls’ decision to move him. “This organization believed in me. They gave me a chance and an opportunity to live out my dreams. So I just want to see the organization succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might not be for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing in his first game since the trade, White was recovered enough from a strained calf to get 16 minutes off the bench, scoring 10 points on 4-for-9 shooting. Not that the Hornets needed much from him. They outscored the Bulls 42-16 in the third quarter, including getting 17 points off 10 Bulls turnovers. They also had 14 fast break points in the quarter and 12 assists to the Bulls’ two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The turnovers are a problem — they are a major problem, and we have to continue to get that resolved,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “When there are mistakes that are made and they are constantly compounded, I think it takes away the fuel and the gas from our team, and we’ve got to be tougher than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve also got to be more responsible than that. All of us, coaches and players, have to do a much better job in terms of trying to help one another. I sensed the frustration [in the third quarter] and being deflated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there was one positive, it was a career-high 32 points for forward Matas Buzelis. But that’s where it ended for the Bulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for White, his hope is to stay healthy, get his hometown team to the postseason and worry about his contract and future in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[The Hornets’ front office] did some podcasts saying they want me to be a Hornet for a long time,” he said. “I don’t think they would have said it if they didn’t mean it. Obviously, I want to be a Hornet for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obviously, I’m in a very great situation with a really good team that has talent, really good players, good coaches, and they’re building something special here. Like I always say, I just want to be a small part of it and try and help any way I can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding his old team, he doesn’t look back negatively at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The basketball was always basketball,” White said. “That’s what I did, but I think the people here that I met [and] built relationships with was the thing that was the hardest for me [to leave]. You get used to seeing these people every day, but now you don’t.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The Rockets lost five of their final eight regular season games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But coach Brett Porto has a young, energetic team with a short memory and the atmosphere on Tuesday at Rocket Hill for the Class 3A regional semifinal game against Geneva was tingling with postseason electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans can make a difference, maybe more so in high school basketball than at any other level. Burlington Central’s players felt the energy from the student section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was amazing,” junior guard Ryan Carpenter said. “Home game, playoffs and we got the win.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rockets beat Geneva 62-58, holding on to win after giving away an 11-point lead in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is kind of us,” Porto said. “We give up leads. But I told them to just relax and get to the fourth quarter, and we would be right there. They did a really good job of staying poised with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carpenter is just 5-11, but he was the game’s leading rebounder with nine boards. He scored 14 points and had three crucial assists in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When [Carpenter] is aggressive, we are a much better team,” Porto said. “When he gets downhill, good things happen on offense. He’s played with toughness like that on the defensive end his whole career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rockets (19-12) start four juniors and 6-6 freshman Declan Wilson. Guard Bennek Braden led with 19 points and four rebounds, and 6-6 forward Patrick Magan added 11 points. Guard Joseph Cumpata scored eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson is an intriguing college prospect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s been really good for us this year, and he’s going to be a special player,” Porto said. “He’s skilled and not done growing. He’s had a lot of double-doubles for us. We’ve learned to trust him and play through him at different moments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson finished with 10 points and eight rebounds and shot 5-for-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was passive and nervous at the start of the season,” Wilson said. “Now I’m more comfortable with my teammates and I’ve learned my role as a player.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-840000\" name=\"image-840000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/602e731/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5746x3225+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F19%2F8abfac1f43c0aa7f7712de230834%2Fgeneva-burlington-central-boys-bbk-23.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b0c943c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5746x3225+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F19%2F8abfac1f43c0aa7f7712de230834%2Fgeneva-burlington-central-boys-bbk-23.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ec02b70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5746x3225+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F19%2F8abfac1f43c0aa7f7712de230834%2Fgeneva-burlington-central-boys-bbk-23.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Burlington Central forward Declan Wilson (13) clears the ball past Geneva guard Dane Turner (0), Geneva point guard Gabe Jensen (2) and Geneva guard Nathan Palmer (3).\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ec02b70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5746x3225+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F19%2F8abfac1f43c0aa7f7712de230834%2Fgeneva-burlington-central-boys-bbk-23.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac57b20/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5746x3225+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F19%2F8abfac1f43c0aa7f7712de230834%2Fgeneva-burlington-central-boys-bbk-23.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ec02b70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5746x3225+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F19%2F8abfac1f43c0aa7f7712de230834%2Fgeneva-burlington-central-boys-bbk-23.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burlington Central forward Declan Wilson (13) clears the ball past Geneva guard Dane Turner (0), Geneva point guard Gabe Jensen (2) and Geneva guard Nathan Palmer (3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talia Sprague/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burlington Central led 29-18 at halftime.

That was by far our best game of the year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior guard David Udoiwood led the Vikings with 24 points. He fouled out with 1:54 left and Geneva trailing 56-50. Senior guard Nathan Palmer added 18 points for the Vikings, who were outrebounded 29-23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our seven losses we really struggled to rebound,” Geneva coach Scott Hennig said. “Part of it is a technique thing and part is a toughness thing.

Ilan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., both shouted at Trump from their seats, as Trump talked about illegal immigration and doubled down on attacking so-called Democratic sanctuary cities, including Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm also asking you to end deadly sanctuary cities that protect the criminals and enact serious penalties for public officials who block the removal of criminal aliens, in many cases, drug lords, murderers all over our country,” Trump said. “They're blocking the removal of these people out of our country, and you should be ashamed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And despite taking steps to restrict those coming into the U.S., often in the name of protecting national security, Trump spoke about letting people into the country \"legally.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We will always allow people to come in legally,\" Trump said. \"People that will love our country and will work hard to maintain our country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s comments about his immigration enforcements came as U.S. Rep.

Lauren Underwood, a Democrat from Naperville,  left the chamber during Trump’s speech. Underwood shook her head as she stood up to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Democrat waved goodbye to some of her Democratic women colleagues. The women, who were each wearing white as an homage to the suffragist movement, exchanged chuckles before Underwood quietly darted out the back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So did Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, who was escorted by security after holding up a sign that read “Black people aren’t apes,” which was grabbed by House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. That was in reference to Trump earlier this month sharing a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2026/02/06/donald-trump-racist-video-barack-michelle-obama-depiction-primates\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;racist video&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that includes a depiction of former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama as apes in a jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Tammy Duckworth, along with U.S. Reps. Mike Quigley, Sean Casten, Delia Ramirez, Jan Schakowsky and Eric Sorensen, boycotted the annual address, with Duckworth on Monday calling it “another campaign rally full of lies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Angel mom\" Jacqueline Medina was one of many guests Trump brought to the address. Medina's daughter Lizbeth was allegedly murdered by a Mexican man who lacked legal status in December 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Her heartbroken mother is in the gallery to remind everyone in this chamber exactly why we are deporting illegal alien criminals in our country at record numbers,\" Trump said to GOP applause. \"And we're getting them the hell out of here fast.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the political rhetoric, Trump tried to paint a rosy picture of his first year accomplishments — and poor approval ratings — ahead of November's midterm elections. The president lauded widespread tariffs and lamented the U.S. Supreme Court decision which struck them down as \"unfortunate,\" the camera panning to U.S. Supreme Court justices in the chamber. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's saving our country,” Trump said of tariffs, while also calling them \"peace-protecting.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The president brought out the Olympic gold medal-winning U.S men's hockey team into the House chamber to applause — and announced he would award the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the team's goaltender, Connor Hellebuyck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump received a rare ovation from some Democrats, including from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., when he said he wanted Congress to pass a measure to stop insider stock trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Let’s also ensure that members of Congress cannot corruptly profit from using insider information,” Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he noticed Democrats standing he called out, \"Did Nancy Pelosi stand up?\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contributing: AP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

That level of futility guarantees disillusionment and hostility from any knowledgeable fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having been in Chicago since 1973 [as a pitcher] with the White Sox, they’re one of the most educated fan bases around,” Stone told the Sun-Times. “Some people don’t like it that they boo or don’t show up in a losing streak, but the fan can express his feelings as he wants. There’s nothing wrong with booing. If you’re going to be in line for the cheers, you have to be for the boos. The fans know what is good baseball and what is bad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinsdorf has seen good and bad both on and off the field since he arrived on the scene in 1981. Much of the booing in the last three years has been directed at him, but Stone, having seen the Sox turn enough corners on the field in the second half of last season, suggests that will quiet down. He expects more cheerful results in 2026 and is bullish about general manager Chris Getz’s road map for success — Getz’s embarrassingly incorrect description of newly acquired Luisangel Acuna as a switch-hitter notwithstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fans saw we didn’t have a lot of offense, and the pitching was spotty in the first half, but the team showed in the second half that the rebuilding of Chris Getz and his front office is finally showing dividends — a structure of a pretty competent baseball team,” Stone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other reasons for optimism: rookie shortstop Colson Montgomery’s power stroke and defense, the Sox’ young catching depth and — on paper — an improved bullpen with free-agent acquisition Seranthony Dominguez and added power from Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A return to respectability seems possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not saying print the playoff tickets, but to judge a general manager is to look at who he has surrounded himself with,” Stone said, referring to assistant GMs Josh Barfield, Jin Wong and Carlos Rodriguez, pitching director Brian Bannister and player personnel director Gene Watson. Barfield will be a general manager one day, Stone predicted, and Rodriguez “worked with a successful Rays organization for 16 years, looked at everything going on here and said ‘I’d like to be there.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The front office right now is the strongest we’ve had in a long time,” Stone said. “Chris has done a great job reconfiguring it with a lot of guys from various places who can blend their experience to reformulate the White Sox organization. That part is exciting to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s spring training, a time when everyone is excited, including Stone, who’s entering the second year of a five-year contract in the TV broadcast booth, as well as his third year with play-by-play voice John Schriffen. Stone’s deal came courtesy of Reinsdorf, so his glass-half-full portrayal of the Sox’ operations is no shocker. That said, Stone is not the only one envisioning better days ahead, perhaps before billionaire private equity investor Justin Ishbia takes ownership of the Sox in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Reinsdorf remains respected by those who work for him. They also know his disdain for birthday mentions, so expect no fanfare Wednesday at Camelback Ranch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s one of those guys who, if he tells you something, you don’t have to wonder if it’s the truth,” Stone said. “He’s incredibly loyal and respects loyalty, which is lost in this new society. A lot of the younger people don’t understand loyalty, nor do they care about it much. That’s a problem. Not a problem that Jerry has, though.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Brian Hopkins asks, \"Am I supposed to close all of the restaurants?\" he's presenting a false choice. I invite him to visit any city in Europe, where the streets with bike lanes (and even fully pedestrianized areas) are full of crowded, bustling restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I run three retail businesses in the city and am opening a fourth. We receive 40 to 50 deliveries a week and make  our own deliveries. I bike to work every day. Safely getting to work without being killed or maimed by a driver is a higher priority for me than making the deliveries slightly more convenient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know parking in the bike lane is dangerous, as it forces cyclists unexpectedly into fast-moving car traffic. That's why we have laws against it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can argue whether the citizen enforcement idea is good. We can argue about whether the bike lanes should be better designed. We can argue about whether there should be more loading zones. But we should not — we cannot — say the lives of pedestrians and cyclists are just the cost of doing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopkins should worry less about getting an \"angry phone call from Budweiser beer trucks and lobster companies\" and worry more about getting angry calls from bereaved parents and spouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steven Lucy, Hyde Park&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-840000\" name=\"module-840000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give us your take&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Send letters to the editor to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Why is U. of C. allowing this administration to define an outstanding program as \"discriminatory\"? Clearly, it is not. It is righting a long-standing wrong by allowing outstanding students with limited resources to have a chance to fulfill their potential, which benefits our country in myriad ways. Maybe one of those students will cure cancer or develop a viable system of fusion energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When our institutions fail, autocracy thrives.

Federal regulations are no different. For nearly two decades, the Environmental Protection Agency’s endangerment finding was the legal bedrock for limiting greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks. Recently, the Trump administration &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://e2.org/releases/epa-repeals-endangerment-finding-raises-costs-for-businesses-consumers/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;repealed the endangerment finding for greenhouse gas emissions and eliminated clean vehicle standards,&lt;/a&gt; delivering a potentially fatal blow to the foundation of our economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not just a fight for automakers or environmental groups. In the U.S., &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;vehicles are the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions&lt;/a&gt;; emissions that are already reshaping the built environment and shrinking our wallets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Helene caused &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5523815-hurricane-helene-asheville-western-north-carolina-recovers/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;nearly $80 billion in damage&lt;/a&gt; and killed more than 250 people.

The consequences reach far beyond the tailpipe, shaping broader market stability, supply chain reliability, the cost of capital and the resilience of the communities we’re all trying to build.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Milton Pinsky, chairman, Banner Real Estate Group LLC&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Name airport after Jackson &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coverage of the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/obituaries/2026/02/17/rev-jesse-jackson-civil-rights-leader-rainbow-push-obituary\"   &gt;Rev.

He has a friend, \"Byron,\" whom he hangs out with multiple times a week, sometimes up to six days. Byron's wife, \"Crystal,\" (married 22 years) is always attached to Byron's hip. They do everything together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crystal needs to be the center of attention. She constantly brags about herself and speaks louder so she gets all the attention. She's always texting my boyfriend, even sending him pictures of herself. My boyfriend says it's harmless and that there's nothing to be worried about because \"she's his friend's wife.\" To me, that means nothing. Crystal is very competitive, and I feel like she's trying to win him over. I'm about ready to let her win because I'm not a confrontational person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hang out with them often, so I can distract her and let my boyfriend talk to Byron without her. But I get so exhausted. It's nonstop. She's definitely going out of bounds, treating my boyfriend like her man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've mentioned my dislike of the situation but have been told it's my problem (I'm jealous), not his. My boyfriend says I'm acting too clingy now because I always want to be there to keep them separated, but it's wearing on me. Am I reading too much into this? — &lt;i&gt;ENCROACHED ON IN VERMONT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ENCROACHED:&lt;/b&gt; No, I think you have probably read Crystal, and her insatiable need for attention, right. Because trying to shield your boyfriend from her attempts to monopolize him hasn't worked, it may be time for a change in tactics. By that, I mean stop tagging along so often. Give him space, while you use the time to get together with friends, family or some other activity you enjoy. If you do, you and your boyfriend will have more to talk about when he returns from these marathons. As I see it, you have nothing to lose and possibly something to gain by trying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; I am in the process of leaving my husband of 15 years. He has admitted that he used to have sex with me while I was sleeping and when I was passed out drunk back when I had a drinking problem. He's aware that I was molested when I was younger and that most of it took place when I was sleeping and I would wake up to it happening. He doesn't see anything wrong with it. He says he was gentle and it was OK because I'm his wife and it's better than cheating on me. This has permanently scarred me. I don't know how to handle it. Please help. — &lt;i&gt;TRAUMATIZED IN NEW YORK&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR TRAUMATIZED:&lt;/b&gt; You have my sympathy. If you haven't sought counseling, I hope you will do it to help you process the fact that the assaults you have described were spousal rape. Sex with a person who is unable to give consent is illegal in all 50 states. For the sake of your mental health, please talk with a psychotherapist, who can help you to heal as well as report this to the police.

In spite of this, many legislators support the bill as a means of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://scalise.house.gov/press-releases/scalise-getting-the-save-america-act-to-president-trumps-desk-is-critical\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;eliminating noncitizen voting&lt;/a&gt; in elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a legal scholar who studies, among other things, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ssrn.com/abstract=5167136\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;foreign interference&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ssrn.com/abstract=5178898\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;in elections&lt;/a&gt;, I find considerations about the potential effects of the SAVE America Act important, especially given &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/2017_NoncitizenVoting_Final.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;how rare it is&lt;/a&gt; that a noncitizen actually votes in federal elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, it is equally crucial to consider a more fundamental question: Is the SAVE America Act even constitutional?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/7296\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;The SAVE America Act would forbid&lt;/a&gt; state election officials from registering an individual to vote in federal elections unless this person “provides documentary proof of United States citizenship.” Furthermore, it would forbid individuals from voting unless they bring such proof to the polls each time they vote, unless their state agrees to submit voter registration lists to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on a quarterly basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acceptable forms of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/real-id-faqs\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;proof for voter registration&lt;/a&gt; would include a REAL ID that demonstrates U.S. citizenship — most of which do not — &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/congress-save-act-citizenship-republicans-women-0c0ba9fd8e6a01cf144736490c71df21\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;as well as a U.S. passport&lt;/a&gt; or a U.S. military identification card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So — should the SAVE America Act become law — if a person turns 18 or moves between states and wishes to register to vote in federal elections in their new home, they would likely be turned away if they do not have any such documents readily available. At best, they could still fill out a registration form, but they would need to mail in acceptable proof of citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For married people with changed last names, among others, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://19thnews.org/2025/03/save-act-voting-married-women/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;questions remain&lt;/a&gt; about whether birth certificates could even count as acceptable proof of citizenship for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Constitution says little about voting rights&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the national conversation the SAVE America Act has sparked, it is unclear whether Congress even has the power to enact it. This is the key constitutional question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Constitution &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;imposes no citizenship requirement&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to voting. The original text of the Constitution, in fact, said very little about the right to vote. It was not until legislators passed &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.usa.gov/voting-rights\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;subsequent amendments&lt;/a&gt;, starting after the Civil War up through the 1970s, that the Constitution even explicitly prohibited voting laws that discriminate on account of race, sex or age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.usa.gov/voting-rights\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Aside from these amendments&lt;/a&gt;, the Constitution is largely silent about who gets to vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who, then, gets to decide whether someone is qualified to vote? No matter the election, the answer is always the same — the states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, by constitutional design, the states are tasked with setting voter-eligibility requirements — a product of our federalist system. For state and local elections, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-10/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;the 10th Amendment&lt;/a&gt; grants states the power to regulate their internal elections as they see fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;States also get to decide who may vote in federal elections, which include presidential and congressional elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to presidential elections, for instance, states have — &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ssrn.com/abstract=3702995\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;as I have previously written&lt;/a&gt; — exclusive power under the Constitution’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-2/section-1/clause-2/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;electors clause&lt;/a&gt; to decide how to conduct presidential elections within their borders, including who gets to vote in them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The states wield similar authority for congressional elections. Namely, according to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-2/clause-1/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Article 1 of the Constitution&lt;/a&gt; and the Constitution’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-17/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;17th Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, if someone can vote in their state’s legislative elections, they are entitled to vote in its congressional elections, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the Constitution provides Congress zero authority to govern voter-eligibility requirements in federal elections. Indeed, in the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2013 ruling on the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/570/1/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council&lt;/a&gt; case, the court asserted that nothing in the Constitution “lends itself to the view that voting qualifications in federal elections are to be set by Congress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is the SAVE America Act constitutional?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SAVE America Act presents a constitutional dilemma. By requiring individuals to show documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to vote, the SAVE America Act is implicitly saying that someone must be a U.S. citizen to vote in federal elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Congress would be instituting a qualification to vote, a power that the Constitution leaves exclusively to the states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, while all states currently limit voting rights to citizens, legal noncitizen voting is not without precedent. As &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;amp;context=lawineq\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2049&amp;amp;context=facsch_lawrev\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;scholars&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://repository.law.umich.edu/mjil/vol13/iss2/1/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;have noted&lt;/a&gt;, at least 19 states extended voting rights to free male “inhabitants,” including noncitizens, starting from our country’s founding up to and throughout the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, over 20 municipalities across the country, as well as the District of Columbia, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Laws_permitting_noncitizens_to_vote_in_the_United_States\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;allow permanent noncitizen residents&lt;/a&gt; to vote in local elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any state these days could similarly extend the right to vote in state and federal elections to permanent noncitizen residents. This is within their constitutional prerogative. And if this were to happen, there could be a conflict between that state’s voter-eligibility laws and the SAVE America Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, when state and federal laws conflict, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artVI-C2-1/ALDE_00013395/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;the Constitution’s supremacy clause&lt;/a&gt; mandates that federal law prevails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, in this instance, where Congress has no actual authority to implement voter qualifications, the SAVE America Act would seem to have no constitutional leg on which to stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reconciling the SAVE America Act with the Constitution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why have &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/7296/cosponsors\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;108 U.S. representatives&lt;/a&gt; sponsored a bill that likely exceeds Congress’ powers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Politics, of course, plays some role here. Namely, noncitizen voting is a major concern &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/18/over-half-of-americans-worried-non-citizens-vote-illegally-poll-finds-despite-little-evidence/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;among Republican politicians and voters&lt;/a&gt;. Every SAVE America Act co-sponsor is Republican, as were all but four of the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5242559-house-republicans-pass-bill-requiring-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;220 U.S. representatives&lt;/a&gt; who voted to pass the SAVE Act in April 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the constitutionality of the SAVE America Act, though, proponents simply assert that Congress is acting within its purview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, many proponents have cited the Constitution’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-4/clause-1/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;elections clause&lt;/a&gt;, which gives Congress the power to regulate the “Times, Places and Manner” of congressional elections, as support for that assertion. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, for example, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.deseret.com/u-s-world/2025/01/08/sen-lee-to-reintroduce-save-act-noncitizen-voting/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;explicitly referenced&lt;/a&gt; the elections clause when defending the SAVE Act earlier in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the elections clause only grants Congress authority to regulate election procedures, not voter qualifications. The Supreme Court explicitly stated this in the Inter Tribal Council ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress can, for instance, require states to adopt a uniform federal &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/6/Federal_Voter_Registration_ENG.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;voter registration form&lt;/a&gt; and even include a citizenship question on said form. What it cannot do, however, is implement a nonnegotiable mandate that effectively tells the states they can never allow any noncitizen to vote in a federal election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the SAVE America Act is simply legislation. Should the Senate pass it, Trump will almost assuredly sign it into law, given, among other factors, his recent call for Republicans &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/02/us/politics/trump-nationalize-elections.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;to nationalize elections&lt;/a&gt;. If and when that happens, the courts would have to reckon with the SAVE America Act’s legitimacy within the country’s constitutional design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;John J. Martin is an assistant professor of law specializing in election law at Quinnipiac University.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://theconversation.com/citizenship-voting-requirement-in-save-america-act-has-no-basis-in-the-constitution-and-ignores-precedent-that-only-states-decide-who-gets-to-vote-275658\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;version of this article &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;first appeared on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://theconversation.com/us\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;The Conversation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, a nonprofit news organization dedicated to sharing the knowledge of researchers and scholars.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-f80000\" name=\"html-embed-module-f80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"https://counter.theconversation.com/content/275658/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-advanced\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" style=\"border: none !important\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-900000\" name=\"module-900000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

From “Nine Below Zero” and the jazz-pop tune “Fever” to his original song “Skin Deep,” Guy was in top form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's his approach to the blues that fills a room. Writer and director Ryan Coogler uses that to anchor the film “Sinners” and pay tribute to the music as well as the culture. The film, which has garnered a record-breaking 16 Oscar nominations, displays the journey of a young man in the South navigating all the obstacles life threw at him and just trying to survive it all. That’s a story very similar to Guy’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about the parallels, Guy said, “Well, not only me, I think that happened to all of the blues players,” adding how the juke joint in the film was a true representation of the nightlife he experienced. “We learned from those great guys who just played for Saturday night fish fries — that was good enjoyment after picking and chopping cotton.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-ab0000\" name=\"image-ab0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/71d106c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F92%2Ff6%2Feb1e97fc4b4094a6a965a60a5193%2Fsinnersbuddy-260127-011.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a6a83ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F92%2Ff6%2Feb1e97fc4b4094a6a965a60a5193%2Fsinnersbuddy-260127-011.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/232b68f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F92%2Ff6%2Feb1e97fc4b4094a6a965a60a5193%2Fsinnersbuddy-260127-011.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Blues singer and guitarist Buddy Guy performs at his namesake club Buddy Guy&amp;#x27;s Legends in the Loop, Friday, Jan. 23, 2026. | Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/232b68f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F92%2Ff6%2Feb1e97fc4b4094a6a965a60a5193%2Fsinnersbuddy-260127-011.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4d74456/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F92%2Ff6%2Feb1e97fc4b4094a6a965a60a5193%2Fsinnersbuddy-260127-011.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/232b68f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F92%2Ff6%2Feb1e97fc4b4094a6a965a60a5193%2Fsinnersbuddy-260127-011.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sinners,” which has garnered a record-breaking 16 Oscar nominations, displays the journey of a young man in the South navigating all the obstacles life threw at him and just trying to survive it all.

King and needed some B.B. King lick, he was the guy they called,” bandmate Orlando Wright said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guy takes keeping the blues alive very seriously and continues to introduce the music to a new generation. He saw a resurgence in the 1980s and early 1990s, and has won several Grammys, including one this year for traditional blues album for “Ain't Done with the Blues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That staying power is one of the reasons Coogler wanted Guy in his movie, and he personally visited Legends to ask him to join the film. “Buddy Guy was the last musician I remember my uncle James making an effort to go see live even at the end of his life. He meant a lot to me 'cause he meant so much to my uncle so it was an honor to have him in the film,” Coogler told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the movie, the blues was a connector and somewhat of a superpower, with Guy serving as a bridge as well as a beacon. The cast all credit him with being the glue and the master. Delroy Lindo, who was nominated for an Oscar for his role as musician Delta Slim, told the Sun-Times, “I felt really honored that he could be such an integral part of the story.” Fellow Oscar nominee Wunmi Mosaku added: “I think Buddy Guy is a living legend. I can't believe I have the honor to share a screen with him. I am so grateful for his contribution to the blues and now my life. He's amazing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not a coincidence that as the elder Sammie in the movie and elder statesman of the blues, Guy has built a legacy rooted in endurance and his musical excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ryan had sent me an essential blues playlist that was full of Buddy Guy songs and that's where I kind of began to grow and learn my knowledge for the blues,” adds Miles Caton, who plays the younger Sammie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-b90000\" name=\"image-b90000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c4404e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2614x1467+37+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F52%2F75%2F944434e94c3f80a5383148eb165a%2Fap25104593768654.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8dd5779/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2614x1467+37+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F52%2F75%2F944434e94c3f80a5383148eb165a%2Fap25104593768654.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/019f6e4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2614x1467+37+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F52%2F75%2F944434e94c3f80a5383148eb165a%2Fap25104593768654.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"This image released by Warner Bros Pictures shows Miles Caton, center, in a scene from &amp;quot;Sinners.&amp;quot; (Warner Bros.

Kirke inherited her musician father’s record collection and noticed some scribbles on an album. “I asked my dad what did he draw on this album? He said, ‘I didn't draw anything. That's Buddy Guy's autograph.’ I'm really glad that I got to be in a movie with him even though I have never met him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guy’s bandmate Orlando Wright said the scene where Sammie performs a song that summons past and present spirits, intertwining many musical styles of Black people, captures the story of the blues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The music has not stayed the same, which is the struggle of the blues ... [But] a house built on sand cannot stand. That scene [in the movie] is the story right there,” said &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the packed room at Legends, Guy made his guitar cry a blues that was as educational as it was electrifying. From opening act Katie Kadan to Guy’s band members, they all paid homage to his journey and commitment to his craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s the real deal. He’s the connection from Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf to the present times. The best way I like to put it is he’s the blues version of Miles Davis,” bandmate Mike Wheeler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-270000\" name=\"image-270000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9004425/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2856+0+269/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3a%2Fe7%2F409b921a4496afdd5d9aa21c7901%2Fsinnersbuddy-260127-002.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e4cdbad/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2856+0+269/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3a%2Fe7%2F409b921a4496afdd5d9aa21c7901%2Fsinnersbuddy-260127-002.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6dd6c60/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2856+0+269/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3a%2Fe7%2F409b921a4496afdd5d9aa21c7901%2Fsinnersbuddy-260127-002.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Blues singer and guitarist Buddy Guy performs at his namesake club Buddy Guy&amp;#x27;s Legends in the Loop, Friday, Jan. 23, 2026. | Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6dd6c60/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2856+0+269/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3a%2Fe7%2F409b921a4496afdd5d9aa21c7901%2Fsinnersbuddy-260127-002.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f4b73d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2856+0+269/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3a%2Fe7%2F409b921a4496afdd5d9aa21c7901%2Fsinnersbuddy-260127-002.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6dd6c60/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5088x2856+0+269/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3a%2Fe7%2F409b921a4496afdd5d9aa21c7901%2Fsinnersbuddy-260127-002.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buddy Guy takes keeping the blues alive very seriously and continues to introduce the music to a new generation.

Melissa Bean is betting that her moderate brand of Democratic politics is due for a comeback 16 years after she was unseated by Tea Party conservative Joe Walsh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the redrawn 8th isn’t quite the swing district Bean first seized from longtime Republican Rep. Phil Crane in 2004. And in the era of President Donald Trump, Bean’s opponents in a crowded field of eight Democratic primary candidates say it’s a different conservative paradigm that she’s not equipped to fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bean argues voters in the district that stretches from a sliver of Chicago’s Northwest Side out to Elgin are crying out for pragmatism over polarization.  After stints at finance giants JPMorgan Chase and Mesirow Financial, the Barrington resident says she returned to the public arena because “I got tired of throwing my shoe at the television” in frustration with Trump policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I'm hearing mostly from people is they would love to see a little more boring and a lot less drama from government,” said Bean, who has pumped about $300,000 into a campaign that paced the field with $1 million on hand entering the new year. “They just want to know [if] they elect you, you’ll put your head down, you'll get the work done and you’ll deliver.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic contenders to the left of Bean say that’s not enough to address the concerns they’re hearing most from constituents: affordability, health care and social services that are on the chopping block in the Republican-led U.S. House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People of the district want someone who would stand up to Donald Trump,” said Junaid Ahmed, who’s making a comeback bid of his own after being soundly defeated by Krishnamoorthi in a 2022 primary challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahmed, a South Barrington tech entrepreneur who organized protests against the use of the McHenry County Jail as &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/2/15/22934966/chicago-immigration-illinois-way-forward-ice-detention-immigrants-detainees-mchenry-kankakee\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; under the Biden administration, closed 2025 with more than $835,000 in his campaign fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People have seen me standing shoulder-to-shoulder with them,” said Ahmed, who's endorsed by progressive Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. “That's what differentiates me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two-term Cook County Commissioner Kevin Morrison is another progressive candidate keeping tabs on who has advocated most forcefully against Trump policies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We've seen health care under attack, LGBT rights under attack, reproductive freedoms under attack — I've been involved in taking steps to push back against every one of those attacks,” said Morrison, the county board’s first openly gay member. “We've actually seen Joe Walsh speak more vocally against the attacks on our Constitution, our civil liberties and freedoms than [Bean] did in the last 15 years.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morrison, of Mount Prospect,   entered January with about $233,000 in his federal campaign fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanover Park Trustee Yasmeen Bankole, who has worked in the offices of both Krishnamoorthi and U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, echoed the need for a new generation of leadership to “help us survive the next three years of the Trump administration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Working for Congress, it's felt like a war,” said Bankole, whose campaign had about $171,000 in the bank. “My experience has not only allowed me to fully understand the role of a good federal legislator that can actually enact change, but leading in times of chaos.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d00000\" name=\"image-d00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b20356b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6712x3767+0+354/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9c%2F70%2F40eea4a14e1a9eed5187c8b0d235%2F8th-3.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7769f6a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6712x3767+0+354/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9c%2F70%2F40eea4a14e1a9eed5187c8b0d235%2F8th-3.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5eafac2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6712x3767+0+354/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9c%2F70%2F40eea4a14e1a9eed5187c8b0d235%2F8th-3.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Four of the eight candidates running in the 8th Congressional District Democratic primary election (left to right): Dan Tully, Ryan Vetticad, Junaid Ahmed and Sanjyot Dunung.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5eafac2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6712x3767+0+354/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9c%2F70%2F40eea4a14e1a9eed5187c8b0d235%2F8th-3.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f386b73/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6712x3767+0+354/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9c%2F70%2F40eea4a14e1a9eed5187c8b0d235%2F8th-3.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5eafac2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6712x3767+0+354/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9c%2F70%2F40eea4a14e1a9eed5187c8b0d235%2F8th-3.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four of the eight candidates running in the 8th Congressional District Democratic primary election (left to right): Dan Tully, Ryan Vetticad, Junaid Ahmed and Sanjyot Dunung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times file photos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Tully is a former judge advocate in the U.S. Army Reserve and foreign assistance worker for the Department of Commerce who left federal service in protest of Trump policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm the only person in the race with experience practicing law — that's important when the rule of law is at stake,” said Tully, of Carol Stream, calling his military experience “especially relevant as we see the president turn to the military as an instrument to express his imperial aspirations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoffman Estates tech businessman Neil Khot said his private-sector success could bring “common-sense solutions” to Washington. While that includes lowering interest rates — as Trump has pushed for — Khot decries the president’s tariffs and “the chaos of putting ICE on the streets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Des Plaines resident Sanjyot Dunung, who runs a global education company and served on a foreign working group in Biden's administration, also presents a center-left, business-focused platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We [Democrats] get very caught up in sort of the performative nature of being angry with what's going on, and certainly there's good cause to be angry. But we really need to rebuild the middle politically,” Dunung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Vetticad, 24, worked as a Justice Department data analyst assisting on the investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. He also resigned in protest. “I just desperately think we need younger voices in Congress.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winner of the March 17 primary will face the nominee from the Republican field: Kevin Ake, Jennifer Davis, Herbert Hebein or Mark Rice.&lt;/p&gt;",

And while some may draw comparisons to the plethora of Food Network or Cooking Channel offerings, America’s Culinary Cup (ACC) host — food expert, cookbook author and the former “Top Chef” host Padma Lakshmi — claims she’ll take everything to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought the genre was ready for a shake-up, for a refresh, and for something new and different. And I wanted to be the one who did it,” &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.tvinsider.com/gallery/americas-culinary-cup-chefs-premiere-date-host/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Lakshmi told the media&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the Television Critics Association Winter Tour in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several female chefs in the cast, including two Chicagoans: James Beard Award winner Chef Beverly Kim of Parachute Hi-Fi in Avondale (co-owned with her husband Chef Johnny Clark), and executive chef/owner and James Beard nominee Diana Dávila of Mi Tocaya Antojería in Logan Square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show’s mission? Challenge each chef in what the series calls “10 culinary commandments”: meat, vegetables, sauces, dessert, innovation, flavors, sustainability, world cuisine, consistency and culinary science/technology. Chefs will be judged on taste, creativity, presentation and technique as they pertain to each commandment. Sharing judging duties with Lakshmi are Michelin-starred chefs/restaurateurs, LA-based Michael Cimarusti (Providence, and Connie and Ted’s) and New York-based Wylie Dufresne (Stretch pizza).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lakshmi told &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://people.com/padma-lakshmi-returns-to-tv-as-host-of-america-s-culinary-cup-get-a-first-look-exclusive-11905324\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;People &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;the elite 16 are “the most decorated group to ever compete against each other,” a group that includes James Beard Award winners/nominees, Michelin Star recipients, a “Top Chef” champion and Bocuse D’Or gold and silver medalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"  data-align-floatLeft&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-8e0000\" name=\"image-8e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eb8a595/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1973x1107+0+946/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2Fd8%2F0a572c434ae7bdbfb4d612cd2d17%2Fbeverly-kim-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/81e5083/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1973x1107+0+946/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2Fd8%2F0a572c434ae7bdbfb4d612cd2d17%2Fbeverly-kim-2.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/acc1e6a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1973x1107+0+946/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2Fd8%2F0a572c434ae7bdbfb4d612cd2d17%2Fbeverly-kim-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"“Spoiled for Stroganoff” – Sixteen of the nation’s most talented chefs step into Padma Lakshmi’s fiercely competitive arena, each bringing their unique flair and signature dishes to the table – with $1 million dollars on the line, the battle for culinary supremacy begins.

At the same time you’re filtering what’s given in the moment, what’s in the [on-set] pantry [for example]. … At the end of the day it’s making a decision and sticking with it,” said Kim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chefs said they had no idea who comprised the rest of the lineup until they were revealed during the taping of the first episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was so scared,” Dávila said. “It was really great to see Beverly; it makes you feel not alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Kim has previously competed on “Top Chef,” (finishing 4th in 2011), Dávila is a newbie to the concept, but she said she welcomed the opportunity at this point in her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s wanting to have a challenge, do something out of the norm. ... Just wanting an adventure,” Dávila said. “We say a lot of dumb things when we're young, like, I’m not gonna do a TV competition. That’s not what real chefs do. And all that kind of stuff. So many years later I have friends who have done it and I started watching shows here and there, and … I’m like, why not try it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s another benefit, she admitted. ”It’s good for business,” Dávila added. “The business woman in me is, like, if you have an opportunity to challenge yourself and maybe shed some light and maybe get a broader audience for Mi Tocaya, why not do it? … It’s almost like checking your privilege, too. This is an opportunity that not a lot of people get.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both chefs say they did receive some competition advice from those they hold near and dear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Kim, it came from her “biggest cheerleader,” her husband, partly in the form of a gift — a St. Sebastian medal she wears on a necklace that accompanied her throughout the show. Sebastian is considered the patron saint of archers and soldiers, invoking strength and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c40000\" name=\"image-c40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dd01238/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F73%2F15%2F732ebfd14f7399e16becb2e60ee1%2Fculinarycup-2603040128.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/773a134/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F73%2F15%2F732ebfd14f7399e16becb2e60ee1%2Fculinarycup-2603040128.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e03e1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F73%2F15%2F732ebfd14f7399e16becb2e60ee1%2Fculinarycup-2603040128.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Beverly Kim holds a necklace her husband gave her at Parachute Hi-Fi.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e03e1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F73%2F15%2F732ebfd14f7399e16becb2e60ee1%2Fculinarycup-2603040128.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b2c673/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F73%2F15%2F732ebfd14f7399e16becb2e60ee1%2Fculinarycup-2603040128.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e03e1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F73%2F15%2F732ebfd14f7399e16becb2e60ee1%2Fculinarycup-2603040128.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim wears a St. Sebastian medal — a gift from her husband — throughout the show.

Jan Schakowsky’s seat in one of the most competitive races the state has seen in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kat Abughazaleh, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss and state Sen. Laura Fine, D-Glenview, are the fundraising leaders in the 9th District Congressional race for a seat that hasn’t been open since 1999. Before that, the seat was represented by Sidney R. Yates, who held it for 24 terms — with a two-year gap for an unsuccessful Senate bid in 1962 against Everett Dirksen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Voters in one of the most Democratic districts in the state will see 16 names on the March 17 ballot. Bruce Leon’s name will be on there too, although he dropped out of the race and endorsed another candidate: former FBI agent Phil Andrew. Leon, a pro-Israel Democrat, blamed “tremendous political pressure from Washington, D.C., interests” — referring to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee — for dropping out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC is indeed playing a role in the race — with Fine accepting donations associated with the pro-Israel lobbying group. AIPAC hasn’t endorsed Fine, but an AIPAC-affiliated super PAC is running ads to support her bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abughazaleh, Biss, Fine, Andrew and Skokie School District 73.5 board member Bushra Amiwala are all airing TV ads in the final weeks of the race. State Sen. Mike Simmons, D-Chicago; economist Jeff Cohen; state Rep.

She’s also using that time to tell voters about her platform, which includes universal health care, protections against price-gouging, more housing with federal incentives, climate action — and removing lead pipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former journalist turned social media content creator has amassed an impressive fundraising haul of more than $3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abughazaleh studied “atrocity, extremism and genocide” at George Washington University, and she calls the war in Gaza a genocide.

Abughazaleh calls the charges ”BS” and says she plans on “winning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of this is a psychological aspect. … And there's just the aspect of, even if we know that we’re innocent, facing possibly like eight years in federal prison,” Abughazaleh said. “It weighs on you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The political newcomer jumped into the race before Schakowsky announced her retirement — another populist move that has won her both supporters and critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s a badge of honor to be the only person in this race that didn’t wait in line or ask for permission,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abughazaleh moved to Illinois in 2024, and her opponents have used that to try to paint her as an outsider. Abughazaleh said her grandparents were survivors of the mass displacement of Palestinians in 1948  and immigrated to Chicago. Her grandfather went back to the Middle East and brought her dad to Chicago.   She recently learned that her grandfather was an aide to Mayor Richard J. Daley, “providing oversight against financial corruption” in the late 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She calls herself “the most progressive on foreign policy” of any of the candidates, and touts that she hasn’t met with AIPAC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Daniel Biss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biss is a former mathematician, state representative and state senator who was elected Evanston mayor in 2021. He ran for governor in 2018 and landed a distant second behind now-Gov. JB Pritzker. As mayor, he enacted an ordinance to curb carbon emissions and came up with a comprehensive housing plan for the north suburb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s endorsed by Schakowsky, and he’s also among candidates in the field who have protested at Broadview. He has amassed nearly $2 million, and he says he’s proud that he’s receiving most of his contributions locally — trying to draw a contrast to out-of-state donors for both Abughazaleh and Fine. Abughazaleh says many of her donors are giving money under $200, which don’t require disclosure of a location. And asked about the out-of-state contributions, Fine said she’s “really proud of the momentum” that her campaign is building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-140000\" name=\"image-140000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ded3bf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6184x3471+0+327/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6d%2F47%2F2d20fb9541c3bacfb0fd17d9fa3a%2Fborderpatrol-121825-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/721a05a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6184x3471+0+327/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6d%2F47%2F2d20fb9541c3bacfb0fd17d9fa3a%2Fborderpatrol-121825-10.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ce56fe6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6184x3471+0+327/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6d%2F47%2F2d20fb9541c3bacfb0fd17d9fa3a%2Fborderpatrol-121825-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss approaches federal immigration enforcement agents after an individual was detained outside a Mobil gas station at 1950 Green Bay Road in Evanston Dec. 17, 2025.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ce56fe6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6184x3471+0+327/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6d%2F47%2F2d20fb9541c3bacfb0fd17d9fa3a%2Fborderpatrol-121825-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/32dc13c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6184x3471+0+327/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6d%2F47%2F2d20fb9541c3bacfb0fd17d9fa3a%2Fborderpatrol-121825-10.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ce56fe6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6184x3471+0+327/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6d%2F47%2F2d20fb9541c3bacfb0fd17d9fa3a%2Fborderpatrol-121825-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss approaches federal immigration enforcement agents last December after a person was detained outside a Mobil gas station in Evanston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anybody who's supporting me is supporting my record, supporting a record of getting things changed when it comes to health care, standing up to corporate polluters, making sure Illinois is a 100% pro choice state,” Fine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biss paints himself as both an activist and a lawmaker, and said he thinks the dual role is what defines him in the race. The mayor  got into a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/12/17/chicago-immigration-ice-border-patrol-bovino-president-donald-trump-deport-midway-blitz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;heated clash with Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at an Evanston gas station last December, and later described Bovino as a “condescending, sarcastic liar.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I think sets me apart is that I'm the only candidate who's fought and won inside a government and fought and won out on the streets,” Biss said. “I think we need both in this moment. I think Jan Schakowsky has been both, and I think that we can't afford to compromise on either of those capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Laura Fine&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine has served in the state Senate since 2018 and previously served in the Illinois House. She first ran for office after her husband was in a car accident and their health insurance policy was canceled.  She became an expert in insurance policy and brought that knowledge to the Illinois House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you look at my 13-year record, I've brought Illinois from a state that really favored the industry to now one of the most consumer-friendly states when it comes to health care in the country,” Fine said. “And I want to bring that those skills to Washington and support programs like Medicare for All, so we can build a better, more simple healthcare system that gives everybody high quality care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether she supports term limits in Congress, especially after Schakowsky’s six terms, Fine said that while “it’s up to the voters” to decide, “every once in a while, I think you need some new blood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-190000\" name=\"image-190000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/927d322/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc2%2Fe8%2F0d3aace143a39b1a0bcc88a2d0db%2Fmentalhealth-082621-05.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bf59870/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc2%2Fe8%2F0d3aace143a39b1a0bcc88a2d0db%2Fmentalhealth-082621-05.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/da2081c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc2%2Fe8%2F0d3aace143a39b1a0bcc88a2d0db%2Fmentalhealth-082621-05.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"State Sen.

He’s also zeroing in on human rights and health care accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-030000\" name=\"image-030000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8a88d88/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5803x3257+0+306/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2F01%2Fa375d4dc4c579584197a7c9d07ed%2Fweissfolo-080925-9.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b0ea110/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5803x3257+0+306/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2F01%2Fa375d4dc4c579584197a7c9d07ed%2Fweissfolo-080925-9.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a82eed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5803x3257+0+306/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2F01%2Fa375d4dc4c579584197a7c9d07ed%2Fweissfolo-080925-9.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"State Rep.

Her campaign platform includes “real consequences” for “fascist Republicans in Washington and their foot soldiers in ICE,” including losing all benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil Andrew survived a mass shooting in Winnetka in 1988, then became an FBI agent specializing in negotiations and a gun control advocate. His platform includes protecting democracy by demanding accountability, affordable health care and child care and holding ICE accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patricia Brown is a lifelong Evanston resident who previously worked in health care, education, corporate America and for the American Bar Association. Her platform includes affordable housing, clean energy transition and education reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Cohen, an economist, says the country needs a “revenue-neutral income and child care bill” that would modernize both credits to allow for monthly or quarterly payments without changing eligibility criteria or benefit levels.

His platform includes expanding mental health care and reproductive freedoms, broad-based economic growth and \"thoughtful” and “cooperative” trade policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Pyati, a former Microsoft strategist, said he believes artificial intelligence, clean energy and new technology are reshaping work and life. Part of his platform includes teaching AI literacy in schools, easing the tax burden on working families and reversing Medicaid cuts.&lt;/p&gt;",

Here in Chicago, the city reinstated an indoor mask mandate for stores, restaurants, gyms and other places where humans gathered in public. Into this dismal scene, local food writer Mike Sula launched a tiny, hopeful project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea was simple: Invite an up-and-coming chef to offer a special menu at a local bar for one night only, pop-up style. Sula, the Chicago Reader’s longtime dining critic, had been nursing the concept since at least the beginning of 2020, and the initial COVID shutdown in March added an urgent twist. As the pandemic grinded through its paralyzing first year, he noticed a trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these unknown restaurant workers — bartenders, servers, line cooks — that had been furloughed or laid off started cooking out of their apartments or out of shared kitchen and doing preorder deliveries or drop-offs,” Sula said.

Held on Mondays, when traffic can be so slow that restaurants often close anyway, the event brings in new business. Chefs pay for ingredients and labor and, correspondingly, take 100% of food sales. The host venue loans the use of its kitchen and space for free and pockets the rest: All beverage sales, including any special menu of drinks it creates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sula, the evening’s impresario, has absorbed the pet project into his day job at the Chicago Reader, which revived its print edition just this month under new ownership. Neither he nor the Reader takes a cut, and Sula chips in event marketing by writing a preview story about the week’s featured chef — which, he said, has become a reliable way to keep readers informed about the latest developments in Chicago’s ever-fermenting dining scene. In his view, it’s a win-win-win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years and counting, the weekly event has served an early preview of at least a few chefs who have taken an innovative concept to the next level: Akahoshi Ramen, the acclaimed brick-and-mortar noodle shop in Logan Square, is probably the splashiest example. Mike Satinover, a celebrity within a deeply nerdy Subreddit community where he goes by “Ramen_Lord,” made his first of two Foodball appearances on Nov. 8, 2021. It was just one stop of many in his single-minded quest to replicate authentic Sapporo-style noodles and broth not only from scratch but with an &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicagomag.com/chicago-magazine/march-2024/the-ramen-lord/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;obsessive attention to technique&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and repeatability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Sula would be the first in line to say that Foodball does not deserve credit for the success of a chef or be counted among the data points that lead to the opening of a restaurant. As he notes, pop-up culinary events were a thing long before he invented his; he cites chef Won Kim’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.kimskichicago.net/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Kimski&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the Korean-Polish counter service joint in Bridgeport, in particular as an important current incubator of rising chefs, and there’s substantial overlap between chefs showing up there and at Sula’s Foodballs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-080000\" name=\"image-080000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8193bba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2Fdb%2Fd5aba0f64a9ea1e031089fb89f50%2Ffoodball-260225-15.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0d6f2ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2Fdb%2Fd5aba0f64a9ea1e031089fb89f50%2Ffoodball-260225-15.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b6f21c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2Fdb%2Fd5aba0f64a9ea1e031089fb89f50%2Ffoodball-260225-15.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Vinod Kalathil, and Margaret Pak, co-owners of Thattu, sit together inside the Avondale restaurant, Monday, Feb. 9, 2026. | Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b6f21c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2Fdb%2Fd5aba0f64a9ea1e031089fb89f50%2Ffoodball-260225-15.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a0866d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2Fdb%2Fd5aba0f64a9ea1e031089fb89f50%2Ffoodball-260225-15.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b6f21c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2Fdb%2Fd5aba0f64a9ea1e031089fb89f50%2Ffoodball-260225-15.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vinod Kalathil and Margaret Pak, co-owners of Thattu, host Monday Night Foodball at their Avondale restaurant.

After being laid off from her white-collar career (banking, then pharmaceuticals marketing) in 2015, Pak decided to chase her dream of cooking for a living. Her vision was arranged loosely around the cuisine of her husband’s native Kerala, the lush region on India’s southwestern coast. Pak initially wanted to make a business out of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicagoreader.com/food/thattu-the-citys-only-keralite-restaurant-began-with-a-biscuit/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;replicating a bakery cookie&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; she encountered on trips to Kalathil’s hometown — the spicy, crispy masala biscuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then one thing led to another and, by 2019, Pak had earned a James Beard semifinalist nomination for her stall in the West Loop’s Politan Row food hall. She did her first Foodball in early 2022 and her last in early 2023, just months before she and Kalathil opened Thattu as a stand-alone restaurant at 2601 W. Fletcher St. This past October, Thattu took over hosting Foodball, which had lost its bar partner when Frank and Mary’s Tavern changed hands and closed for renovations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pak and Kalathil agree that Foodball is more than just another thing-to-do for foodies. The regular gatherings, which bring together curious customers with chefs and other industry folks on their night off, have become a node in Chicago’s dining ecosystem. “Especially during the pandemic,” Pak said. “That's when we realized how tightly knit the community itself is.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;* * *&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e20000\" name=\"image-e20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/076f779/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0e%2F8a%2F039716ba43d9a32f9a8f01fc0310%2Ffoodball-260225-3.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7097437/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0e%2F8a%2F039716ba43d9a32f9a8f01fc0310%2Ffoodball-260225-3.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6715761/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0e%2F8a%2F039716ba43d9a32f9a8f01fc0310%2Ffoodball-260225-3.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mia Torres-Lucero, sous chef at Meze Table along with Elizabeth Gartelos Morris, Beth Salentiy prepares some dishes in the kitchen at Thattu located at 2601 W.

On the menu were yuvarlakia (beef and pork meatballs in broth), lachanopita (crispy filo with spinach) and their velvety gigantes plaki (Greek butter beans in tomato sauce), among other items including gyros two ways and a feta cheesecake topped with cherries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Meze Table’s fourth time making its homestyle Greek cooking and Athenian street food available to the Foodball crowd — which is a nice opportunity for fans since the business does not operate a restaurant. “You get to serve all these new clientele that you normally wouldn’t reach,” said Gartelos Morris, the 49-year-old executive chef of Meze Table. “And it’s an incredible opportunity to try something new out and see if it lands with people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"

in Wicker Park and, over time, each migrated into the restaurant industry. They came together as business partners in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always really loved to cook, and I was at home with these tiny little kids,” Gartelos Morris said of a period when she was a stay-at-home mom. “So I started making these tasting plates — my friend called them toddler tapas — basically just whatever I had left over. Like pickles and hot dogs and goldfish crackers and whatever delicious cheese I wanted and whatever beautiful crackers I could get my hands on. And I started noticing the prettier I made them and the more colorful they were, the more things they were eating. I started taking pictures of it [and] putting it on Instagram, and people started going, ‘Hey, can you do that for me?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her husband, a graphic designer, smelled an opportunity. That’s a business, he said. But it wasn’t anything — until Gartelos Morris pulled in Salentiny, at the time managing The Duck Inn, chef Kevin Hickey’s elevated tavern in Bridgeport. Together, the two women created Meze Table, today a thriving catering operation that also sells its dips, salads and frozen, ready-to-eat Greek meals at farmers markets on the South Side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now on the verge of opening a brick-and-mortar market in Bridgeport, Meze Table has come a long way since the days when Gartelos Morris first started attracting notice on Facebook and Instagram. Pop-up events like Foodball, the Beths say, helped them develop their recipes while also building a following of customers in Chicago, something that doesn’t always translate from a social media audience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;* * *&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-df0000\" name=\"image-df0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7156e22/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F89%2F81%2F179ce9594c3983e75283b39a1f05%2Fimg-4655.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d859f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F89%2F81%2F179ce9594c3983e75283b39a1f05%2Fimg-4655.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b3408dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F89%2F81%2F179ce9594c3983e75283b39a1f05%2Fimg-4655.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"IMG_4655.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b3408dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F89%2F81%2F179ce9594c3983e75283b39a1f05%2Fimg-4655.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0daa939/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F89%2F81%2F179ce9594c3983e75283b39a1f05%2Fimg-4655.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b3408dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2263+0+381/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F89%2F81%2F179ce9594c3983e75283b39a1f05%2Fimg-4655.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joyce Famakinwa and Folake Dosu have been attending roughly twice a month since Foodball’s early days at Kedzie Inn.

Thumbs-up all around, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her friend Folake Dosu have been attending roughly twice a month since the event’s early days at Kedzie Inn. The 30-something Logan Square residents were among the lucky 50 people who got a seat for the Ramen Lord’s Foodball back in 2021. “I’m embarrassed to admit it now, but I wasn't really a big ramen person back then,” Famakinwa said. “So for me, it really was an opportunity to branch out and try something. I thought the food was incredible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Famakinwa and Dosu, the weekly event has evolved from boisterous group outing to something more akin to a relationship ritual. “It’s a way to discover new chefs, but, on a personal level, it’s just a nice way to start the week,” Famakinwa said. “Folake and I talk pretty regularly. We’ve been friends since we were kids. But, you know, maybe if we invite a friend that we haven’t caught up with in a while, that’s an opportunity to kind of just take a beat and have these great conversations and decompress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sula seems content to have Monday Night Foodball bump along until it comes to its natural resting place. Now that dining recommendations come from so many sources — some reliable, others less so — he figures offering a way to meet local chefs, enjoy a tasty bite and connect with people over a shared enthusiasm might be the dish Chicagoans are actually craving right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Find the Monday Night Foodball schedule of upcoming events at &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"http://chicagoreader.com/foodball\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;chicagoreader.com/foodball&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

They’re often the first in their family to pursue higher education, and frequently come up against the perception that they are not “college material.” Across the country, they are the least likely student group to finish a degree within six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1111&amp;amp;context=epe_etds\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Research has&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that mentors, especially those who are also Black and male-identifying, can help, whether that’s by sharing how they navigated similar obstacles or by connecting mentees to tutoring, mental health care and even food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But people who work with mentoring initiatives say there are more young people in Chicago who could benefit from this support than there are mentors. That's especially true in Black and segregated communities where students are less likely to have access to adults with postsecondary experience who might know what it’s like to wade through complicated higher education systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why local advocates are asking Chicagoans of all backgrounds to put themselves forward, either by volunteering with a mentoring organization or by connecting with young people through their churches, alma maters or fraternities and sororities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can be dedicated and trustworthy, if you have the time and are reliable, please, please sign up to be a mentor with whatever organization that you want,” said Nakia Samuels, who directs youth programming for the nonprofit &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chiul.org/mentoring/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Chicago Urban League&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is launching a mentorship program this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WBEZ spoke with Samuels and others about the characteristics that make for great mentors, and how you can offer your time if you’ve never been a mentor before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Everyone has something to offer as a mentor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re into crafting or opera and you worry you won’t be able to relate to a young Black student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chances are, there is a student out there who shares your interests, Samuels said.

But mentors should approach the relationship with curiosity and openness, and start by getting to know their mentee and how to relate to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's really just starting where you're at,” he said, without assuming you’ll immediately know how to solve your mentee’s problems. “Then lots of questions, not lots of answers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, Samuels said, a mentee needs someone who will really listen to them — without checking their phone or multi-tasking — more than they need a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module  data-align-fullBleed&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-6e0000\" name=\"module-6e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListAI\"  data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-reading-time=\"true\"\n\n style=\"\n--titleColor:#eb1010\n\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-100000\" name=\"list-100000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                More reporting from The Persistence Project\n            \n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        \n\n        \n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    \n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"PageListAI-items\" data-with-borders&gt;\n            \n            &lt;div class=\"PageListAI-items-item\"&gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"PagePromoB\"&gt;\n    \n        \n    &lt;div class=\"PagePromo-media\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\" aria-label=\"In Austin, Black mentors are making college possible\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/12/18/in-austin-neighborhood-of-chicago-black-mentors-are-making-college-possible\" &gt;&lt;picture data-crop=\"medium-4x3\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n                &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"328\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a885f25/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8163x5464+0+0/resize/490x328!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F28%2F61%2Fe7d978234a5da0405be5cc6eb847%2Faustinmentors-121925-009.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzMjhweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"328\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f492eb3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8163x5464+0+0/resize/490x328!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F28%2F61%2Fe7d978234a5da0405be5cc6eb847%2Faustinmentors-121925-009.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzMjhweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A young Black man wearing a blue long-sleeve shirt looks at an older Black man sitting next to him who is wearing a suit and tie.\" width=\"490\" height=\"328\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f492eb3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8163x5464+0+0/resize/490x328!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F28%2F61%2Fe7d978234a5da0405be5cc6eb847%2Faustinmentors-121925-009.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzMjhweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    \n\n    &lt;div class=\"PagePromoB-content\"&gt;\n        \n    &lt;div class=\"PagePromo-category\"&gt;\n        &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education\"   &gt;Education&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        \n    &lt;div class=\"PagePromo-title\"&gt;\n        &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/12/18/in-austin-neighborhood-of-chicago-black-mentors-are-making-college-possible\"   &gt;In Austin, Black mentors are making college possible&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n        \n    &lt;div class=\"PagePromo-description\"&gt;Black men in the West Side community face some of the biggest hurdles to getting a degree.

If that’s beyond a mentor’s expertise, they can turn to their network of friends and colleagues to see if they can connect students to the resources they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tell your mentee what they’re good at &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuels said this one is especially important for Black children and boys because, often, they aren’t told their strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They don't hear, ‘This is what you're great at,’ Samuels said. “It's always, ‘Don't, don't, don't.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Watson, Jr. said mentors aren’t there to judge, but to offer young people a safe place to be themselves and talk about their hardships and their mistakes. He takes that approach at Young Black Men Of Honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The standard is high, the learning is rich, the outcomes are important,” he said. “But first and foremost, y'all free to be kids up in here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Don’t expect anything in return&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your mentee may not always take your advice, and it can be hard to watch them screw up or go through tough times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You may not even get a thank you,” Samuels said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But mentors who have done this work say they learn so much from their mentees, and there’s no feeling quite like helping a young person get their college acceptance letter or cross the commencement stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your heart's got to be in the right place, because the work is hard work,” Watson, Jr. said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown, the college professor, says it’s important to remember that not every mentor-mentee relationship is forever, and that’s okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As students grow, their needs change,” he said. “Outgrowing a mentor doesn’t mean the relationship failed. It means it worked.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lisa Kurian Philip covers higher education for WBEZ, in partnership with &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.opencampusmedia.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Open Campus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module  data-align-fullBleed&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-b00000\" name=\"module-b00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Interested in becoming a mentor?

We meet Levi ( David Stobbe), who has fallen head-over-heels for Kara (Ashley Neal) after only knowing her for about a year. Levi is explaining this love to his best friend Doug (Glenn Obrero), who is about to be the best man at Levi’s upcoming wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a spoiler here: In the blink of an eye, we jump from a love-struck Levi singing a cheesy remix of Billy Joel’s “We Didn’t Start the Fire,” — with revamped lyrics about how he met Kara — to Levi’s decapitation. A motor explodes on an irrigation pivot, and in the first 10 minutes, we pivot from a new love rom-com to a dark comedy about death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RatingCard Enhancement\" data-module data-rating=\"3.0\"  data-align-center&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RatingCard-title\"&gt;\n        &amp;quot;Pivot&amp;quot;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    &lt;div class=\"RatingCard-content\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-cc0000\" name=\"module-cc0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where&lt;/b&gt;: Rivendell Theatre, 5779 N.

Everything happens so fast. All of the bones for a fantastic play are here, but the pacing doesn’t leave enough room for us to adequately connect to the characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its best, the play soars into near absurd scenes leaving me wondering, How did we get here?&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;When Kara takes the mic at Levi’s wake, she is wearing her wedding dress. She starts her speech by describing her sex life with the recently deceased in front of his entire family, earning a roar of laughter, or shock, that ripples through the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-5f0000\" name=\"image-5f0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cdd839e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6602x3705+0+1191/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2F78%2F721567a748de92c8e7a419e636b9%2Fashley-neal-glenn-obrero-and-david-stobbe-background.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3ee6a7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6602x3705+0+1191/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2F78%2F721567a748de92c8e7a419e636b9%2Fashley-neal-glenn-obrero-and-david-stobbe-background.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d9de745/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6602x3705+0+1191/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2F78%2F721567a748de92c8e7a419e636b9%2Fashley-neal-glenn-obrero-and-david-stobbe-background.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Ashley Neal, Glenn Obrero and David Stobbe in &amp;quot;Pivot&amp;quot;\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d9de745/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6602x3705+0+1191/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2F78%2F721567a748de92c8e7a419e636b9%2Fashley-neal-glenn-obrero-and-david-stobbe-background.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0497542/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6602x3705+0+1191/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2F78%2F721567a748de92c8e7a419e636b9%2Fashley-neal-glenn-obrero-and-david-stobbe-background.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d9de745/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6602x3705+0+1191/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2F78%2F721567a748de92c8e7a419e636b9%2Fashley-neal-glenn-obrero-and-david-stobbe-background.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first 10 minutes, we “Pivot” goes from a new love rom-com to a dark comedy about death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Michael Brosilow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, there are scenes that don’t feel fully baked. Kara explains to the priest — who was once hired for the wedding and is now running the funeral procession — that she prayed for her father to die as a child. She even witnessed his death and didn’t intervene. But we never learn why she hated her father. Perhaps that isn't important. But it feels like a missed opportunity to further explore this character and solidify her desperate attempts to be liked by Levi’s father, George.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Kupferer, who plays George, is a superb actor. At times, he felt underutilized in this production. We are told, in passing, that his relationship with his son wasn’t the best. That could have been more fleshed out. As the old-school, emotionally repressed father figure, he doesn’t really speak full thoughts in the first act. By Act Two, he has a sudden burst of emotion and it is a reminder of what he is actually capable. I wonder why we had to wait so late in the production to get this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kupferer and Neal handle their roles deftly. Their relationship becomes central to the play, as a father who has missed having a relationship with his son and a young woman without a father. They eventually find solace in each other, but the duo needs more time to realize their own relationship. Without building up these plot lines, the payoff in the end feels unearned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are juicy moments throughout. Kara’s refusal to allow an entire town to grieve is funny, especially with her adamant choice to make Levi’s funeral a hybrid wedding. This opens the door for plenty of hijinks, which the production delivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obrero is a delight as Doug. The explosion that killed Levi leaves Doug with an eye patch and a cast. At the bachelor party — Kara insists on going through with the bachelor party even though the groom is dead — Doug gets shot in the other eye with a paintball gun. He performs the rest of the show comically blinded with each eye bandaged from injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-b40000\" name=\"image-b40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1484554/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+738/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F52%2F1d%2Fab970f6c437cbdec2d6a251fcaf5%2Fglenn-obrero-and-keith-kupferer.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/15834a8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+738/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F52%2F1d%2Fab970f6c437cbdec2d6a251fcaf5%2Fglenn-obrero-and-keith-kupferer.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/11046e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+738/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F52%2F1d%2Fab970f6c437cbdec2d6a251fcaf5%2Fglenn-obrero-and-keith-kupferer.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Glenn Obrero and Keith Kupferer in &amp;quot;Pivot.&amp;quot;\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/11046e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+738/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F52%2F1d%2Fab970f6c437cbdec2d6a251fcaf5%2Fglenn-obrero-and-keith-kupferer.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f421698/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+738/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F52%2F1d%2Fab970f6c437cbdec2d6a251fcaf5%2Fglenn-obrero-and-keith-kupferer.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/11046e7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+738/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F52%2F1d%2Fab970f6c437cbdec2d6a251fcaf5%2Fglenn-obrero-and-keith-kupferer.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glenn Obrero (left) is a delight as Doug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Michael Brosilow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I appreciate when playwrights take a swing. Lubischer leans into the absurdity of hosting a wedding-funeral hybrid and overall it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the production would benefit from giving more space to understanding George and Kara and letting their relationship blossom naturally. Outside of the laughs, the play also wants to talk about grief and letting go. If the show slows down, and allows those ideas to percolate, the audience will leave more fulfilled, and the final scene will be much more satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;",

It’s been streaky, but it’s been a winter closer to what lives in long memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical Chicago winter is good for business for certain sectors of the economy. That includes car mechanics and auto body shops, according to Mike Wendling, an IAM Local 701 organizer who represents those workers in the Chicago region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the extreme weathers is when you just make more money than normal,” Wendling said of his workforce, adding that cold, snow and ice cause more dead batteries, more busted tires and more cosmetically-damaging car accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some other businesses that get a bump from a bitter winter include natural gas companies, HVAC repair companies and plumbers (here’s your reminder to insulate your water pipes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Chicago winters are actually getting milder in terms of average number of days below freezing. The city has experienced an average of 15 fewer days below freezing in the last decade, compared to the period between 1959 and 1980, according to a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicagobusiness.com/crains-forum-winter-climate-changes/chicago-winters-new-normal\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;2025 Crain’s analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, do mild winters have a noticeable effect on the local economy? It’s a complicated question with many compounding variables. According to recent economic research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the answer in the short term is: Yes, but the effects are short-lived. In the longer term, the answer is also yes, but exactly how remains to be seen, as climate change is predicted to cause “substantial reallocations of people and jobs across the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f40000\" name=\"image-f40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ef13aa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4256x2389+0+82/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2Fb3%2F8b1362614514888ada07852d59e2%2Fdig-cst-0207-6.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ad351e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4256x2389+0+82/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2Fb3%2F8b1362614514888ada07852d59e2%2Fdig-cst-0207-6.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e262f08/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4256x2389+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2Fb3%2F8b1362614514888ada07852d59e2%2Fdig-cst-0207-6.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"dig-CST-0207-6.JPG\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e262f08/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4256x2389+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2Fb3%2F8b1362614514888ada07852d59e2%2Fdig-cst-0207-6.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b99666a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4256x2389+0+82/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2Fb3%2F8b1362614514888ada07852d59e2%2Fdig-cst-0207-6.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e262f08/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4256x2389+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2Fb3%2F8b1362614514888ada07852d59e2%2Fdig-cst-0207-6.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francisco Magana, 6, and his father Roberto Magana dig their vehicle out on Leavitt near Cullerton Street on February 6, 2011, following the Groundhog Day blizzard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard A.

Snow removal services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve learned a hard lesson in life with the snow business,” said John Geroulis, owner of Snow America Inc., which offers snow removal services to around 200 businesses and HOAs in Chicago. “When it snows, you make money. When it doesn’t, you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low-snow winter definitely has an effect on Geroulis’ economics. He said he made some changes to his business a few years ago after he noticed a worrying trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was like, ‘Wow, the winters aren’t like when I first started in the ‘70s,’” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geroulis now uses a pair of strategies to combat low-snow winters. The first is offering two types of contracts: one that charges per snow and another that charges a flat fee every month and is signed by customers before the winter begins. His second strategy is diversification — he also owns a construction company and employs the same workers for each business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know of any competitor that’s focused just on snow, personally,” Geroulis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re wondering how the city of Chicago handles snow, the Department of Streets and Sanitation operates its own fleet of snow plows and salt spreaders. They only use outsourced help from private companies when things get really bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did it six years ago, when we got literally a season’s worth of snow in three weeks,” said Chicago Streets and Sanitation Commissioner Cole Stallard. “It’s safety. The streets have to be safe and passable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for restaurant and entertainment sectors, incremental city restaurant tax and amusement tax data was not available for this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you notice that you tend to shop in person or dine out more during unseasonably warm winter days, research suggests those short-term bursts do not have a long-term effect on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-fc0000\" name=\"image-fc0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/995e585/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+501/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2Fdc%2Ff1165b8643f49bcb947f098f5c60%2F1-23-podgo-weather-6x.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/90daaf1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+501/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2Fdc%2Ff1165b8643f49bcb947f098f5c60%2F1-23-podgo-weather-6x.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9e70d35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+501/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2Fdc%2Ff1165b8643f49bcb947f098f5c60%2F1-23-podgo-weather-6x.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"1-23 podgo weather 6x.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9e70d35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+501/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2Fdc%2Ff1165b8643f49bcb947f098f5c60%2F1-23-podgo-weather-6x.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b94bf35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+501/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2Fdc%2Ff1165b8643f49bcb947f098f5c60%2F1-23-podgo-weather-6x.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9e70d35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+501/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2Fdc%2Ff1165b8643f49bcb947f098f5c60%2F1-23-podgo-weather-6x.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tennis anyone?

On a day like this, consumers may be more likely to go out and spend some money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2025/09/estimating-national-weather-effects-from-the-ground-up/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;research paper published last year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by economist Daniel Wilson with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, short-term granular shocks in weather have a statistically significant economic impact on retail, leisure and hospitality, but the impact is temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper argues that “favorable weather stimulates retail activity in the short-run” but with a big caveat: “[L]ocal weather shocks have only short-lived impacts on local economic activity.” In fact, the positive economic effects of favorable weather will rebound in the months that follow. “After an initial shock, the granular weather effects respond in the opposite direction for the following two months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, consumers who spent their discretionary money during a warm weekend in February are less likely to have discretionary income to spend during a warm weekend in March. They have pulled forward their discretionary spending; the following month, they will do less of that activity, regardless of the weather, according to this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concept works in the reverse as well: If you spent very little during this winter’s polar vortex, you might have responded by spending more over the unseasonably warm Valentine’s Day weekend. That means the short-term effect of a mild winter is exactly that: short-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The lagged effects [of selected weather variables] typically offset the contemporaneous effects, leading to near-zero cumulative effects after 3 to 4 months,” according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-1c0000\" name=\"image-1c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/496c6d5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3a%2F61%2F7376d7414993890a4053ec4f53d3%2Fweather-260217-6.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/80a207e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3a%2F61%2F7376d7414993890a4053ec4f53d3%2Fweather-260217-6.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1020085/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3a%2F61%2F7376d7414993890a4053ec4f53d3%2Fweather-260217-6.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"WEATHER_260217-6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1020085/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3a%2F61%2F7376d7414993890a4053ec4f53d3%2Fweather-260217-6.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3ef1cfd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3a%2F61%2F7376d7414993890a4053ec4f53d3%2Fweather-260217-6.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1020085/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3a%2F61%2F7376d7414993890a4053ec4f53d3%2Fweather-260217-6.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groups of people enjoy the record breaking warm weather along the Lakefront trail near Belmont Harbor, Monday, Feb. 16, 2026 | Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the longer term, a region’s climate is one of many variables that affect where people live and work, according to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/working-papers/2023/07/climate-change-and-the-geography-of-the-u-s-economy/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;another paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; co-written by Wilson in 2023 that aimed to predict how climate change would affect the national economy. “Using county-level weather projections based on alternative greenhouse gas emissions scenarios,” that paper projected “substantial reallocations of people and jobs across the country over the next three decades.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An increase in extreme weather could be a variable that breaks the decades-long population trend toward the nation’s Sun Belt region, according to that paper. It projected that population and employment are likely to shift away from the Sun Belt and toward the North and Mountain West in the next 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What that means for Chicago’s economy remains to be seen, but it is sure to lead to adaptation. For John Geroulis of Snow America, he’s long thought of the snow removal business as recession-proof. But he won’t be surprised if Chicago’s changing climate means his business will have to adapt again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can completely see, in the next three to five years, not even offering a per-occurrence or per-push contract and just offering only a seasonal per-month contract to everybody, for that only reason,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Justin Bull is a producer with Curious City.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-750000\" name=\"html-embed-module-750000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=\"https://modules.wearehearken.com/wbez/embed/4190.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Figueroa, 28, lying in the street, according to a police report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montoya Perry, 33, is scheduled for a detention hearing later Wednesday at the Leighton Criminal Court building, charged with murder and vehicular hijacking in the death of Figueroa, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figueroa, 28, was in the 5500 block of West Flournoy Street when &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2026/02/23/death-of-downers-grove-man-found-on-austin-street-probed-as-homicide-police-say\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;he was attacked about 2:10 a.m. Monday, police said.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loretto Hospital staffers told police Figueroa left the building after making the food delivery and police discovered video that showed three people walking to Figueroa's van which was parked in the turnaround of the hospital, according to the report. The video then showed Figueroa spotting someone trying to take his van, causing him to jump onto the passage side door, according to the report, which said he was \"dragged approximately half a block.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figueroa, of the west suburbs, was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 2:46 a.m., according to the Cook County medical examiner's office. A cause and manner of his death was not immediately known. An autopsy Tuesday was inconclusive and pending further studies, the office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re incredibly saddened by this tragic loss, and our thoughts are with their family and loved ones as they navigate this unimaginably difficult time,\" an emailed statement from Uber said. \"We’ve reached out to police and will assist them however we can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a spokesperson for Loretto Hospital said it was aware of the \"tragic incident\" and that hospital officials are fully cooperating with local law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"On behalf of Loretto Hospital, our prayers and condolences go out to the individual’s family and loved ones,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our focus remains on supporting the safety, health, and well-being of the community we serve during this difficult time.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Trump’s \"Operation Midway Blitz\" sat as guests in the U.S. House chamber, the president declared the country was in a \"golden age\" and boasted about border security, tax cuts and his targeted enforcement of those who lack legal status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/b&gt;: During his nearly two-hour speech, Trump bashed the U.S. Supreme Court — with four justices in attendance — and promised to ignore the high court's ruling last week striking down his tariffs. He said tariffs could replace income taxes, though that is not a serious policy proposal. He also claimed to have brought down grocery prices, which &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-i-wjtltdd-l-k/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;is not the case in Chicago&lt;/a&gt;.

Ilan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich) both shouted at Trump from their seats, as Trump talked about illegal immigration and doubled down on attacking so-called Democratic sanctuary cities, including Chicago. U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, a Democrat from Naperville, left the chamber during the speech. So did Rep. Al Green (D-Texas). Sen. Tammy Duckworth and U.S. Reps. Mike Quigley, Sean Casten, Delia Ramirez, Jan Schakowsky and Eric Sorensen boycotted the address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Local guests&lt;/b&gt;: U.S. Rep.

Sullivan’s Feb. 19 ruling also wipes out $93.8 million in fines and fees not yet collected.

That led to 48 hours of lockdowns and uncertainty. Mexico deployed thousands of troops to quell clashes sparked by the killing, which left more than 70 people dead, according to the Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chicagoan's POV&lt;/b&gt;: Beckie Menzie landed in Puerto Vallarta on Saturday night, ready for a week of teaching music to eager students.

He’s also surely aware that Mack, the mother of his nearly 11-year-old child, is already &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024/1/17/24039349/heather-mack-gets-26-years-in-federal-prison-for-the-murder-of-her-mother-in-bali\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;serving a 26-year sentence&lt;/a&gt; in the Federal Bureau of Prisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s in addition to seven years Mack spent imprisoned in Indonesia. Schaefer served more than 11 years there before being released and deported from the country&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;this month, according to media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mack, now 30, likely has roughly 18 years to serve before she’ll be released in her late 40s. Schaefer’s cousin, Robert Bibbs, also served prison time for his role in the conspiracy.

In all, it took 26 months for her U.S. prosecution to play out once she landed at O’Hare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mack apologized to her mother’s siblings during her January 2024 sentencing. She also said she loved and missed von Wiese-Mack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think of her,” Mack said. “I miss her smile, her ‘I love yous,’ and mostly her holding me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024/1/11/24032878/heather-mack-bali-suitcase-murder-feds-prison-sentence-28-years\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;documented a long history of violence&lt;/a&gt; in the Mack home before the murder — how Mack allegedly bit her mother, shoved her to the ground so hard that von Wiese-Mack broke her arm, and at one point went around their home breaking plates and picture frames during an argument over household chores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mack broached the idea of killing her mother with Schaefer as early as February 2014, the feds say. Schaefer wrote in a Facebook chat that month, “that b---- heather is crazy” and added “she asked me to find someone to kill her mom for 50k.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feds say Mack ultimately enlisted Schaefer, secretly booking a $12,000 plane ticket for him so he could rendezvous with her while she vacationed with her mother in Bali in August 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2015/9/24/18424089/heather-mack-traded-giddy-tense-texts-with-boyfriend-before-mom-s-murder\"   &gt;Heather Mack traded giddy, tense texts with boyfriend before mom’s murder&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then, over the course of nearly 40 minutes on the morning of Aug. 12, 2014, prosecutors say Mack and Schaefer exchanged tense, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2015/9/24/18424089/heather-mack-traded-giddy-tense-texts-with-boyfriend-before-mom-s-murder\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;excited text messages&lt;/a&gt; as they prepared to murder von Wiese-Mack. They allegedly used the phrase “saying hi” as code for the killing, and they referred to each other as Bonnie and Clyde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after, prosecutors say, von Wiese-Mack “was brutally beaten after being taken by surprise as she lay in her hotel bed.” Mack’s plea agreement alleged that Schaefer “repeatedly beat Von Wiese in the head and face,” ending her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors once alleged that Mack &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/12/5/23495745/heather-mack-was-directly-involved-in-mothers-murder-should-stay-in-jail-feds\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;covered her mother’s mouth&lt;/a&gt; with her hand during the killing, but Mack did not admit to it in court.&lt;/p&gt;",

He was 84. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson is a Chicago icon known for his work as a civil rights leader. \"All are welcome\" for services scheduled this week, according to his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When are services?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson will lie in repose &lt;b&gt;Thursday &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Friday&lt;/b&gt;, at Rainbow PUSH's Kenwood headquarters at 930 E. 50th St. The services both days will start at 10 a.m. Doors will close to the public and media at 9 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service dates were adjusted after officials in South Carolina and Washington, D.C., offered to memorialize him there as well, so his remains will be traveling between Sunday and March 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;b&gt;March 2&lt;/b&gt;, a full day of recognition will take place at and near the South Carolina state capitol, according to communications from Rainbow PUSH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson will lie in repose at the Statehouse in Columbia before private, public and church services take place throughout the day. The services will be held from 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 1100 Gervais St., Columbia, S.C., 29208. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;b&gt;March 4&lt;/b&gt;, a formal service will take place in Washington, D.C.

Jesse Jackson and the life that he lived, to these homegoing services. They come respectful and come to say thank you,\" Jesse Jackson Jr. said during a media event in front of the Jackson family home. \"But these homegoing services are welcome to all — Democrat, Republican, liberal and conservative, right wing, left wing, because his life is broad enough to cover the full spectrum of what it means to be an American.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family will livestream all services at JesseJacksonLegacy.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What hotels are recommended for those traveling to Chicago for the events?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those traveling to Chicago to attend services are encouraged to stay at the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place Chicago at 2233 S. Martin Luther King Drive, according to the family's website. Rooms at the hotel have been reserved within a hotel block, with limited availability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where can people park?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those hoping to attend the Jackson lying in state events, street parking is available at Rainbow PUSH on South Drexel Boulevard, East 49th Street, East Hyde Park Boulevard and East 49th Street. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the People's Celebration, parking will be available at House of Hope's parking lot on 113th Street. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What security measures will be in place?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At each event, security checks and magnetometers will be in place. The family's website asks that individuals limit items brought to smooth the process.

In 2015,&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2017/11/17/18375473/rev-jesse-jackson-announces-parkinson-s-diagnosis\"   &gt; Jackson was initially diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, but he revealed last April that he actually had progressive supranuclear palsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How is the political world reacting to his death?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political figures from across the country have weighed in to pay their respects and honor his legacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement, former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama wrote: \"Michelle and I will always be grateful for Jesse's lifetime of service, and the friendship our families share. We stood on his shoulders. We send our deepest condolences to the Jackson family and everyone in Chicago and beyond who knew and loved him.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump also extended his sympathies to Jackson's family in a statement posted to Truth Social last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I knew him well, long before becoming President,\" he said. \"He was very gregarious — Someone who truly loved people! Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago leaders, including Mayor Brandon Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker, also shared their condolences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"In honor of Rev. Jackson's service, and as our city mourns, the Chicago flag will lower to half-staff,\" Mayor Johnson wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker also ordered all flags across the state to fly at half-mast to honor him in a statement posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He broke down barriers, inspired generations, and kept hope alive. Our state, nation, and world are better due to his years of service,\" Pritzker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How are Chicagoans reacting to his death?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the city, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2026/02/17/jesse-jackson-chicago-remembers\"   &gt;Chicago residents mourned Jackson’s death&lt;/a&gt; and urged that his legacy continue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Travis, a congregant of Apostolic Church of God in Woodlawn, said in his youth, his parents brought him to demonstrations organized by Operation Breadbasket, a movement Jackson led. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, 64, Travis remembers Jackson as \"instrumental in fighting for justice and freedom for all people.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chloe Gould, 41, a Bronzeville resident, said that his death hit \"like you lost a family member.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of his death, she said she worries about the future of civil rights activism, as other activists and leaders have not stepped in to fill his shoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Who is gonna be the civil rights activist now?\" she asked. &lt;/p&gt;",

He said an award of this size can help attract additional investors and funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Lawndale, at the corner of South Springfield Avenue and West Cermak Road, will be a first-of-its-kind sports complex for the West Side. The $38 million indoor sports and recreation center will allow for year-round sports, with two indoor turf fields, six full-size basketball courts, a boxing and fitness room, wrestling studio, multipurpose room, concessions and bar area and a pro shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sports leagues, mentoring programs and other initiatives will be helmed by Black- and Latino-led partners from both North Lawndale and Little Village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One goal of the Thriving Youth, Stronger Communities initiative is to create safe spaces for youth to aid in violence prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Townsell believes One Lawndale will achieve that as it will also offer nutrition, mental health and mentoring programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think that some of the best violence prevention work that you can do is work with young people before they get engaged in behavior out of boredom or having nothing else really to do,” Townsell said. “For us to be able to have something like this in the neighborhood that is high quality and that has all of the other supports necessary, we think it's going to be the best violence prevention and community building effort.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lohengrin Foundation is helping the developer find other foundation partners to close its funding gap, Townsell said. It hopes to start construction in late summer or early fall. Completion is slated for fall or winter of 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erie Neighborhood House will use its $5 million award toward the La Villita Erie House Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The social services nonprofit has been in Little Village for about 20 years. It currently rents a building in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Villita Erie House, 2653-59 S. Kildare Ave., will allow the nonprofit to grow its footprint in the neighborhood — both in the number of people it serves and into a larger, permanent space. The five-story building will have spaces for children, teens and other community members, with the final concept shaped by community input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-ee0000\" name=\"image-ee0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c26a07f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/9281x5209+145+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb4%2Fdf%2F963afe6649edbc84e5682a44ca87%2Ferie-neighborhood-house-center.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f4e539e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/9281x5209+145+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb4%2Fdf%2F963afe6649edbc84e5682a44ca87%2Ferie-neighborhood-house-center.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8b1d8b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/9281x5209+145+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb4%2Fdf%2F963afe6649edbc84e5682a44ca87%2Ferie-neighborhood-house-center.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Rendering of La Villita Erie House\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8b1d8b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/9281x5209+145+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb4%2Fdf%2F963afe6649edbc84e5682a44ca87%2Ferie-neighborhood-house-center.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5e12972/2147483647/strip/true/crop/9281x5209+145+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb4%2Fdf%2F963afe6649edbc84e5682a44ca87%2Ferie-neighborhood-house-center.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8b1d8b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/9281x5209+145+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb4%2Fdf%2F963afe6649edbc84e5682a44ca87%2Ferie-neighborhood-house-center.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rendering of La Villita Erie House&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provided by Lohengrin Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cristina De La Rosa, executive director of Erie Neighborhood House, said community members have continuously expressed a need for safety. The nonprofit hosted focus groups and distributed surveys to hear more from community members about what a safe space for residents would look like and what sort of programming they’d like to see at the new center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to be really intentional,” De La Rosa said. “We really wanted to make sure that when people walk into the building, they felt like they could see themselves there — that it was designed for them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a center with a full-size gymnasium, flexible classrooms, an arts studio, private counseling and therapy offices, teen and tech lounges, community kitchen, outdoor green spaces, rooftop playground and children’s garden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erie Neighborhood House already offers a suite of youth programming, but the new center will allow the organization to offer full-day after school programming, De La Rosa said. And in the summer, school-aged children can stay during the week and receive breakfast, lunch and a snack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erie Neighborhood House hopes to break ground this fall and open within a year of its groundbreaking. The $22 million project will expand opportunities for the nonprofit to partner with other organizations in the area — like One Lawndale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don't see this as two separate neighborhoods,” Townsell said of North Lawndale and Little Village. “We see this as one Lawndale and folks coming together around supporting young people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez said the foundation didn’t intend to choose two winners, let alone two from adjacent neighborhoods. But the award is helping to connect both projects with possible capital partners, doubling its intended impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Lawndale and Little Village have higher numbers of youth and youth violence, according to the foundation. The number of youth the projects would serve, along with each project's feasibility, helped elevate the two proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were more than 70 submissions for Thriving Youth, Stronger Communities, which showcases the excitement in supporting youth communities, Rodriguez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's no limit on the ideas or the need. It's only a limit on the resources that are available,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;",

One guy in the history of the league was lethal at that and his first was Dirk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matas Buzelis is no Dirk Nowitzki. Maybe someday, but nowhere near that yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Donovan wants Buzelis using his ball-handling to either attack the rim or thrust an opposing defender back, going to the mid-range if he can create that space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sample size was just one game – a blowout loss to Charlotte on Wednesday – but Buzelis finished with a career-high 32 points on 13-of-19 shooting. He was 6-of-11 from three, but also took two mid-range shots, going 1-for-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both were Donovan approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He got into the paint area and made some shots, got to the basket and made some drives,” Donovan said of Buzelis’ night. “That’s what he’s got to do, play more off the dribble to score. I thought he was very efficient and decisive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you look at the really good offensive players and scorers in this league, they are hard to guard because you really are not sure what they are going to do. Go by you, step back, shoot a three, shot fake. It’s hard to handle those high-level offensive players. I’ve talked to Matas. He has to be shiftier and craftier with the basketball.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baby steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buzelis acknowledged the talk with Donovan but didn’t feel the need to detail it. His game against the Hornets was his statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was also nice was the seven rebounds and even two assists from Buzelis. On a sinking ship that is the 2025-26 season, Buzelis can still be that defiant waving flag in all its glory hanging off the stern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s just not in the mindset to focus on that. A 10-game losing streak will do that to a man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to be what the team needs me to be,” Buzelis said. “If that’s scoring, that’s what it’s going to be. I try to figure out during the game what the team needs and (Tuesday) it was scoring. But look at (Detroit point guard) Cade Cunningham the other day (in a blowout win over the Bulls). He was dimeing (making pinpoint passes). That’s what winners do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, however, is not where the Bulls currently reside. With 23 games left, Buzelis should be focused on continuing his development, shot profile, and making winning plays, but for a losing product. Not an easy sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The trades happened,” Buzelis said of the roster turnover at the trade deadline. “When you trade half the team and bring in new guys, it’s tough. But it’s no excuse. When we control the things we can control, we are going to be a great team. Billy always says you get 10 guys who are on the same page and ready to fight and you can win anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nice thought but just not reality.

Los demócratas permanecieron sentados, algunos moviendo la cabeza, mientras que los republicanos se levantaron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los representantes Ilan Omar, demócrata por Minnesota, y Rashida Tlaib, demócrata por Michigan, gritaron a Trump desde sus asientos, mientras él hablaba sobre la inmigración ilegal y se reafirmaba en su ataque contra las denominadas ciudades santuario del Partido Demócrata, incluyendo Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-d50000\" name=\"module-d50000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“También les pido que terminen con las mortales ciudades santuario que protegen a los criminales y que impongan serias sanciones a los funcionarios públicos que bloqueen la deportación de inmigrantes criminales, en muchos casos, capos de drogas, asesinos en todo nuestro país”, dijo Trump. “Están bloqueando la deportación de estas personas de nuestro país, y deberían sentirse avergonzados”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y a pesar de haber tomado medidas para restringir la entrada de personas al país, a menudo en nombre de proteger la seguridad nacional, Trump habló sobre dejar entrar a las personas en el país “legalmente”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Siempre permitiremos que las personas entren legalmente”, agregó Trump. “Personas que amarán a nuestro país y trabajarán arduamente para mantenerlo”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los comentarios de Trump sobre sus medidas de inmigración se dieron cuando el representante Jesús “Chuy” García llevó a Marimar Martínez, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2026/02/04/marimar-martinez-baleada-por-agentes-de-migracion-se-pronuncia-contra-asesinatos\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;una mujer a la que agentes de la Patrulla Fronteriza le dispararon cinco veces&lt;/a&gt;, como su invitada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El representante Raja Krishnamoorthi llevó como invitado al &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2026/02/25/estudiante-de-uic-asiste-al-estado-de-la-union-tras-la-deportacion-de-su-padre\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;estudiante de la Universidad de Illinois en Chicago, Jaime Coria Jr, cuyo padre fue detenido&lt;/a&gt; por agentes federales durante el clímax del Operativo Midway Blitz y enviado a más de 2,000 millas de distancia a la Ciudad de México.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;García publicó una foto de Martínez en su cuenta de X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mientras su propio gobierno sigue desacreditando su nombre, estoy orgulloso de su valentía al compartir su historia —y orgulloso de tenerla como mi invitada en el SOTU (Discurso sobre el Estado de la Unión)”, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://x.com/RepChuyGarcia/status/2026485393734951227?s=20\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;escribió García&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Marimar Martinez—shot five times by a CBP agent, who later bragged about it—is in the House chambers for the State of the Union.&lt;br&gt;As her own government continues to smear her name, I’m proud of her courage in sharing her story—and proud to have her as my guest at the SOTU. &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/UM163kS9DW\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UM163kS9DW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Congressman Chuy García (@RepChuyGarcia) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepChuyGarcia/status/2026485393734951227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 25, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;La representante Lauren Underwood, demócrata por Naperville, la jefa de la campaña de reclutamiento de candidatos de los demócratas de la Cámara, abandonó la cámara durante el discurso de Trump. Underwood sacudió la cabeza mientras se levantaba para irse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La demócrata de Illinois se despidió de algunas de sus colegas mujeres demócratas. Las mujeres, que llevaban vestimenta blanca en homenaje al movimiento sufragista, intercambiaron risas antes de que Underwood saliera rápidamente por la parte trasera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;También lo hizo el representante Al Green, demócrata por Texas, quien fue escoltado por seguridad tras sostener un letrero que decía “Las personas negras no son simios”, que le fue quitado por el líder de la mayoría en la Cámara, Steve Scalise. Esto se refirió a un video &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2026/02/06/donald-trump-racist-video-barack-michelle-obama-depiction-primates\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;racista&lt;/a&gt; que Trump compartió a principios de mes que incluía una representación del expresidente Barack Obama y Michelle Obama como simios en una jungla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La senadora Tammy Duckworth, junto con los representantes Mike Quigley, Sean Casten, Delia Ramírez, Jan Schakowsky y Eric Sorensen, boicotearon el discurso anual, con Duckworth calificándolo el lunes como “otro mitin de campaña lleno de mentiras”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"La madre de un ángel\", Jacqueline Medina, fue una de las muchas invitadas que Trump trajo al discurso. La hija de Medina, Lizbeth, fue supuestamente asesinada por un hombre mexicano que carecía de estatus legal en diciembre de 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Su madre destrozada está en la galería para recordarle a todos en esta cámara exactamente por qué estamos deportando a los criminales inmigrantes ilegales en números récord,” dijo Trump entre aplausos de los republicanos. “Y los estamos sacando de aquí rápido”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antes de la retórica política, Trump trató de pintar un panorama optimista sobre sus logros del primer año —y las bajas calificaciones de aprobación— antes de las elecciones de medio término de noviembre. El presidente alabó los aranceles generalizados y lamentó la decisión de la Corte Suprema que los anuló, calificándola de “desafortunada”, mientras la cámara mostraba a los jueces de la Corte Suprema en el recinto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Está salvando a nuestro país”, dijo Trump sobre los aranceles, mientras también los calificaba de “protectores de la paz”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El presidente presentó al equipo olímpico ganador de la medalla de oro del hockey sobre hielo masculino en la Cámara, recibiendo aplausos, y anunció que otorgará la Medalla Presidencial de la Libertad al portero del equipo, Connor Hellebuyck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump recibió una ovación poco común de algunos demócratas, incluyendo la senadora Elizabeth Warren, demócrata por Massachusetts, cuando dijo que deseaba que el Congreso aprobara una medida para detener el comercio de acciones con información privilegiada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Con información de AP\n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

For more than 25 years, the group’s high-spirited gypsy-punk rock has been a cultural bridge, built from the musical touchstones of Eastern Europe, Russia, Latin and South America and the Lower East Side of New York where the band first sprouted in 1999. But that message has never been stronger than right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This song is about the journey of where I’m from to where she’s from,” front man Eugene Hütz said Tuesday at Concord Music Hall, introducing the new track, “From Boyarka To Boyaca.” It was co-written and performed with tour opener Puzzled Panther, the title referencing the nearly identical names of Hütz’s hometown of Boyarka, Ukraine, as well as Boyaca, Colombia, where Puzzled Panther’s Victoria Espinoza hails from, illuminating how similar we all are — even worlds away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the two bands crowded the stage, nearly tripping over each other as they pogoed along to the rhythm, a few fans in the crowd held up a large blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag that came in the eyesight of Hütz who nodded at the sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f30000\" name=\"image-f30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/90adc72/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5042x2830+0+267/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fed%2F9e%2F37c641ad4fb1862dc0fae1e5bab9%2Fgogol-2602261206.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/46b74a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5042x2830+0+267/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fed%2F9e%2F37c641ad4fb1862dc0fae1e5bab9%2Fgogol-2602261206.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/237f87c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5042x2830+0+267/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fed%2F9e%2F37c641ad4fb1862dc0fae1e5bab9%2Fgogol-2602261206.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Eugene Hütz of Gogol Bordello performs at the Concord Music Hall in the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago on February 24, 2026. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/237f87c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5042x2830+0+267/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fed%2F9e%2F37c641ad4fb1862dc0fae1e5bab9%2Fgogol-2602261206.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d9ebde/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5042x2830+0+267/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fed%2F9e%2F37c641ad4fb1862dc0fae1e5bab9%2Fgogol-2602261206.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/237f87c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5042x2830+0+267/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fed%2F9e%2F37c641ad4fb1862dc0fae1e5bab9%2Fgogol-2602261206.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eugene Hütz of Gogol Bordello performs Tuesday at Concord Music Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manuel Martinez/WBEZ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday night marked the fourth anniversary of when Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and Hütz has never forgotten it. For years, he has stood up for his people and raised money for victims and soldiers of the war via benefit concerts and secret shows, including a performance at the World Forum for Democracy in Strasbourg in November. Gogol Bordello also recorded a cover of Angelic Upstarts’ “Solidarity” with Joy Division/New Order’s Bernard Sumner with lyrics reframed as a tribute to the people of Ukraine. It’s included on Gogol Bordello’s latest album, “We Mean It, Man!” released Feb. 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in honor of the anniversary, the band diverted from its standard tour track list on Tuesday to include “Solidarity” as the final song in the encore, with Hütz dedicating it to “our brothers and sisters of Ukraine” before unfurling powerful lyrics like, “In unity there is each other and your friend becomes your brother, and the tyrant will never have its way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Political messages continued throughout the night — before a defiant performance of “Immigraniada (We Comin' Rougher),” percussionist and MC Pedro Erazo had some words to share. “Every day we see police brutality and the destruction of humanity when what we need is peace, love and unity,” he said, adding, “f--- ICE and f--- Trump.” Hütz also took a moment to explain the meaning of the new song, “No Time For Idiots” in the “academic part of the night.” As he noted, the English word idiot comes from ancient Greece and was simply a name for a layperson who is not involved in any politics or public affairs. “I got no f---ing time for that!” he declared. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f00000\" name=\"image-f00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/993715b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6776x3803+0+359/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2F2c%2F6dae2d964cf4ab342179c24755bf%2Fgogol-2602260919.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70605e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6776x3803+0+359/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2F2c%2F6dae2d964cf4ab342179c24755bf%2Fgogol-2602260919.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6de953c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6776x3803+0+359/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2F2c%2F6dae2d964cf4ab342179c24755bf%2Fgogol-2602260919.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Gogol Bordello played to a sold-out audience at the Concord Music Hall in the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago on February 24, 2026. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6de953c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6776x3803+0+359/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2F2c%2F6dae2d964cf4ab342179c24755bf%2Fgogol-2602260919.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b2b70bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6776x3803+0+359/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2F2c%2F6dae2d964cf4ab342179c24755bf%2Fgogol-2602260919.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6de953c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6776x3803+0+359/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7b%2F2c%2F6dae2d964cf4ab342179c24755bf%2Fgogol-2602260919.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erica Mancini and Gil Alexandre of Gogol Bordello perform Tuesday at Concord Music Hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manuel Martinez/WBEZ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hütz had also brandished his own blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag during the night during the optimist chant of “Life Is Possible Again.” The song is one of the most uplifting numbers on “We Mean It, Man!” and is polished with electronic synths and a futuristic vibe that is carried throughout the new album.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the centuries-old music traditions it borrows from, Gogol Bordello uses music as a coping mechanism in times of strife, and the band still wants you to dance and have fun. It’s an easy ask. Decked out in sequins and leopard prints, the lively-as-ever seven-piece ensemble was ready to party and invited the sold-out room to join them for two hours as they sloshed beer cans, galloped around the stage and coaxed the “choir” on the floor to add to the vocal hooting and hollering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who had no idea who Gogol Bordello was and happened to walk into Concord Music Hall might’ve mistaken it for a raucous wedding party with violins and accordions flailing and varied percussion creating a beat that the onlookers in the crowd took to. On fan favorites like bar song “Alcohol” and the feisty “Fire On Ice Floe,” many broke out in jigs and healthy circle pits, swaying arms and stomping their feet on the floor so forcefully that it felt like it could give way at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; There’s a reason this band often plays Riot Fest — you almost need the wide outdoor space at Douglass Park to provide ample room for people to fully feel the music. In fact, the band’s “very good friend” Riot Mike (aka fest founder Mike Petryshyn) was in the crowd Tuesday. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gogol Bordello may hail from New York (and its members from all over the world), but its heart has long been in Chicago, and the band made sure to make that fully known on this local tour stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a great history with this city,” Hütz shared, noting that accordionist Erica Mancini is a Chicago native before shouting out Steve Albini with whom the band made the landmark album, “Gypsy Punks: Underdog World Strike” in 2005. That record dominated much of the set list, from the traditional gypsy style of “Mishto!” to the band’s breakaway hit “Start Wearing Purple” that riled everyone up before the encore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Hütz ended the show by inviting all bands out on stage and introducing the nations where each hailed from, it was a powerful message of why immigrants matter and what harmony can be made when we all come together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gogol Bordello set list Feb. 24 at Concord Music Hall&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ignition&lt;br&gt;I Would Never Wanna Be Young Again&lt;br&gt;Not A Crime&lt;br&gt;Immigrant Punk&lt;br&gt;Wonderlust King&lt;br&gt;My Companjera&lt;br&gt;Fire On Ice Floe (with Puzzled Panther)&lt;br&gt;From Boyarka To Boyaca (with Puzzled Panther)&lt;br&gt;Mystics&lt;br&gt;No Time For Idiots&lt;br&gt;Immigraniada (We Comin' Rougher)&lt;br&gt;We Mean It, Man!&lt;br&gt;Life Is Possible Again&lt;br&gt;Mishto!&lt;br&gt;Start Wearing Purple&lt;br&gt;Pala Tute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encore&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alcohol&lt;br&gt;Boiling Point&lt;br&gt;Solidarity&lt;/p&gt;",

Austin’s surgery was one of three injury updates Counsell provided Wednesday. In addition, left-hander &lt;b&gt;Jordan Wicks&lt;/b&gt; has been dealing with inflammation in his left forearm, and first baseman &lt;b&gt;Jonathon Long&lt;/b&gt;’s recovery from a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/21/how-tokyo-series-prepared-cubs-matthew-boyd-for-wbc-ramp-up\"   &gt;sprained left elbow&lt;/a&gt; has slowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Austin,&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/01/08/how-cubs-tyler-austin-made-his-mlb-comeback-after-six-seasons-in-japan\"   &gt; after landing a split contract and 40-man roster spot with the Cubs this offseason&lt;/a&gt;, entered camp with an “inside track,” as Counsell put it, to breaking camp with the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former top Yankees prospect, Austin is aiming to return to MLB this season after six seasons in Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball. His signing provided a right-handed bat off the Cubs bench to pair with left-handed-hitting Michael Busch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, Busch was expected to get more at-bats against left-handed pitchers this season than in years past. Now, the Cubs’ depth behind him is thin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could they pursue an outside addition to address the loss?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You go through this exercise in spring training of backup plans on top of backup plans,” Counsell said. “And you just can't be covered ideally in every single situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long, who hit .305 in Triple-A last year, is a backup option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whether he's with the big-league team or whether he's in Triple-A, he's a day away,” Counsell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designated hitter and catcher Moisés Ballesteros is also expected to take reps at first base this spring. And the Cubs have a number of options in emergency situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Long’s decision&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long was originally scheduled to leave Tuesday to join Team Chinese Taipei for the World Baseball Classic, but he pushed back his travel date after spraining his left elbow in an in-game collision Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long’s latest injury update throws his availability for the tournament into question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Things are going a little more slowly, probably, on the recovery, than we'd all like,” Counsell said Wednesday. “So he has a WBC decision to make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wicks avoids worst case&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent MRI of Wicks’ throwing arm didn’t raise any concerns about the stability of his ulnar collateral ligament, Counsell said. The Cubs are still trying to find the exact source of Wicks’ discomfort, but the imaging results suggest he won’t need Tommy John surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wicks has taken the last five days off of throwing, Counsell said, and responded well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In terms of length of time down, we're probably still looking just at days down, not weeks,” Counsell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\"

Ambos se conectaron después de que el padre de Coria Jr. fuera detenido a principios de octubre cerca de su complejo de apartamentos en Mount Prospect, en el distrito congresional de Krishnamoorthi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Es la historia de una familia que estaba pasando por una tremenda adversidad”, dijo Krishnamoorthi. \"Donald Trump dice que iba tras lo peor de lo peor cuando asumió el cargo, y creo que la familia de Jaime realmente representa lo que ha terminado siendo el objetivo de los esfuerzos de Donald Trump: familias amorosas que intentan sobrevivir... y ahora él las ha separado”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El padre de Coria Jr. pasó cuatro días en condiciones “inhumanas” en el centro de procesamiento del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) en Broadview, un suburbio al oeste, antes de autodeportarse a México, donde está trabajando a tiempo completo y viviendo en la casa de su infancia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fue metido en una sala sin ventanas con aproximadamente 60 hombres, se le negaron duchas, se le obligó a dormir en el suelo o a mantenerse de pie y fue testigo de cómo varios detenidos fueron sacados en camillas, según Krishnamoorthi. Firmó un formulario de salida voluntaria y fue deportado al día siguiente, aunque su abogado consiguió una audiencia de emergencia que podría haber detenido su remoción.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Él decidió, prácticamente, renunciar a sus derechos”, contó Coria Jr. “En ese momento, no le hicieron saber sus opciones legales”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnamoorthi inspeccionó la instalación de Broadview en diciembre, después de que se negaran intentos anteriores, y dijo que el edificio “no estaba diseñado de ninguna manera para albergar personas”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lo que muestra es que si no hay supervisión, suceden cosas malas. Y cosas malas estaban sucediendo en Broadview... Así que esa es toda la razón de más para que personas como yo desempeñen funciones de supervisión”, compartió Krishnamoorthi. “Voy a plantarme ante ellos ocho días a la semana por lo que sucedió”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnamoorthi enfatizó que la historia de Coria Jr. destaca un patrón más amplio de detenidos que son “puestos en condiciones inhumanas, coaccionados a renunciar a sus derechos y privados del debido proceso”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menos de un mes después de que el padre de Coria Jr. se autodeportara, una corte ordenó la liberación de 615 detenidos en un intento de “restaurar el status quo que existía antes de que la administración de Trump cambiara recientemente su interpretación de la ley de inmigración”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al padre de Coria Jr. recientemente se le negó una visa de inmigración durante una cita en el Consulado de México, y el abogado de la familia está trabajando en una respuesta a esa negativa, dijo Coria Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;También señaló que su padre “rompe la agenda de la administración de Trump” sobre los inmigrantes. Pagó impuestos cada año durante aproximadamente dos décadas, nunca debió dinero al Servicio de Impuestos Interno (IRS), nunca votó en una elección y nunca recibió beneficios del gobierno.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El padre de Coria Jr. ha sido techador durante tres décadas y desempeñó un papel fundamental en ayudar a cuidar de su esposa durante 10 años mientras luchaba contra el colangiocarcinoma, un tipo raro de cáncer de hígado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El padre del universitario la llevó a la sala de emergencias en múltiples ocasiones y esperó hasta que ella se estabilizara antes de volver a su trabajo intensivo en mano de obra y regresar al hospital, quedándose toda la noche para asegurarse de que estaba bien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“El oncólogo de mi mamá incluso escribió una carta hablando sobre el carácter moral de mi papá”, agregó Coria Jr. “Él nunca se enojó conmigo ni con mis hermanas [y] siempre nos daba consejos”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coria Jr. insta a otros que tuvieron seres queridos detenidos en condiciones severas en Broadview a alzar la voz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“La forma en que tratamos a las personas no es algo que debería estar en debate”, agregó Coria Jr. “Nosotros como país deberíamos esperar un mejor trato para los inmigrantes en general”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Even in their heyday, they were only bringing in 60 million-plus viewers, and that’s been declining substantially for decades. They rarely result in a post-speech bump for any president, and according to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-state-of-the-union-doesnt-have-a-big-political-impact/#:~:text=Second%2C%20State%20of%20the%20Union,isn&amp;#x27;t%20very%20much).\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Gallup polling data&lt;/a&gt; since 1978, the average change in a president’s approval rating has been less than 1 percentage point in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, this is good news for Donald Trump. The president should hope and pray this State of the Union was lightly watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His speech was a chaotic cacophony of lies, bigotry, gaslighting and willful ignorance, painting the portrait of a man who has lost the country, and he knows it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Trump is confident about the state of the union, the health of the Republican Party and keeping the majority come November, his unhinged and delusional address belied that confidence. Instead, his cartoonish overcompensating for a disastrous first year only drove home the point that his administration is spiraling out of control and has no plans to change course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-200000\" name=\"module-200000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounding very much like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris — who, I’ll remind you, lost all seven swing states in 2024 — Trump bragged about a country and economy that most Americans don’t recognize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Our nation is back: bigger, better, richer and stronger than ever before,\" he declared. \"This is the golden age of America.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few Americans feel that way, however. Polls show Trump’s job &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/politics/article/poll-trumps-approval-rating-hits-new-low-as-immigration-backlash-grows-and-ice-withdraws-from-minnesota-204723473.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;approval&lt;/a&gt; is at an all-time low. Most Americans think Trump is moving the country in the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/23/trump-poll-state-of-the-union\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;wrong direction&lt;/a&gt;, and a plurality believes Trump is doing a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/12/trump-polling-approval-biden-democrats\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;worse job&lt;/a&gt; than Biden. Most think he’s focused on issues that aren’t very important to them, and a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2026/02/04/a-year-into-trumps-second-term-americans-views-of-the-economy-remain-negative/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;majority&lt;/a&gt; say they are very concerned about the cost of health care, food, consumer goods and housing. Less than a third of Americans &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2026/02/04/a-year-into-trumps-second-term-americans-views-of-the-economy-remain-negative/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; the economy will be better in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This anxiety over the economy and health of the country could not match Trump’s bombastic gloating any less. Americans are worried and frustrated and in no mood for Trump’s delusional victory laps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn’t fare much better on immigration, another one of Trump’s signature issues. In April of 2025, 48% of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of immigration. In the months following, which saw U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement surges in major cities, ugly confrontations with citizens, the unlawful detainment of several undocumented immigrants and the shocking deaths of two protesters, his approval has dipped to a low of 41%, with his disapproval skyrocketing to 55%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no acknowledgment of this or attempt at a course-correction in his speech, though. Instead, he played to the cheapest of seats with gory tales of violence by illegal drug lords, murderers and rapists — criminals no one has an issue with removing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, on tariffs, Trump told voters the sky was green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Everything was working well,\" before the Supreme Court shot them down, he insisted, and said that \"factories, jobs, investment and trillions and trillions of dollars will continue pouring into America\" because of those tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to independent estimates, his tariffs &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/politics/article/state-of-the-union-takeawa-050313481.html?guccounter=1\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;have cost&lt;/a&gt; U.S. households as much as $2,600 per year, and polls show a majority of Americans oppose them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, if he doesn’t want to listen to voters, that’s certainly his prerogative, and I imagine Democrats won’t get in his way. Republican lawmakers who are up in November, though, probably wish he’d start sounding different when he talked about the economic pain most Americans were feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they’d need a different president, one who isn’t delusional and totally unwilling to admit what most people can see and feel: The state of the union is bad, and Trump is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;S.E.

He would count as a $17.4 million cap hit next year if he's on the roster but take merely a $2.4 million dead cap charge if he's cut. He's entering the final year of his contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s a cut or a trade — the latter would net a Day 3 pick —&amp;nbsp;the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/24/bears-gm-ryan-poles-must-set-aside-attachment-as-he-eyes-potential-upgrades-to-roster\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Bears&lt;/a&gt; figure to make a move before the start of the league year March 11. He's due a $1 million roster bonus two days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bears general manager Ryan Poles was vague when asked about Edmunds' future Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There's a couple guys we've got to make decisions on,\" he said. \"You know, if that's trade, release, there's a lot of different options that … or few options that we can go down to create some space. But like I said before, this is a unique situation where we've gotten our roster in a position where we have a lot of talented players, a lot of guys getting paid well, and that puts some constraints on the cap. So we've got to make some tough decisions.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edmunds just finished his best season as a Bear, totaling four interceptions — the second-most of any linebacker in the NFL — and leading the team in tackles despite missing four games because of a groin injury. D’Marco Jackson was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week in his place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson is a pending free agent. Longtime starter T.J. Edwards is recovering from a broken leg and Noah Sewell, who started nine games last year, is rehabbing from a torn Achilles’ tendon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's some unknowns there,” Poles said. “There's some projections just in terms of return time. And then you want to know, is that athlete gonna return to be the same player he was before? Will they go downhill?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edmunds doesn't turn 28 until May and has a unique blend of height and athleticism for the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears need to get under the salary cap by the start of the league year. They could also restructure veteran contracts, though Poles has promised to be judicious with how much extra money he pushes into future years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No O-line shift&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears need a starting left tackle with Ozzy Trapilo expected to miss most of the season with a patellar tendon injury. Poles was clear Tuesday about what the Bears would not do to fill the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right tackle Darnell Wright isn’t switching to left tackle, he said. Joe Thuney will stay at left guard, too. He played well in a spot start at left tackle against the Rams but won the NFL’s first-ever Protector of the Year Award at his natural position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We like him at left guard,” Poles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The free agent tackle class isn’t considered a strong one, but it would get markedly better if the 49ers decide to cut star Trent Williams. The two are talking about an extension to lower his cap number for 2026 and 49ers GM John Lynch said this week they are “on the right track.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;London games&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jaguars will be the home team for two games in London —&amp;nbsp;one at Wembley Stadium and one at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium —&amp;nbsp; and the Commanders will play a home game at Tottenham. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NFL made the announcement Wednesday, one day after saying the Lions will be the home team for a game in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-bc0001\" name=\"list-bc0001\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, _styledTemplate=/page/list/PageListH.hbs, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, count=20487, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, carouselSpeed=null, buttonHoverBgColor=#a91d23, rteHeadingFont=font-1, secondaryColor=#656565, hideCategories=true, _template=/page/list/includes/PageList-header.hbs, font3=Arial, font4=Source-serif-4, ctaUrl=null, hideImage=false, suppressPagination=true, footerLinkHoverColor=#d3242c, hideAudioPlayback=false, description=[], showSecondItemMedia=false, listColumns234=null, footerTextColor=#ffffff, title=Latest on the Bears, pageCount=6829, headerSecondaryBgColor=#000000, primaryTextColorInverse=#ffffff, titleColor=null, ampLink=null, listHeaderPosition=null, pullQuoteIcon=[{image=null, narrowImage=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=null}], hideDescriptions=false, showActionBar=true, linkHoverColor=#d3242c, buttonBgColor=#d3242c, ctaTarget=null, anchorId=list-bc0001, promoButtonText=null, items=[{type=Image, anchorId=promo-700000, title=Bears GM Ryan Poles must set aside attachment as he eyes potential upgrades to roster, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, isFeatured=false, authors=[{jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Bears reporter]}], name=[{items=[Jason Lieser]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/jason-lieser, media=[{image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/db/45/4fa7d0e60b81cf16ace05e7c41e9/f5kj4hj-400x400-0.jpg, width=512, height=512}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/db/45/4fa7d0e60b81cf16ace05e7c41e9/f5kj4hj-400x400-0.jpg, width=512, height=512}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=Headshot of Chicago Bears reporter Jason Lieser}], bio=[{items=[Jason Lieser covers the Chicago Bears for the Chicago Sun-Times.]}]}], wordCount=872, description=[{items=[Nearly everyone should be up for evaluation, even some well-known names.

During the longest &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2026/02/24/president-donald-trump-state-of-the-union-speech-illinois-democrats-boycott\"   &gt;State of the Union&lt;/a&gt; address in history, he rambled a fusillade of falsehoods and superlatives. In the face of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2026/01/29/confidence-in-trump-dips-and-fewer-now-say-they-support-his-policies-and-plans/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;low approval ratings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he fell back on his media mastery — distractions, trumped-up narratives and delusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Our country is winning again. In fact, we're winning so much that we really don't know what to do about it. People are asking me, please, please, please, Mr. President, we're winning too much. We can't take it anymore,\" Trump said. He sounded like a casino carny. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We're not used to winning in our country. Until you came along, we were just always losing, but now we're winning too much. And I say no, no, no, you're going to win again. You're going to win big; you're going to win bigger than ever.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The golden age of America is here, he said. Because of his leadership, what once was a dead country a year ago is now the hottest. Spirit is restored alongside a stacked military and police force. Unfortunately, Trump’s insolence toward immigrants, and Somalis in particular, was on brand, as was his trash-talking or scolding of detractors. After a year in office, Trump said he ended eight wars, virtually stopped drugs from entering the United States and prevented \"illegal aliens\" from voting. He continued the lie of voter fraud and election cheating. Trump’s lying is normalized and cruel. The speech is what I expected. This is the nation in his mind’s eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-f80000\" name=\"module-f80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.politifact.com/article/2026/feb/25/Donald-trump-state-union-green/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Politifact&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an independent fact-checking newsroom, kept busy Tuesday night rating and debunking the president’s lies in real time. Politifact takes statements and provides clarity, context or call-outs. It’s an important piece of public service in our democracy, but in an oversaturated media landscape in which TikTok influencers are just as trusted as daily news reporters, facts get lost. If the president in all his authoritative hectoring describes low gas prices, that bluster can convince Americans that he must be right — despite what they see at the pump. Or at minimum, Trump sows confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, the mainstream media hesitated to use the word \"lie\" to describe Trump’s actions. Politifact founder Bill Adair pulls the curtain back in his 2024 book \"Beyond the Big Lie: The Epidemic of Political Lying, Why Republicans Do It More, and How It Could Burn Down Our Democracy.\" Early on, he recounts when he was asked by a caller on C-SPAN if he could say whether Democrats or Republicans lie more often. Adair knew the answer, but he lied because he wanted to show fairness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I, like most Washington journalists, was afraid Republicans would call me biased. My job was difficult enough because of the nature of fact-checking, a challenging job in which we declared what was true and what was false,\" he writes. To be fair, Democrats lie, too. Adair’s desire to appear fair did the opposite. While \"Beyond the Big Lie\" isn’t focused on Trump, Adair attempts to be a corrective to that C-SPAN caller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s lies are exhausting. During his State of the Union speech, he also bragged about lifting 2.4 million people out of food assistance when he actually kicked them off. While the president didn’t name-check Chicago, he asked lawmakers to \"end deadly sanctuary cities that protect the criminals and enact serious penalties for public officials who block the removal of criminal aliens, in many cases, drug lords, murderers all over our country\" — a clear dig at cities that welcome migrants and clear misinformation about who they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the nearly two-hour speech, the U.S.A. chants and awarding of medals tamped down. Trump painted the country in hues reminiscent of \"America the Beautiful\" lyrics. The emperor wore a red tie in the House Chamber. No mention of the recent deaths of people at the hands of masked federal agents under the guise of immigration enforcement; he treated the horrors in Minnesota and Illinois as ephemeral as Snapchat, but the Trump lies are as lasting as forever plastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it’s still a lie even if you believe it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Natalie Y.
