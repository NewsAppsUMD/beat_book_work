The Broncos hounded Butler and made every shot difficult for the Lynx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"One thing that always travels well is good defense,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Broncos bring that defensive tenacity into the state playoffs, the Broncos will be a formidable team going forward. You can project what seniors Danielle Brooks (16.3 points per game) and Darreyelle Smith (9.6 points and 7.7 rebounds) are going to bring. offensively. But it was the Broncos' supporting cast that was impressive on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freshman Janiah Daniel was impressive in her ability to attack the glass. She did a solid job of catching passes around the rim, and if she continues to improve as a finisher, she'll give the Broncos another offensive threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defending state champions open the IHSA Class 4A state playoffs against Lindblom on Monday, and if Kenwood wins, it would face Hinsdale Central on Thursday for the regional championship. The true showdown would come in a potential sectional semifinal matchup against Downers Grove North.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;IHSA State playoffs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;IHSA State playoffs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hinsdale Central sectional is stacked with competition. The top-six seeds are Nazareth, Downers Grove North, Kenwood, Lyons, St. Ignatius and Young. It's a loaded field that could set up some intriguing matchups as the playoffs progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If both Lyons and St. Ignatius each win their semifinal games, it'll set up a regional finals matchup between the two teams. The Wolfpack are battle-tested after making it to the Class 3A state championship last season. Senior guard Gabby Hinton is a stabilizing force, and junior forward Kaylee Clarke is averaging eight points and 10 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyons has dealt with injuries, most notably to senior forward Emma O'Brien, which is a big loss for the Lions because of O'Brien's ability to score in a multitude of ways while anchoring the defense. Without her, the Lions still have enough to advance in the playoffs with senior forward Gwen Smith and freshman guard Kennedy Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Nazareth beats Riverside-Brookfield on Tuesday, then it will have one of the toughest regional finals matchups if Young beats Reavis. Young has been a roller-coaster this season, but they were able to finish the CPS portion of its season emphatically with a 51-36 win over Lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young has a two-headed duo at guard with sophomores Harmony Cooper and Yanni Smith. Sophomore forward Jordyn Ellis is an athletic forward who can make a considerable impact with her length whenever she’s on the floor. Junior forward Neelah Leech is also an important connector on both ends of the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A potential Young-Nazareth matchup would be very intriguing. Nazareth is one of the best teams in the area, but has had moments of offensive stagnation. But the Roadrunners are an experienced group led by BYU commit Stella Sakalas, one of the area's best players. She is a dynamic talent who has demonstrated that she can be a force in the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Super 25, with record and last week’s ranking:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Nazareth (28-3) 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. 1 seed in Hinsdale Central sectional&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Tuesday's high will be 48 degrees, and temperatures are expected to drop toward the end of the week with highs in the 30s and 40s, with a possibility of rain Tuesday and Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mid-February average temperatures usually hover around the 30s with potential to dip to frigid temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A record could be set Monday if the temperature at O'Hare Airport surpasses 58 degrees, the warmest temperature recorded for Feb. 16, set more than a century ago in 1921. Temperatures the rest of the week are expected to be unseasonably warm, but the area probably won't break records later in the week.

It’s Michigan, man&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Arizona having lost two in a row — not to mention hotshot freshman Koa Peat to an unspecified injury — Michigan will be the no-doubt-about-it new No. 1-ranked team on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of us already thought the Wolverines (24-1) were the best team, just saying. They’ve won 10 straight. They trailed by 16 in the second half at Northwestern last week, yet still won by a dozen. They came back Saturday and blew out UCLA by 30. When this team — off to the best start in school history — puts the pedal down, it’s flippin’ scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and guess who plays at Purdue on Tuesday?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/college-sports/2026/02/15/illinois-keaton-wagler-david-mrkovic-kasparas-jakucionis-will-riley-terrance-shannon-illini-march-madness\"   &gt;Illini freshmen (better than last year?), NCAA potential (better than 2024?) shine through in rout of Indiana&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/college-sports/2026/02/10/college-basketball-illinois-michigan-arizona-duke-cameron-boozer-keaton-wagler\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Entering college basketball’s stretch run, here are 10 things to get you all caught up&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Purple pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northwestern, loser of five straight, is tied with Penn State at the bottom of the Big Ten at 2-13. Going by conference record, it’s the worst team 13th-year coach Chris Collins has had and the worst Wildcats team since the 2007-08 squad went 1-17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wildcats did beat Penn State in late January, giving them the tiebreaker just in case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So they’ve got that going for them, which is, you know, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sooner or later&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma is on a two-game winning streak. Other than that, coach Porter Moser’s experience this season has been like an out-of-control Sooner Schooner. Did you know that losing eight straight SEC games isn’t ideal? Now Moser, the former Loyola hero, knows it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But wait — it’s his fifth straight sub-.500 SEC season since leaving Rogers Park for the big-time. Things just aren’t working. His seat is hot. There are fans shouting for his dismissal. Any chance football can start half a year early? That might be the only thing that would save him. That, or an out-of-nowhere SEC tournament title run.

It seems I am a \"jerk attractor,\" and I don't know how to make it stop. The worst of these jerks can't take a hint that I'm not interested. One of them is a co-worker who sexually harasses me all day. Please help me so I stop attracting these losers. — &lt;i&gt;FRIENDLY IN MASSACHUSETTS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR FRIENDLY:&lt;/b&gt; While this is certainly not your fault in any way, many women in the hospitality industry wear a wedding ring to discourage the kind of unwelcome attention you have described. However, a co-worker doing this is a different story. There are workplace rules to protect women and men, and they should be listed in your employee handbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start documenting what this person has been doing and warn the other female employees. The next time it happens, inform him that the name for what he's doing is harassment, it's unwelcome and you will report it to your boss. If that doesn't discourage him, follow through, because it could cost him his job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; I have a longtime friend with whom I had a wonderful relationship. Over the last couple of years, he has made some bad life decisions. He is now without a job, without a girlfriend and in an apartment that's less than desirable. For a long time, I kept my opinions to myself. But, finally, I started offering advice with the hope he'd see that his decisions are causing him grief and hardship. I always do it with love, but he becomes very upset when I try to help him. Am I wrong for trying to guide a dear friend toward a better path? — &lt;i&gt;IN A DILEMMA IN NEW JERSEY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR DILEMMA:&lt;/b&gt; Your friend may not be ready to listen to someone telling him he has chosen the wrong path. Because the guidance you have so generously offered has fallen on deaf ears, recognize you are wasting your time and turn off your fountain of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My husband and I are seniors. We got married in 2020. When we were dating, things were fun and good. Now, however, I'm in a no-talk, no-response nightmare. After the first two years, he changed. He never starts conversations and never says \"thank you\" for anything. He simply doesn't talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I ask questions, he won't respond or acknowledge me in any way. If someone calls, he talks and talks with them. Does he hate me? I speak my mind and voice my disappointment. Should I still try to fix it or get out? — &lt;i&gt;STUCK IN SILENCE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR STUCK:&lt;/b&gt; You can't fix something that may not be your fault. However, before calling it quits, you can offer your husband the opportunity to get your marriage back on track with the help of a licensed marriage and family therapist. Schedule an appointment with one, and if your husband refuses to go with you, go alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

While we're in a grateful mood, let's also remember the contributions of his buddy, Ken Griffin: a bicycle bridge on the lakefront path and the addition of his name to the venerable Museum of Science and Industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these — to say the least — divisive political times, we can all agree it's good that everyone can now enjoy a fine work of art.

Rauner, for letting us all enjoy your tax write-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jim Bruton, Avondale&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bad Bunny rises above hate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad Bunny, the Puerto Rican-born musician, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, headlined the Super Bowl halftime show. Condemned by some, folks in our community saw it as a vindication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Puerto Ricans contribute significantly to society as poets, prophets, doctors, lawyers and engineers. Similarly, America is enriched by diverse communities, including Mexicans, Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Colombians, Venezuelans and Cubans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad Bunny has taken a cue from the prophet Marvin Gaye: \"War is not the answer, for only love can conquer hate.” Bad Bunny's emphasis on love and unity mirrors the significant societal changes we have seen historically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There comes a moment in the continuum of human history when the tides of opinion shift so dramatically that what was once widely accepted becomes universally condemned. This phenomenon, while gradual and often imperceptible in its nascent stages, culminates in a collective epiphany that compels societies to reassess their values, beliefs and actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this transformative process lies dissent. Dissenters, often marginalized and ridiculed in their time, play a crucial role in highlighting the flaws and injustices of prevailing systems. Their voices, though initially drowned out by the clamor of conformity, plant the seeds of doubt and introspection. Over time, these seeds grow into a groundswell of opposition that cannot be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History shows many paradigm shifts. Slavery, once widely accepted, faced strong opposition from abolitionists driven by moral conviction. Through persistent advocacy, they changed public opinion. Now, slavery is universally condemned, and past justifications are scorned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the suffrage movement, which sought to secure voting rights for women, faced substantial resistance. The notion that women were incapable of participating in democratic processes was deeply entrenched. However, the tireless efforts of suffragists gradually eroded these prejudices, leading to a global acknowledgment of women's rights. What was once a radical idea is now a fundamental principle of modern democracies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad Bunny’s performance resonates with timeless wisdom and profound truth: \"The only thing more powerful than hate is love.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ramon Ocasio III and Beatriz Santiago, members, Puerto Rican Bar Association of Illinois&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joe McCarthy lives rent-free in Trump’s head&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a tried and true son of Wisconsin, immensely proud of larger than life and positively impactful daughters and sons of Wisconsin who came before, such as famed conservationist &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://nelsonearthday.net/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Gaylord Nelson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am also painfully aware of the prominently nefarious son of Wisconsin, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://bioguide.congress.gov/search/bio/M000315\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Joseph McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;. For those who need a reminder, McCarthy — &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://onesearch.library.wwu.edu/discovery/fulldisplay/alma9985403820001453/01ALLIANCE_WWU:WWU\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“America’s most hated senator”&lt;/a&gt; — ruined careers and lives through baseless persecution of fellow Americans under his Red Scare of the 1950s. You may have heard of the definitive \"Have you no sense of decency?\" query by U.S. Army attorney Joseph Welch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCarthy also fomented a Lavender Scare — persecution of purported gays serving in the State Department, particularly irksome to me, as an openly gay international civil servant and senior presidential appointee in the Obama administration. And particularly ironic, since McCarthy’s closest adviser, Roy Cohn, was himself a torturously closeted gay man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohn went on to serve as mentor and lawyer to the Trump business in New York City, using deeply unscrupulous methods to ensure Trump’s emerging real estate empire avoided prosecution for things like discriminatory housing practices. Throughout Cohn’s career, his defining mantra was deny, deny, deny; attack, attack, attack; claim victory, whatever the outcome. The end always justifies the means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar? Trump was indeed a dutiful student of Cohn over those years. A bromance too distasteful to analyze in psycho-sexual detail. But a few facts do jump out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohn referred to Donald Trump as his best friend. Cohn told journalists Trump phoned him 15 to 20 times a day. According to Christine Seymour, Cohn’s longtime switchboard operator, Trump was the last person to speak to Cohn on the phone before he died ignominiously in 1986.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump reportedly asked, \"Where's my Roy Cohn?’ in frustration when Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation in 2018 (perhaps Stephen Miller is Roy Cohn reincarnated).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Trump’s remaining mental faculties fade, it is clear that McCarthy, via Cohn, continues to live rent-free in the increasingly spacious real estate of Trump’s head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Todd Larson, Blanchardville, Wisconsin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

After helping write &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus?GAID=18&amp;amp;DocNum=2795&amp;amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;amp;LegId=0&amp;amp;SessionID=114\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;House Bill 2795&lt;/a&gt;, an ethics bill aimed at forcing conflict-of-interest disclosures for legislators in the Illinois General Assembly, I've learned democracy is far more delicate. It's a contact sport. It requires active participation, clear rules and a referee with the authority to blow the whistle. Unfortunately, our legislators have let the guardrails rust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hit the flux capacitor, Marty, and let's go back in time: The &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ILCS/details?MajorTopic=GOVERNMENT&amp;amp;Chapter=GENERAL%20PROVISIONS&amp;amp;ActName=Illinois%20Governmental%20Ethics%20Act.&amp;amp;ActID=129&amp;amp;ChapterID=2&amp;amp;SeqStart=&amp;amp;&amp;amp;ChapAct=FullText\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Illinois Governmental Ethics Act&lt;/a&gt; was passed in 1967, back when a first-class stamp cost 5 cents and the Sears Tower didn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-480000\" name=\"module-480000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Commentary bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commentary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, we've only seen two significant updates. One was the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://law.justia.com/codes/illinois/chapter-5/act-5-ilcs-430/article-25/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;creation&lt;/a&gt; of the office of the legislative inspector general. This office is designed to police the legislative branch, yet it has failed to do so. Upon her resignation, former Legislative Inspector General Carol Pope famously called the office a \"&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nprillinois.org/statehouse/2021-07-14/paper-tiger-illinois-legislative-watchdog-resigns-citing-lack-of-ethics-reform\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;paper tiger&lt;/a&gt;.\" She was right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois legislative inspector general lacks the power to launch independent investigations or even receive disclosures directly. Furthermore, the Illinois Governmental Ethics Act fails to define a \"conflict of interest,\" merely stating a legislator \"should consider the possibility\" of eliminating one. In Springfield, a suggestion is effectively a green light. No bite equals a paper tiger. Perhaps the reason we have had so many corruption convictions is because we lack the oversight needed to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-8c0000\" name=\"image-8c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d95f0f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6950x3901+0+368/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe1%2F7a%2F0039b38bd9ca06df088d72e5bfa0%2Fmadigan-010423-12.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/50e91de/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6950x3901+0+368/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe1%2F7a%2F0039b38bd9ca06df088d72e5bfa0%2Fmadigan-010423-12.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c57541b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6950x3901+0+368/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe1%2F7a%2F0039b38bd9ca06df088d72e5bfa0%2Fmadigan-010423-12.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Illinois’ former House Speaker Michael Madigan walks out of a courthouse.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c57541b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6950x3901+0+368/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe1%2F7a%2F0039b38bd9ca06df088d72e5bfa0%2Fmadigan-010423-12.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f557502/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6950x3901+0+368/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe1%2F7a%2F0039b38bd9ca06df088d72e5bfa0%2Fmadigan-010423-12.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c57541b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6950x3901+0+368/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe1%2F7a%2F0039b38bd9ca06df088d72e5bfa0%2Fmadigan-010423-12.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan is in a federal prison camp for bribery conspiracy, wire fraud and other crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashlee Rezin/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Illinois remains stagnant, other states have recognized \"trust me\" is not a policy. At least 40 states have laws limiting what a legislator can vote on when a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/ethics/voting-recusal-provisions\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;conflict arises&lt;/a&gt;. Some force recusal; others allow the inspectors general or other ethics officials to issue formal advisory opinions. This seems like common sense to anyone reading. Apparently, it's not so common in our state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois, meanwhile, asks for a three-page statement of economic interest that reveals next to nothing. This is a document the legislative inspector general cannot even legally look into. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find your representatives' disclosures on the Illinois secretary of state's &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apps.ilsos.gov/economicinterest/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;website&lt;/a&gt; and see for yourself. Read the inspector general’s quarterly reports, and you'll find \"miscellaneous\" claims while voters remain in the dark. This begs the question: Where do these disclosures go, and why isn't the inspector general authorized to independently examine them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pass a law with teeth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tired of watching from the sidelines, I put on my helmet and got on the field. I've spent the last several years as a private citizen and business owner meeting with the House, Senate and inspector general to resolve this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been a privilege to work with legislators who admitted they needed \"air support.\" Together, we drafted what I believe is the most comprehensive overhaul of the Illinois Governmental Ethics Act in decades: House Bill 2795.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our team has worked tirelessly to garner 15 bipartisan co-sponsors. This bill finally defines a conflict of interest and mandates disclosure. It gives the inspector general the authority to review those disclosures and issue public advisory opinions. It allows our state to finally police itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the legislative branch has failed to even assign the bill to the Ethics Committee this session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democracy is not a butterfly-catching contest. It's a struggle for the integrity of our home. Proper governance requires an audit, not an \"option to consider.\" If we continue to let elected officials act at their sole discretion, the system fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is time for House Speaker Chris Welch to reassign House Bill 2795 to the Ethics Committee, push for a subject matter hearing&amp;nbsp;and get it to the floor for a vote. My neighbors have seen enough paper tigers. It's time to give the watchdog a whistle and get in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael Sparrow is a Chicago-based advocate for government transparency and the primary catalyst behind Team FRWRD, a small Chicago-based grassroots movement of volunteers advocating for government reform and an end to systemic corruption in Illinois and the federal government.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-710000\" name=\"module-710000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

They make $258,000 a year, hold extraordinary power, and almost never get fired or even disciplined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But fewer and fewer attorneys are seeking the post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the second straight judicial primary election, less than half of the seats up for grabs March 17 drew more than one candidate, continuing a decadeslong slide in competition. Observers have cited factors including the cost of campaigning, increased public scrutiny on judicial elections, and a Democratic Party that dominates local politics and discourages competition against its chosen candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result? Candidates in 16 of the 28 circuit court races are virtually assured to breeze onto the bench, where they could decide who goes to prison, holds a driver’s license, or keeps their kids. Some candidates on a glide path have liabilities that might hurt them in a contested race, including one with an arrest record, one with a history of failing to pay income taxes, and one who only recently moved to Cook County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four vacancies in the 13th subcircuit — which covers the far Northwest suburbs — are uncontested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The candidate for one of those seats is Brittany Michelle Pedersen, who has been charged with driving under the influence three times, though one case was dismissed and two were reduced to reckless driving. Pedersen ran unsuccessfully for judge in Kane County in 2020 and 2022, receiving negative ratings from the Illinois State Bar Association, before moving in with her mother in Cook County and running again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told Injustice Watch, “I believe that people deserve second chances, and third chances, and maybe sometimes a fourth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In past years, candidates who won a Democratic primary in the northwest suburbs might have faced a Republican challenger in the November general election. But this year, not a single Republican filed to run for judge in Cook County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves a lot of power in the hands of the Cook County Democratic Party. The party itself only endorses candidates in countywide races — five circuit judge hopefuls this cycle — but its leaders wield influence in the more numerous races in the subcircuits, geographic districts where voters pick judges to serve the whole county. Historically, party officials have worked to eliminate competition for their favored candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Quality over quantity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook County Democratic Party Chair Toni Preckwinkle said in an interview that she wants a diverse, qualified group of candidates, not simply a crowded field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-6a0000\" name=\"image-6a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a8c712a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2Fb2%2Fd84f173a69948ee510c4f5bf3fdb%2Fmerlin-81110984.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1e133f6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2Fb2%2Fd84f173a69948ee510c4f5bf3fdb%2Fmerlin-81110984.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64a32e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2Fb2%2Fd84f173a69948ee510c4f5bf3fdb%2Fmerlin-81110984.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Cook County President Toni Preckwinkle\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64a32e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2Fb2%2Fd84f173a69948ee510c4f5bf3fdb%2Fmerlin-81110984.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0cabaec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2Fb2%2Fd84f173a69948ee510c4f5bf3fdb%2Fmerlin-81110984.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64a32e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2245+0+211/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2Fb2%2Fd84f173a69948ee510c4f5bf3fdb%2Fmerlin-81110984.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun-Times file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My concern is really quality, not quantity.

Primaries are crucial to determining the direction of the local court system because the absence of Republican candidates means Democrats who emerge from the primary are virtually assured to win the general election in November.

One of those has been a lively neighborhood campaign between appointed Judge Ginger Odom, Cook County Assistant Public Defender Ashley Greer Shambley and Tiffany N. Brooks, who has held numerous jobs in city and county government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Injustice Watch reporters also found many candidates with thick family ties to the court. Stephanie S. Kelly, who is running unopposed in the 5th subcircuit on Chicago’s South Side, is married to Judge David L. Kelly. In the northwest suburban 13th subcircuit, William F. Kelley is set to become the third Kelley to serve as a Cook County judge, following in the footsteps of brothers Martin, who died in 2024, and Thomas, who retired last year. Dan Balanoff, who is running in the 8th subcircuit that runs from the North Side to the South Side west of the Loop, is the son and grandson of former Cook County judges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the most noticeable thing about the field is its small size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the second straight cycle, the percentage of circuit court races that drew only one candidate was about 57%, higher than any year going back to at least 2006, an Injustice Watch analysis of state elections data found. Between 2006 and 2014, an average of 3.2 candidates ran for every circuit court seat. The past two election cycles, an average of 1.6 candidates have turned out for each race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is certainly a problem for our democracy that voters do not have a choice between candidates in many elections,” said E.J. Fagan, an associate professor of political science at the University of Illinois Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No ironclad explanation exists, but candidates, consultants and others experienced with local elections have cited a host of factors that might be driving down competition in judicial races — a trend &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.injusticewatch.org/judges/judicial-elections/2024-primary/2024/2024-primary-cook-county-judicial-candidates-uncompetitive/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Injustice Watch also detailed during the last primary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Those include the expense that can come with campaigning and increased public focus on the races, as well as the withering of the Cook County Republican Party. And while a judge’s salary might be a pay boost for a government lawyer — a mainstay of judicial elections — plenty of private lawyers would be volunteering for a pay cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘Road to the Robe’ training&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Democrats’ endorsement process has changed significantly with the decline of the patronage system and exit of white, Irish kingmakers who anointed loyal candidates. Preckwinkle said the party now tries to bring out a robust field of good attorneys from varying backgrounds through its free “Road to the Robe” training sessions with candidates and preliminary endorsement process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether party leaders prefer limited competition to clear the way for their chosen candidates, she said, “If we were trying to discourage competition, we wouldn't have the ‘Road to the Robe.’ We wouldn't be out there providing people with information about what goes on in the process, both elections and in slating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preckwinkle said some candidates might stay out of the races because of the party’s recent emphasis on picking those with solid bar ratings. Those positive ratings are elusive for some hopefuls, as local bar associations can be tough on inexperienced candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We've had progressively more success as we have both insisted on good bar ratings and become more inclusive. I think those things have gone in tandem and they’ve contributed to the party’s success in electing our candidates,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spotlight on judicial elections is also hotter now. Activists over the last decade have waged successful campaigns to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.injusticewatch.org/judges/judicial-elections/2018-retention/2018/embattled-cook-county-judge-coghlan-loses-party-support-in-bid-to-keep-his-seat/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;push judges off the bench&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and others &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.injusticewatch.org/judges/judicial-elections/2024-retention/2024/cook-county-final-retention-results-omalley/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;lost amid scandals&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, publications started to highlight the races, including the Injustice Watch election guide and the Girl, I Guess Progressive Voter guide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That focus on the quality of candidates might have the effect of scaring some people away from running, said Elizabeth Monkus, who oversees the judicial candidate evaluation process for the Chicago Council of Lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As the public becomes more aware of the importance of judicial elections, it unfortunately makes people more reluctant to put the effort into it,” she said. “It’s seen as more political and professional than it used to be in terms of what you have to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Injustice Watch staff contributed reporting.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The two leagues couldn’t have been more different. The NBA was the established league with TV contracts, top players and a style of play that was considered slow, predictable and highly regulated. And despite much of the ABA not being televised nationally, the league attained legendary status thanks to word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new four-part docuseries, “Soul Power: The Legend of the American Basketball Association,” executive produced by Chicago rapper Common and ABA players Julius “Dr. J” Erving and George Karl, is a look back at the league’s history and forward to what the NBA has become: one of the most popular sports in the world. Also narrated by Common, “Soul Power” celebrates the ABA, its players and contributions to the game of basketball, which at the time wasn’t even the number two sport in America. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ABA greats of the past serve as some of the last living legends in American sports; the roots of what they accomplished still reach out to connect us today,” Common says in the docuseries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-b20000\" name=\"image-b20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c238330/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2806+0+264/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F68%2F44%2F2ebcc5de41a2bfbabeef3f141f57%2F2260982617.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cfc218f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2806+0+264/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F68%2F44%2F2ebcc5de41a2bfbabeef3f141f57%2F2260982617.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d031c59/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2806+0+264/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F68%2F44%2F2ebcc5de41a2bfbabeef3f141f57%2F2260982617.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"&amp;quot;Soul Power: The Legend Of The American Basketball Association&amp;quot; World Premiere\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d031c59/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2806+0+264/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F68%2F44%2F2ebcc5de41a2bfbabeef3f141f57%2F2260982617.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/92c7b98/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2806+0+264/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F68%2F44%2F2ebcc5de41a2bfbabeef3f141f57%2F2260982617.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d031c59/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5000x2806+0+264/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F68%2F44%2F2ebcc5de41a2bfbabeef3f141f57%2F2260982617.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Karl (from left), Julius Erving, Artis Gilmore and Brian Taylor attend the “Soul Power: The Legend Of The American Basketball Association” world premiere at Regal Cinemas Union Square on Feb. 10 in New York City.

One of the standout talents of this era was Artis Gilmore, who was drafted by both the Kentucky Colonels of the ABA and the Chicago Bulls of the NBA in 1971. The battle for his services was fierce from the start. The ABA won round one, as the star center from Jacksonville University signed with Kentucky. Round two came five years later during the 1976 merger negotiations, and the Bulls remained insistent that Gilmore was rightfully theirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Kentucky Colonels should have made it into the NBA ... but the Chicago Bulls' owner [Arthur Wirtz] had to have Artis Gilmore. He said, ‘That’s my one stipulation. I gotta have Artis.’ And the only way for him to get Artis was to keep Kentucky out of the NBA,” director Kenan Kamwana Holley said at the premiere of “Soul Power” Feb. 10 in New York. Whether Chicago brass prevented Kentucky from coming to the NBA or not, one thing they knew for sure was that Gilmore would provide the centerpiece the Bulls needed. This was the guy who led Kentucky to the 1975 ABA Championship, was Finals MVP and averaged over 20 points and 20 rebounds per game — a superstar by any measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where many consider “Dr. J” as one of the greatest players to play in the ABA/NBA, “The Doctor” himself was quick to point out there was already a superstar worthy of that title. Erving said at the premiere: “When I came in as a rookie, I wasn't the best player in the league. It was the guy who won Rookie of the Year and MVP, Artis Gilmore.” Gilmore was described as being an unstoppable train whenever he attacked the basket, hence the moniker “A-Train.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-bb0000\" name=\"image-bb0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49742df/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2060x1156+0+761/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2F7b%2Ffa898d90455b8dfbdbea59849a60%2F03670-13-2802.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b20ce6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2060x1156+0+761/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2F7b%2Ffa898d90455b8dfbdbea59849a60%2F03670-13-2802.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0919965/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2060x1156+0+761/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2F7b%2Ffa898d90455b8dfbdbea59849a60%2F03670-13-2802.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"03670-13.2802.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0919965/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2060x1156+0+761/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2F7b%2Ffa898d90455b8dfbdbea59849a60%2F03670-13-2802.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c4526a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2060x1156+0+761/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2F7b%2Ffa898d90455b8dfbdbea59849a60%2F03670-13-2802.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0919965/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2060x1156+0+761/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2F7b%2Ffa898d90455b8dfbdbea59849a60%2F03670-13-2802.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artis Gilmore was described as being an unstoppable train whenever he attacked the basket, hence the moniker “A-Train.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun-Times file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Princeton standout and two-time ABA champion Brian Taylor added, “He was like a man amongst boys really, with his size, 7'2 frame and strength. That's back in the game where the low post was the game.” Gilmore was the first pick of the NBA’s ABA supplemental draft for a reason, and his arrival to Chicago in 1976 added an important cornerstone to an already legendary foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gilmore steps into the spotlight in episodes three and four of “Soul Power” with several highlight reels. In fact, the very first dunk in the ABA Dunk Contest was made by the A-Train himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think initially I was the one that was the father of the blocked shots. That’s when they started originally bringing [blocks] onto the stat sheet,” Gilmore told the Sun-Times at the premiere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; From blocked shots, three-pointers, run-and-gun play and the dunk contest, the ABA game had a different vibe that Dr. J attributes to a “playground” style of play. “I grew up playing on playgrounds… once I got outta college I went over to Harlem, started playing in the Rucker League, there was no conformity now. It was just, they took the chains off, so let's go!”  &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1976 to 1982 Gilmore was the bridge between the old-school Bulls and the Michael Jordan era. He returned to the Bulls in 1987 for a brief stint to help out rookies Scottie Pippen and Horace Grant, bringing both his pedigree and a lesson in toughness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite never winning an NBA title, the Hall of Famer’s impact on the league cannot be measured by stats alone. He led the Bulls to two playoff runs where they lost both times to the eventual champions. In a testament to Gilmore’s influence, Erving, a two-time ABA and one-time NBA Champion, continued to praise Gilmore: “I wanted to be as good as Artis or better than him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-fa0000\" name=\"image-fa0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9bcce7c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2704x1518+0+741/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0b%2F15%2F7b0ad1bc4b6882615f46e58a74d9%2Fmike-mitchell.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/511bce8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2704x1518+0+741/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0b%2F15%2F7b0ad1bc4b6882615f46e58a74d9%2Fmike-mitchell.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fa3c69b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2704x1518+0+741/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0b%2F15%2F7b0ad1bc4b6882615f46e58a74d9%2Fmike-mitchell.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mike Mitchell\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fa3c69b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2704x1518+0+741/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0b%2F15%2F7b0ad1bc4b6882615f46e58a74d9%2Fmike-mitchell.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a917621/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2704x1518+0+741/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0b%2F15%2F7b0ad1bc4b6882615f46e58a74d9%2Fmike-mitchell.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fa3c69b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2704x1518+0+741/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0b%2F15%2F7b0ad1bc4b6882615f46e58a74d9%2Fmike-mitchell.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artis Gilmore (left) and Mike Mitchell go up for a rebound during a game in this undated file photo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun-Times file photo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; It isn’t until the final episode when viewers learn why the ABA and its soul power resonate so deeply with Common — beyond even his love for the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A love that celebrates a style, spirit and soul that lives on. “The NBA may think they defeated the ABA … but to defeat them, they had to become them,” Holley said. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All four episodes of “Soul Power: The Legend of the American Basketball Association” is currently airing on Prime Video.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Chicago first brought the issues to light last week in an &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/judy-chicago-google-2741752\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; on Artnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disclosures come as renovation work shifts to the interior of the former James R. Thompson Center; the exterior construction crane was taken down Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The troubles described by the artists (along with the images they supplied for this column) are the public's first look behind the glass walls of the $300 million conversion project, beyond the news releases and architectural renderings released by Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There are a lot of people in Chicago who feel very attached to that building,\" Chicago said. \"You know, I think if Google is going to do a building in a city like Chicago with its architectural history, they should be respectful of that history.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google spokesperson Ryan Lamont said the company sought to collaborate with Chicago on an interior art installation but couldn't agree on the project's specifications and timeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lamont wouldn't address the specifics of what Chicago and Woodman said but trumpeted Google's art curation program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artists met with Google's Chicago team, which includes architects at Jahn, the successor firm of Murphy/Jahn, the building's original designers who are handling the renovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago said the first problems arose when Google failed to provide construction drawings needed to help the couple figure out sizing and dimensions of their proposed work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Getting the renovation plans and accurate architectural drawings was a nightmare,\" Chicago said. \"Donald had to do most of that himself from his photographs that he took when we were there.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artists said another point of difficulty was Google's desire to lay the new terrazzo title over the existing one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach would require a thinner mix materials, but Google nixed letting Chicago and Woodman work directly with the terrazzo company to work out fabrication and other details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"

rosette replacing the one currently there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Chicago and Woodman said one project member complained Chicago's colors were too bright — an odd take given bright tones have been a hallmark of Chicago's work for more than six decades. The floor's design is based on the 1973 acrylic-on-canvas work \"Through the Flower,\" one of the artist's best-known paintings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the color intensity of the finished product might have looked different once it's taken through the detailed dance between artists and fabricators that involves things like material selection, and coatings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you see on a monitor or printout isn't always what you get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's much [like] a construction project [than buying] a painting and putting it on the wall, or to have a mural in a conference room \" Woodman said. \"This is a very unique project. I don't think Google has done this kind of thing very often.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since Google &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/architecture-design/2025/08/22/google-thompson-center-chicago-headquarters-construction-windows\"   &gt;released renderings&lt;/a&gt; of the renovation in 2024, there's been more than a little concern the building's unforgettable atrium, while not ripped down, would wind up blanded-out and ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google didn't say if the job would now pass on to another artist. But here was a chance to make a bold move to make sure the new work retained color and life — albeit in a different form — to a space that will still function as kind of a town square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the atrium floor and elevators winds up being a blown opportunity or not depends on who or what Google tees up next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago told me the existing floor could be moved outside and made a part of the building's new outdoor plaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think leaving the floor in place and restoring it would be a good idea at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Chicago and Woodman: \"I started [as an artist] when I was a little girl and ... used to go downtown to the Art Institute of Chicago, where I started taking art lessons,\" said Chicago, 86, who lives in New Mexico. \"And so to come back to Chicago, at the end of my career would have been, like, completing a circle. And a wonderful kind of ending to what started in Chicago.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/architecture-design/2025/08/22/google-thompson-center-chicago-headquarters-construction-windows\"   &gt;Google makes progress on Chicago headquarters with windows update&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Recent addition &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.82kimbap.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;82 Kimbap&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was drawing buzz for its Korean rice rolls packed with pickled radish, egg and proteins like beef bulgogi, creamy tuna salad and braised tofu. (The last was especially good dabbed in perilla vinaigrette).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next couple of hours unfolded with the rise and fall of chatter about workplace drama, laughter and cries of “Oh, I know this!” to a soundtrack of throwbacks like “Toxic” by Britney Spears. It was a heartening, if subdued, depiction of the kind of happy hour that once prevailed in the office-dense Loop and West Loop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this happy hour wasn't in a pub. It took place in a Downtown food hall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such momentum suggests there’s hope after all for the food hall, which roared on the scene over a decade ago as the millennial younger sibling of the chain-heavy, suburban food court. After a heydey, COVID-19 arrived, subduing office occupancy and killing several food hall concepts — including, on Jan. 23, Fulton Market’s once-thriving &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2026/01/14/time-out-market-chicago-to-shut-its-doors-this-month-in-fulton-market\"   &gt;Time Out Market.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-9c0000\" name=\"image-9c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4fcd6b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Ff9%2Fc8c4ef534f898874a1319be1bddc%2Ftimeoutmarket-260115-02.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e505f03/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Ff9%2Fc8c4ef534f898874a1319be1bddc%2Ftimeoutmarket-260115-02.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c953df4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Ff9%2Fc8c4ef534f898874a1319be1bddc%2Ftimeoutmarket-260115-02.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Time Out Market at 916 W Fulton Market in West Loop, Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c953df4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Ff9%2Fc8c4ef534f898874a1319be1bddc%2Ftimeoutmarket-260115-02.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ef22d61/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Ff9%2Fc8c4ef534f898874a1319be1bddc%2Ftimeoutmarket-260115-02.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c953df4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Ff9%2Fc8c4ef534f898874a1319be1bddc%2Ftimeoutmarket-260115-02.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fulton Market’s once-thriving Time Out Market closed on Jan. 23. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some saw Time Out’s closure as a warning sign. But not so fast, say those steering the city’s surviving food halls. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the headwinds of hybrid work and the prevailingly less-than-cool image of the Loop, a few stronger currents still favor the concept. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/work/2025/09/26/more-office-workers-revive-loop-but-office-vacancy-rate-still-high\"   &gt;Office tenancy&lt;/a&gt; is creeping back up, and coworkers want compelling lunch options and perhaps some wallet-friendly social connections before heading home. Such spaces also remain incubators for promising concepts and are getting more savvy about marketing themselves to tourists, who appreciate local options close to the sights without the hassle of booking tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Success may look a little different now, and it’s up to the operators to lean in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we started Revival, it was a very different feeling of what a food hall was and what we wanted to do and what people who subsequently started food halls gravitated to,” said Bruce Finkelman, managing partner at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.16oncenterchicago.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;16” On Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which opened Revival Food Hall in 2016 (now Sterling) and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.fromhereonchicago.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;From Here On Food Hall &amp;amp; Market &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in the Old Post Office Building in 2022. “We wanted to build a neighborhood place, a third place, for downtown or in a downtown building. Now you start looking at the purpose more as being an amenity to a building, and almost like a reason for people to come back to work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mid-2010s food halls were ascendant, cropping up in cities nationwide as multifaceted marketplaces featuring local and chef-driven food vendors and artisans. Between 2010 and 2017, the number of food halls in the U.S. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/business/food-hall-development.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;increased by roughly 700%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, reaching 220 by 2019, according to brokerage Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield. As of 2023, that number hit &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.costar.com/article/1172878173/as-they-mature-food-halls-go-to-college-and-move-out-to-suburbs\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;360&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, marketplaces like Revival, Aster Hall, Block 37, Time Out Market, Wells Street Market, Fulton Galley and Politan Row sprang up en masse amid soaring office structures and tourist hotspots Downtown and in the trendy, mixed-use West Loop. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notoriously hanging their hat on offering a variety of interesting food options, food halls like Revival regularly featured cooking and cocktail classes, bands and DJ sets, often packing the house for a few hours after work. Finkelman recalled the feeling of being “like the kitchen at a dinner party; this was &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; place,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-fa0000\" name=\"image-fa0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e2b9ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F28%2F0d%2F2138ea074e4b89dc5fff6aead7da%2Fgrocers-100525-48.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/271e832/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F28%2F0d%2F2138ea074e4b89dc5fff6aead7da%2Fgrocers-100525-48.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8327d8d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F28%2F0d%2F2138ea074e4b89dc5fff6aead7da%2Fgrocers-100525-48.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Customers shop at 88 Marketplace in Chinatown, Thursday, Oct. 2, 2025. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8327d8d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F28%2F0d%2F2138ea074e4b89dc5fff6aead7da%2Fgrocers-100525-48.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/481a243/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F28%2F0d%2F2138ea074e4b89dc5fff6aead7da%2Fgrocers-100525-48.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8327d8d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F28%2F0d%2F2138ea074e4b89dc5fff6aead7da%2Fgrocers-100525-48.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;88 Marketplace has become a chef’s magnet for affordable sushi, noodles and Chinese groceries since it opened in 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on the hype, food halls arrived in less foot traffic-heavy neighborhoods, albeit with mixed success. On the edge of Chinatown, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://88marketplace.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;88 Marketplace&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has become a chef’s magnet for affordable sushi, noodles and Chinese groceries since it opened in 2021. But some other concepts haven’t panned out. One Eleven debuted in Pullman in 2019 as an incubator for Black restaurateurs; by the fall of 2021 Dominique Leach’s barbecue spot, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.lexingtonbetty.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Lexington Betty Smokehouse&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, took over. The vegan XMarket, which opened in 2023, lasted just one year in Uptown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘What are you guys doing to bring customers in?’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 killed some food hall projects, including Politan Row and Wells Street Market. In a statement, Time Out Market CEO Michael Marlay attributed its closure last month to the pandemic and inconsistent foot traffic due to remote work, though vendors have since pointed to loss of revenue due to neglect and lack of investment, according to reporting by &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.eater.com/restaurant-news/166957/time-out-market-chicago-closing-boston\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Eater&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Honestly, I wasn’t excited with the sales, and I was one of the busiest vendors there, which they told me a few times,” said Jessica Perjes, co-owner of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.tacotlan.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Tacotlán&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Hermosa. The family-owned birria joint had a stall at Time Out Market from late October until a week before it closed. “I was like, what are you guys doing to bring customers in?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the cultural caché seems to have shifted toward highly specialized supermarkets focused on specific cuisines. When I polled my social media for favorite food halls, most cited 88 Marketplace; Asian grocer and food court &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://gangnammarketusa.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Gangnam Market&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; and Korean-leaning supermarket chain &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.hmart.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;H Mart&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (“Does H Mart even count?” two rather tellingly asked.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, a handful of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/chicagofood/comments/1jhcudr/current_chicago_food_hall_options/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Chicago Food subredditors &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;declared the trend mostly over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not the most interesting scene honestly,” one wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m both wildly underwhelmed and wildly overcharged whenever I do go to one,” wrote another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-7f0000\" name=\"image-7f0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2e0557/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb6%2F1a%2Feccb47274e1b9af8138ec796f393%2Ftimeoutmarket-260115-04.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3cbf1e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb6%2F1a%2Feccb47274e1b9af8138ec796f393%2Ftimeoutmarket-260115-04.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2c6d271/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb6%2F1a%2Feccb47274e1b9af8138ec796f393%2Ftimeoutmarket-260115-04.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Time Out Market at 916 W Fulton Market in West Loop, Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2c6d271/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb6%2F1a%2Feccb47274e1b9af8138ec796f393%2Ftimeoutmarket-260115-04.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/015df83/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb6%2F1a%2Feccb47274e1b9af8138ec796f393%2Ftimeoutmarket-260115-04.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2c6d271/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb6%2F1a%2Feccb47274e1b9af8138ec796f393%2Ftimeoutmarket-260115-04.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being open late and on weekends in a touristy entertainment district also provided Time Out Market with unique potential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In such a cutthroat space, food halls can’t count on individual vendor buzz alone, even if said vendor has more than 50,000 &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@tacotlantacos?lang=en\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;TikTok&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; followers, like Tacotlán. Perjes recalled asking management to be kept in the loop on everything happening at Time Out Market, “because if I know it, I’m able to tell my customers and drive more traffic on my social media,” she said. “I didn’t see that from them. They’d put events on a big old board, but I wasn’t there often enough to see it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being open late and on weekends in a touristy entertainment district also provided the location with unique potential. The market’s huge television broke during a considerable part of the NFL season, when fans would’ve come to watch the Bears’ surprisingly successful run. When Perjes asked about it, she was told fixing it was too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It took so long for them to try to figure it out,” she said. “They ended up getting a smaller TV, and brought it downstairs. It helped; we started seeing a lot more traction in the food hall. The whole thing was like, what is going on? Do you guys even care?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘People are really craving that third space’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Downtown food halls, things are — kind of — looking up. Weekly office occupancy hit a post-pandemic record of 55.8% last fall across several major U.S. cities, and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/work/2025/09/26/more-office-workers-revive-loop-but-office-vacancy-rate-still-high\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;averaged 58.7% in Chicago in September 2025&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is according to the security systems company Kastle, which has tracked office activity by counting badge swipes since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foot traffic and transactions at the food hall in the Old Post Office have increased between 18 and 20% year over year since its 2022 debut, per Finkelman. Over the past year, the hall is seeing bigger spikes in repeat customers three to four times per week as more companies call employees back to the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterling has filled all but one vendor stall since parent company STHRN Hospitality assumed ownership from 16” On Center 18 months ago. (They spent the first six months “battling misinformation that the hall had permanently closed,” STHRN cofounder Kelly Campbell told me.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, Sterling upped its advertising spend and partnered with Chicago tourism to get on more tourists’ radar. Weekly sales are up about 33% compared to a year ago, and visitor traffic has increased. In the fourth quarter of 2025, Sterling averaged 1,712 customers per operating day, 297 more each day compared with the same period in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-db0000\" name=\"image-db0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4676ab5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa8%2Fb5%2F9a4ef7f64a00a4c65b3ebcbcff17%2Ffoodhallsurvival-260213-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dbbe83e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa8%2Fb5%2F9a4ef7f64a00a4c65b3ebcbcff17%2Ffoodhallsurvival-260213-10.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/27be5aa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa8%2Fb5%2F9a4ef7f64a00a4c65b3ebcbcff17%2Ffoodhallsurvival-260213-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"82 Kimbap and Saffron Street at Sterling Food Hall in the Loop are seen in this photo, Wednesday, Feb. 11, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/27be5aa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa8%2Fb5%2F9a4ef7f64a00a4c65b3ebcbcff17%2Ffoodhallsurvival-260213-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/61359d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa8%2Fb5%2F9a4ef7f64a00a4c65b3ebcbcff17%2Ffoodhallsurvival-260213-10.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/27be5aa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa8%2Fb5%2F9a4ef7f64a00a4c65b3ebcbcff17%2Ffoodhallsurvival-260213-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sterling has filled all but one vendor stall since parent company STHRN Hospitality assumed ownership from 16” On Center 18 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutaz Abdullah, owner of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://seedosbakery.net/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Seedo’s Levantine Bakery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at Sterling, is happy to average 150 transactions most weekdays at lunch. He has since opened a second location at Madison and Wells, in a former outpost of the counter-service Mediterranean restaurant &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.mezzagrillchicago.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Mezza Mediterranean Grill&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which the self-described Loop lifer Abdullah opened with his partners in 2003. In 2008 they also opened &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.habanerobajagrill.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Habanero Baja Grill&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have not reached the levels I experienced opening and running those concepts, especially on Mondays and Fridays when it’s about half of what it used to be,” Abdullah said. “I could argue we’re probably 80% there on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abdullah still believes in the potential of the food hall. He hopes &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/lori-lightfoot-lasalle-street-apartment-projects/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;efforts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the early 2020s to revitalize Downtown with more city-subsidized residences will help shore up the slow rebound of office occupancy. For now, he thinks there’s enough of a captive audience to try and refill the third place void.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think people are really craving that third space that’s not just a restaurant, bakery or coffee shop,” Abdullah said. “Sterling has the space, there’s a bar, there’s a bunch of great, interesting vendors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STHRN cofounder George Banks told me that in addition to in-building, off-premise catering, Sterling sees the most growth potential in the “in-between hours” — as in an afternoon bite or happy hour. (The Flamingo Bar and several vendors offer discounts daily starting at 4 p.m.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, according to a recent dining trends &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.opentable.com/c/top-restaurants/dining-trends/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by OpenTable, 35% of Americans planned to prioritize happy hour drinks and snacks when dining out in the historically quiet (and dryish) January. On that note, dining at 4 p.m. was up 13% compared to the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-410000\" name=\"image-410000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a1687d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7f%2Fae%2F5e823be34002a4ab3e711302cc61%2Ffoodhallsurvival-260213-9.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/001e5fd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7f%2Fae%2F5e823be34002a4ab3e711302cc61%2Ffoodhallsurvival-260213-9.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4463a7a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7f%2Fae%2F5e823be34002a4ab3e711302cc61%2Ffoodhallsurvival-260213-9.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"People eat at Sterling Food Hall in the Loop, Wednesday, Feb. 11, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4463a7a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7f%2Fae%2F5e823be34002a4ab3e711302cc61%2Ffoodhallsurvival-260213-9.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d800c7c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7f%2Fae%2F5e823be34002a4ab3e711302cc61%2Ffoodhallsurvival-260213-9.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4463a7a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7f%2Fae%2F5e823be34002a4ab3e711302cc61%2Ffoodhallsurvival-260213-9.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think people are really craving that third space that’s not just a restaurant, bakery or coffee shop,” Mutaz Abdullah, owner of Seedo’s Levantine Bakery, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food halls remain uniquely positioned to appeal to a food-minded public, allowing them to restaurant shop. They also offer a lower-risk entry point for restaurateurs to dip a few toes into a concept to see if it has legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall, 175 people turned up for the first of Sterling’s discovery-focused Showcase series, paying $10 in advance ($15 at the door) to sample bites from any three vendors. About 225 came to the second. Sterling plans to bring it back in the spring and to feature more programming like last year’s wine tasting and DJ set collaboration with the sommelier and DJ duo &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.samplesandsamples.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Samples &amp;amp; Samples&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are definitely younger people not rushing out who want a drink at the end of the day,” Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question of how many remains elusive in a culture that still embraces some remote work such that it can be a bargaining chip for coveted prospective employees. When folks &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; come into the office, they’re eager for human interaction. And many still want a drink and a hang once 5 p.m. finally arrives.&lt;/p&gt;",

They make $258,000 a year, hold extraordinary power, and almost never get fired or even disciplined.&amp;nbsp;But decreasingly fewer attorneys are seeking the post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contributing factors&lt;/b&gt;: Observers have cited factors including the cost of campaigning, increased public scrutiny on judicial elections, and a Democratic Party that dominates local politics and discourages competition against its chosen candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The result&lt;/b&gt;​​​​​​: Candidates in 16 of the 28 circuit court races are virtually assured to breeze onto the bench, where they could decide who goes to prison, holds a driver’s license or keeps their kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zooming in&lt;/b&gt;: Some candidates on a glide path have liabilities that might hurt them in a contested race, including one with an arrest record, another with a history of failing to pay income taxes and a third who only recently moved to Cook County. All four vacancies in the 13th subcircuit, which covers the far Northwest suburbs, are uncontested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjljtdd-l-u/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;IMMIGRATION ✶&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-9d0000\" name=\"image-9d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/13f2ca3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1046x587+0+55/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa0%2F98%2Fa811847e485c81074ba7ebf1c73b%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-14-at-10-32-45-pm.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4dd4b95/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1046x587+0+55/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa0%2F98%2Fa811847e485c81074ba7ebf1c73b%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-14-at-10-32-45-pm.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3880264/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1046x587+0+55/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa0%2F98%2Fa811847e485c81074ba7ebf1c73b%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-14-at-10-32-45-pm.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Ruben Torres Maldonado is shown with his two children and wife, Sandibell Hidalgo.Provided\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3880264/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1046x587+0+55/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa0%2F98%2Fa811847e485c81074ba7ebf1c73b%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-14-at-10-32-45-pm.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d399afc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1046x587+0+55/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa0%2F98%2Fa811847e485c81074ba7ebf1c73b%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-14-at-10-32-45-pm.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3880264/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1046x587+0+55/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa0%2F98%2Fa811847e485c81074ba7ebf1c73b%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-14-at-10-32-45-pm.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ofelia Giselle Torres Hidalgo, center, with her family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjljtdd-l-o/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Teen who battled cancer while fighting for dad’s release from ICE detention dies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;By &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjljtdd-l-b/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Elleiana Green&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjljtdd-l-n/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Violet Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Young Chicagoan&lt;/b&gt;: Ofelia Giselle Torres Hidalgo, a 16-year-old Chicagoan who successfully fought for her father’s release from federal immigration detainment, reportedly died Friday. A&amp;nbsp;junior at Lake View High School, Ofelia had been battling metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare and aggressive soft tissue cancer, since December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key context&lt;/b&gt;: A day after she was released for the weekend from Lurie Children’s Hospital to see family and friends in mid-October, her father, Ruben Torres Maldonado, was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement&amp;nbsp;in Niles.

The chief sponsor of the ban,&amp;nbsp;Southwest Side Ald. Marty Quinn, said he wouldn’t try for an override.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key context&lt;/b&gt;: Quinn’s decision to throw in the towel means that hemp-derived products can continue to be sold in Chicago — at least until a federal ban takes effect later this year.&amp;nbsp;The ban on most hemp products was aimed at keeping unregulated intoxicants out of reach from minors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In other news&lt;/b&gt;: Hundreds of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjljtdd-l-f/\"  target=\"_blank\"

Bey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Nightmare' experience&lt;/b&gt;: The celebrated visual artist Judy Chicago has walked away from a major commission at Google’s headquarters project in the Loop, comparing working with the tech giant to \"a nightmare.\"&amp;nbsp;The job included creating a new decorative skin to adorn the atrium’s exposed 17-story elevator system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key context&lt;/b&gt;: The artist,&amp;nbsp;born Judith Sylvia Cohen, along with her husband and collaborator,&amp;nbsp;architect and photographer Donald Woodman, were picked in September to create a new terrazzo tile atrium floor at the base of the building. Renovation work has shifted to the interior of the former James R.

About 15 participants burned off steam by snapping, sawing and burning buckthorn, an invasive tree threatening native plants and wildlife in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Branded as an \"anti-Valentine’s Day\" affair in \"nature’s rage room,\" the event was part of the aquarium’s regular \"action days\" to restore and safeguard forest preserves and other natural areas. Volunteers included singles, groups of friends and even couples. They worked for a few hours atop an ephemeral pond, which is dry during winter months. And they were rewarded with cookies, a heart-shaped box of chocolates, lollipops and s’mores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though participants admitted to the stress relief benefits, no one was especially angry or broken-hearted. They were more interested in the opportunity to spend Valentine’s Day in a unique way and do their part to help the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It’s a really fun and engaging way to get people to learn about the harmful things in our environment, what they can do to make an impact for their local spaces, and also a really great way to connect with other people with similar interests,\" Shedd Aquarium's Evelyn Alvarez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjljtdd-l-tu/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;DAILY QUESTION ☕️&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, we asked you:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjljtdd-l-il/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;How do you save money while grocery shopping?

Has there even been a top 50?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s throw DeMar DeRozan in that group for argument's sake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his first year with DeRozan – likely a Hall of Famer – Donovan helped the veteran play some of the best all-around basketball of his 17-year career, all the while knowing that DeRozan’s mid-range game was going the way of the dodo bird, soon to be made extinct by an up-tempo, pace and space brand of basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s about where the list ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikola Vucevic was an All-Star caliber player for a time, while Zach LaVine dipped his toe in the pool a few seasons, but the overall grocery bag of talent Donovan has been handed has way more spoiled milk and moldy cheese than fine bottles of wine in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can Donovan do with elite talent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, he took Oklahoma City to the Western Conference Finals in 2016, and even had a 3-1 lead over the dynasty that was the Warriors, before a meltdown ensued and Kevin Durant decided a few months later it was easier to join Golden State than try and beat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And all Donovan did with elite talent at Florida was build it into a college basketball powerhouse, evident with back-to-back National Championships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s in the Hall of Fame for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way Karnisovas is getting into the Hall of Fame is buying a ticket at the admissions booth, and now he’s asking Donovan, 60, to use these final 27 games to help the front office make roster decisions moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means he’s asking Donovan to lower the expectations of winning that the coach carries around like a badge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this what Donovan signed up for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last elite coach to clean up the mistakes of a Bulls front office was Tom Thibodeau, and that ended with a knife in the back and cardboard box of office materials left at the loading dock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, however, Donovan is saying the right things and trying to turn his focus from winning to something positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I like it from the perspective of can we really, really help these guys?” Donovan said, when asked if this season was one of the bigger coaching challenges he’s gone through. “Because there are a lot of guys that have contracts and things like that, and you want to be able to help guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, I haven’t necessarily gone through anything like this, so it is challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;",

I love the city, I love the coaching staff and the men that I work with. That’s out of my control, but if I had it my way, I’d be back. I don’t want to play nowhere else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson played a major part in Swift’s success and his desire to remain with the Bears, which was interesting given their history. While Johnson has maintained he has always seen high potential in Swift, he was part of the Lions’ coaching staff when they traded him to the Eagles for a fourth-round pick in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Swift’s first season with the Bears, albeit amid dysfunction in coach Matt Eberflus’ staff and with a struggling offensive line, he often seemed too reliant on running laterally to look for big gains rather than hitting the holes quickly. Swift has said he didn’t change his running style at all this season, but his yards per carry jumped from 3.8 to 4.9 in a more effective system and with a significantly upgraded offensive line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First of all, Ben always believed in me as a player, so just him giving me opportunities was great,” Swift said. “The more opportunities I’m given, the more I can make stuff happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to deny the impact of former running backs coach Eric Bieniemy as well, and Swift said he was “sad to see him leave” for the Chiefs as offensive coordinator. The Bears have agreed to hire veteran coach Eric Studesville to replace him, and Swift was “excited for this new relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bieniemy helped the Bears establish a surprisingly solid backfield tandem with Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai. Going into the season &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2025/07/25/can-bears-dandre-swift-be-the-running-back-new-coach-ben-johnson-needs\"   &gt;there were doubts from the outside on whether either was what the Bears needed&lt;/a&gt;, but those two led the way as the team finished third in the NFL in rushing at 144.5 yards per game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift finished 12th in the league in rushing, and Monangai, a seventh-round pick, ran for 783 yards — fifth in his draft class and 24th in the NFL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upside for Swift, who is still in the ideal window for a running back after turning 27 last month, is he believes he can produce even more in Johnson’s offense than he showed last season. He caught a career-low 34 passes for 299 yards and a touchdown, and when playing for Johnson in 2021, he put up 452 yards and two touchdowns on 62 catches. The Lions targeted him 78 times that season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can do more,” he said. “I wish I would’ve been able to contribute a little more in the passing game. We’ve got so many pass-catchers on the field, so whenever it does come up, I try to make something happen with it, but I do know I could do more.”&lt;/p&gt;",

El año pasado, el cáncer avanzó a la etapa 4, y comenzó a recibir tratamientos de quimioterapia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mediados de octubre, un día después de ser liberada por el fin de semana del Lurie’s Children Hospital para ver a su familia y amigos, su papá, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/25/ruben-torres-maldonado-daughter-battling-cancer-judge-ruling\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Rubén Torres Maldonado, fue detenido&lt;/a&gt; por agentes de ICE en Niles. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.suntimeswire.com/2025/10/25/ruben-torres-maldonado-daughter-battling-cancer-judge-ruling\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Los médicos dijeron&lt;/a&gt; que ella no pudo continuar con el tratamiento “debido al estrés y la interrupción” causados por el arresto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-3a0000\" name=\"module-3a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tras demandas generalizadas por su liberación, incluido &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reels/DP-PGMHjWQ-/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;un video realizado por Ofelia&lt;/a&gt; en las redes sociales, a finales de octubre &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2025/10/31/liberan-de-custodia-de-ice-a-papa-de-adolescente-de-chicago-que-lucha-contra-el-cancer\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Maldonado fue liberado bajo fianza&lt;/a&gt; de la detención del Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ofelia fue heroica y valiente frente a la detención de ICE y la amenaza de deportación de su padre”, dijo Kalman Resnick, el abogado que representa a Torres, en un comunicado el sábado. “Lamentamos el fallecimiento de Ofelia y esperamos que ella sirva como modelo para todos nosotros sobre cómo ser valientes y luchar por lo que es correcto hasta nuestro último aliento”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El martes, un juez de inmigración en Chicago permitió condicionalmente a su padre recibir una “cancelación de la expulsión”, debido al impacto que tendría su deportación en sus hijos, quienes son ciudadanos estadounidenses. Según el comunicado de prensa, esto le brindaría un camino hacia la residencia permanente legal y eventualmente a la ciudadanía estadounidense. Ofelia pudo ver la audiencia de su padre a través de Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Se inició una página de &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/stand-with-ofelia-support-her-family-now\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; para Ofelia en octubre y ha recaudado más de $123,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le sobreviven su padre, su madre y su hermano menor, Nathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El domingo, la senadora estatal Graciela Guzmán, demócrata por Chicago, dijo que encontró algo de consuelo al saber que Ofelia pudo ver a su padre en un camino hacia la ciudadanía después de luchar con su enfermedad para abogar por su liberación. Sin embargo, Guzmán dijo que la lucha de Ofelia contra el cáncer resaltó el costo del tiempo en las familias separadas por los agentes de la administración de Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Se merecía ver todo llegar a buen término de esa manera”, comentó Guzmán. “Estábamos luchando para que él regresara porque nada estaba garantizado, y estoy agradecida de que tuvieron un par de meses extra.  Pero estoy segura de que lamentan el tiempo perdido. No hay días que recuperes, y no hay cantidad de dinero que puedas poner en ese tiempo”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dijo que ve a Ofelia como “un llamado para que seamos valientes”, pero le preocupa el costo de la actual ofensiva federal de inmigración a nivel nacional en los niños, específicamente en los hijos de inmigrantes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guzmán dice que cuando regrese a Springfield la próxima semana, estará buscando opciones para honrar a Ofelia a través de la Legislatura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A los niños de familias inmigrantes ya se les pide hacer tanto”, agregó Guzmán. “Lamento profundamente que un sistema estuviera tan roto que la carga tuviera que recaer en una adolescente para ponerle un espejo, y deberíamos sentirnos avergonzados por eso. No debió estar viviendo sus últimos meses pensando si su papá estaría aquí, o testificando en sus últimos días, pero ese es el legado que deja”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El domingo en un comunicado, el alcalde Brandon Johnson dijo que la historia de la familia Torres es “demasiado similar al terror y trauma que se ha impuesto a innumerables familias en Chicago”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Su valentía frente a fuerzas poderosas que han sido diseñadas para generar miedo, incertidumbre y división nos muestra quiénes somos en nuestro mejor momento: compasivos sin condición, firmes en nuestro compromiso con la justicia, y valientes a pesar de todas las adversidades”, destacó Johnson en el comunicado. “Esta campaña indiscriminada y llena de prejuicios que ha alterado las vidas de familias trabajadoras que llegaron a Chicago, y a otras ciudades del país, en busca de una vida mejor, debe llegar a su fin”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

There's a lot of things going in the right direction. We've got a lot of good young stars and exciting young players, and that's all going well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are some challenges. The regional sports network model has been under pressure for the last few years. Certain teams felt it the most this offseason, and it'll take a while for it to work out, but it's certainly a challenge for the entire league.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs’ in-house network, Marquee Sports Network – which is operated by the team and Sinclair – hasn’t been immune. Launched in 2020, its first season was just 60 games long, shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, the network went &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports-media/2025/12/01/cubs-marquee-sports-network-general-manager-diane-penny-colin-faulkner-crane-kenney-regional-sports-network-comcast\"   &gt;through a round of layoffs this offseason &lt;/a&gt;that slashed its digital department and eliminated the GM position. This spring, Marquee is scheduled to broadcast just 11 Cactus League Games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given all the market headwinds for RSNs, Marquee was one of the best things we ever did,” Ricketts still said Monday. “To be in control of our own destiny and be able to produce the games we want to produce the way we want to produce them, with the right people and the right staff and the right level of production quality. For us, it's been a huge home run.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a moment of meta cinema, a Marquee camera was nestled among the gathered reporters, capturing his comments. Despite the cuts, Ricketts didn’t falter in his praise, saying that starting the network was “maybe the smartest thing we've done in all these years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Very happy with the product,” he said. “Everyone is. We've won tons of Emmys, and we get great feedback, and we have broadcasters who are loved by the fans, and we do a great game day production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But we also have the economic realities that are facing other sports networks and the declining revenue model. So we just have to balance that out and try to focus our efforts where we can get a great experience and a great production for fans, and just being mindful of expenses, because it's getting tougher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As MLB continues to add teams’ broadcasts to its portfolio, there’s been discussion about whether the league would take over all 30 teams’ broadcasts in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's a lot of speculation on that,” Ricketts said. “I don't want to get too deep in the weeds, but we love the network, and we love our independence.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

lakefront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe a quick grill — and for a couple days only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The start of this week is giving Chicago a short respite from a snowy and cold winter that featured a 20-day stretch of subfreezing temperatures — the longest in almost two decades — and several snowstorms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a couple sunny and mild days over the weekend, the forecasted high of 61 degrees Monday would make it the warmest Feb. 16 in the city’s recorded history, with the previous record set in 1921 at 58 degrees, according to National Weather Service

time of year. “Usually this time we’re sitting in the mid-30s,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago has trudged through the cold and snow since October after a few mild winters the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city exceeded the entire 2024-25 snowfall total by the end of December this season and has accumulated 32.1 inches to this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the 20 days from Jan. 17 to Feb. 6 when temperatures didn’t rise above freezing made for the longest such stretch in Chicago since 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div

be back to 62 on Wednesday, according to the NWS forecast. If the weather errs on the warmer side, however, there’s a scenario where Monday through Thursday could all hit the 60s. That would be the warmest few February days since 2017, when temps hit the high 60s and 70s for four days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this warm stretch indicate the cold and snow are behind us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No, we just got locked into a warmer pattern here for a little bit,” Yack said. “Things may change back the other way, who knows. But it doesn’t really give us any indication one way or the other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, real Chicagoans shouldn’t be surprised to learn what could be in store for us by Friday, according to the NWS: Even more snow.&lt;/p&gt;",

You can bring in your friends…You can go take pictures. You can rent space for special events or whatever you want to do in that area. It’s multi-use. But, it’s all around sexual activity,” Business Affairs and Consumer Protection Commissioner Ivan Capifali told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re very responsible business owners. They’re not irresponsible. They came to us. They were very honest and transparent with us and we appreciate that. They explained their business model to us. There’s a lot of activities they want to do. We issued a cease-and-desist order until we can figure this out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capifali refused to identify the name or location of the alleged sex dungeon, nor would he pinpoint the Chicago neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He would only say that the business is seeking to operate in a grey area of the city’s business licensing code that “doesn’t fall into just one license category.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to figure out what to do. It’s actually making us think a little bit.

Then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Erika Csicsila said Nesbitt used email accounts to invite clients to sex and fetish parties with names like “Black Tie Bizarre” and “Halloween Mischief.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kink Extraordinaires has been described as “the premier Dungeon of Chicago.” Its website said it offered “beautiful, psychologically sophisticated Kinksters” who “play out of a private five-floor dungeon with multiple, fully equipped themed rooms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2024/06/21/sex-dungeon-property-tax-breaks-chicago-illusions-anthony-vaughan-frank-cangelosi-dominatrix-bdsm-fritz-kaegi\"   &gt;Sex dungeon on Near West Side has gotten property tax breaks for decades&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2024, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2024/06/21/sex-dungeon-property-tax-breaks-chicago-illusions-anthony-vaughan-frank-cangelosi-dominatrix-bdsm-fritz-kaegi\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;the Sun-Times reported&lt;/a&gt; that Chicago Illusions, a sex dungeon that advertises “BDSM” services: bondage and discipline, dominance and submission and sadism and masochism had taken advantage of a Cook County program to give tax breaks to owners of small storefront building that also have apartments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner of that kinky business used the program to cut his real estate taxes by 60 percent a year for a total tax savings of nearly $300,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s all because the building has a pair of four-room apartments upstairs. Those apartments allow the whole building to be taxed as residential property rather than commercial — at a sharply lower tax rate than businesses have to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The apartments are leased by the operator of Chicago Illusions, according to records the property owner filed with Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi.&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;The sex dungeon advertises “BDSM” services: bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vaughan, the dungeon’s operator, said he doesn’t use the apartments for his sex business, which he says is limited to the 1,450-square-foot ground floor retail space at 1210 W.

Crow-Armstrong has been in USA Baseball’s system since 12U. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can look back 12 years ago, and I played with Paul Skenes before he was a pitcher,” Crow-Armstrong said in a recent conversation with the Sun-Times. “I played with Masyn Winn before he was a Gold Glove shortstop. Carson Tucker is still one of my best friends to this day, and we met on the USA team.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Crow-Armstrong, this season will be about building off a breakout 2025 that had extreme highs and an extended low. But before that, he’ll get his first taste of the professional national team, on a roster stacked with MLB talent, including three Cubs: Crow-Armstrong, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/13/what-pete-crow-armstrong-can-learn-from-his-cubs-and-team-usa-teammate-alex-bregman\"   &gt;third baseman Alex Bregman&lt;/a&gt; and left-handed pitcher Matthew Boyd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This WBC, the United States is set to feature its best pitching staff ever, with Skenes and Tarik Skubal, reigning Cy Youngs, headlining a stacked rotation, and closer Mason Miller leading the bullpen. The position-player group features Aaron Judge and Cal Raleigh, who finished first and second in the AL MVP race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong has vivid memories of his dad praising center fielder Byron Buxton, now a Team USA Teammate.  “He is Mike Trout if he can stay healthy,” Matthew John Armstrong would say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So the thought of me platooning with Byron Buxton is sort of hard to fathom,” Crow-Armstrong said, “but super freaking cool.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, USA Baseball brought Crow-Armstrong all over the world. He now fondly reminisces about sneaking out to explore Busan, South Korea. He was taken in by Cartagena, Columbia’s famous fortress. He’s talked with Cubs teammate Miguel Amaya about playing in Chitre, Panama, Amaya’s hometown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What was so significant about Team USA experiences for me was, it's a much shorter window to really come together and all buy into the same thing,” Crow-Armstrong said. “And that never changed throughout 12[U] to 15 to 18.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong returns, this time with the professional national team, after a rollercoaster of a 2025 season that still saw him record 31 home runs and 35 stolen bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong was stalwart on defense all year, earning his first career Gold Glove. On offense, he put up MVP numbers in the first half, earning a no-brainer start in the All-Star game. But he slumped down the stretch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The steps we've taken with the swing over the last three plus years has been incredible, and I'm very proud of that,” Crow-Armstrong said in the middle of a scrum of reporters and cameras last week. “What I'm not so proud of yet is the .280 on-base percentage and the 55% swing rate, or whatever it was. That's no fun. I had a lot of a lot more fun when I was playing well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sold himself a little short with those figures. Last year, he posted a .287 OBP and a 53.5 out of zone swing %, according to Statcast, leaving plenty of room for improvement with his pitch selection. He also zeroed in this offseason on repeating his setup, stepping into the batter's box with the exact same routine every pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crow-Armstrong will get continued instruction on those focuses in Cubs camp. And then with the national team, he’ll have the chance to pick the brains of some of the best hitters in the world. Team USA is also the favorite in the tournament, promising high-intensity playing environments, especially in the later rounds. That kind of experience is hard to replicate outside of playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Crow-Armstrong: “What I've been told is, there's nothing like the sights and sounds of the WBC.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

I love that excitement.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks to play in the WBC started last season with former coach Drew Butera (now with the Blue Jays), and former hitting coach Marcus Thames helped Teel take the necessary steps to play for Team Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teel admitted he was surprised by the layers of paperwork needed to play in the WBC. “There was a lot I had to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Three’s a crowd&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teel’s departure will allow more playing time for Edgar Quero and Korey Lee with the likelihood that the Sox will carry only two catchers on their opening day roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee has been fielding grounders, but Venable all but ruled out carrying a third catcher in a utility role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, bench coach Walker McKinven has taken over the catching duties, and Venable likes the friendly competition among the three catchers, with Teel expected to handle the majority of the catching duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of us lean on each other in different ways,” Teel said. “Korey is the older one in the group. We lean on him for certain things, like, whether it's routine (stuff). Q can really back-pick. So we talked to him about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We all have our own strengths. I feel like we feed each other with that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Solid gold&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bullpen catcher Bennett Markinson sported the first “Cash Money Coach of the Day” chain during Monday’s workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea came from Venable through Astros assistant hitting coach Anthony Iapoce when they coached with the Cubs in 2019-20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presentation is made during the daily staff meeting prior to each workout in honor of a staff member who has deserved recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's a nice moment to talk about in there, and then you have to wear the chain,” Venable said. “Hopefully, people are asking you why you are wearing this big awful chain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was quite the early impression for Markinson, who batted .266 with a .783 OPS in 52 games for Northwestern last season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

He saved a bullpen that posted a 4.16 ERA with 24 blown saves from further despair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vasil posted a 2.00 ERA in 44 relief appearances, including 14 of at least three innings. He was used exclusively as a reliever in late June after posting a 6.55 ERA in three consecutive starts in which he allowed three home runs in 11 innings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after being dispatched to the bullpen, Vasil threw a career-high 5 1/3 innings and allowed only one earned run in his next appearance after being demoted from the rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vasil showed no signs of fading, as he posted a 2.54 ERA in 22 appearances in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key for Vasil, and the Sox, is his continued success with his 94 mph sinker that produced a 51.4% ground-ball rate, which plays well in hitter-friendly Rate Field and compensates for his 19.4% strikeout rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love ground balls and realizing that it's a weapon, especially in today's game where a lot of guys are obviously trying to hit the ball in the air,” Vasil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox could use more efficiency from their rotation after their starters threw only 53.5% of the team’s 1,416 innings in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s got the physical capability of doing it,” Sox manager Will Venable said. “We asked him to do a lot of different things last year — pitch a little bit of length, some shorter stints, and he was able to respond to everything and really earned that right to come to camp to compete for a starting job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to give him a shot to do that, and we also know that as this thing all comes together, he’s going to do a lot of different things for us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, Davis Martin and Anthony Kay (who signed a two-year deal) appear entrenched in the Sox’ rotation, leaving two spots open. Erick Fedde signed a one-year deal last week but needs to regain his 2024 form before the Sox traded him to the Cardinals at the July trade deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves Vasil having a semblance of a shot for at least one spot in the rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't know what the team plans on having him do, but like as a catcher, you see him attacking hitters early and often,” said Kyle Teel, who caught Vasil at the University of Virginia and last year with the Sox. “That's a really great quality that he has.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vasil knows there are no guarantees, especially after what he experienced last spring. He was a Rule 5 pick of the Phillies in a pre-arranged pick before selling him to the Rays, who waived him shortly before the end of spring training before the Sox claimed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I realized that I'm able to do a lot of things, and that's valuable,” said Vasil, who spent his first four seasons in the Mets’ organization. “But at the end of the day, I'm a team guy. It's team over me.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

That means there will be plenty of opportunities to shift the Coach of the Year race in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here is a short list of prime Coach of the Year candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mike Bailey, St. Patrick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey led St. Pat’s to a third-place finish in 3A last season. He’s doing an even better job this year after four starters departed, including all three guards. The 23-4 Shamrocks have shot up the rankings after being unranked in the preseason and are contending with Benet and Marist for a league title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brandin Brown, Homewood-Flossmoor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown is authoring one of the best first-year coaching jobs that you’ll see. He’s guided the Vikings to a 25-3 record and done so with only one returning starter from last season. He’s utilized point guard Darrius Hawkins in the best way possible while the supporting cast has blended together nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mike Dunn, York&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one saw 26-4 coming from the Dukes. Throw in a possible conference title and it’s been arguably the biggest surprise of the season. There was some experience and size returning in the frontcourt, but the rest, especially in the backcourt, was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mike Ellis, Evanston&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, Evanston was ranked in the preseason top 25. But remember, the Wildkits were replacing four starters from last year’s team that reached the 4A state semifinals. The Wildkits have 23 wins and ran away with the CSL South while earning a No. 2 sectional seed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gene Heidkamp, Benet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already a two-time Coach of the Year winner, Heidkamp is worthy of a spot on this list most seasons. The Redwings have dominated more than anyone expected, especially after losing two Division I players from last season's state championship team. Top-ranked Benet has also thrived while playing with a bulls-eye on its back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tom Kleinschmidt, DePaul Prep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kleinschmidt has earned this honor two other times. He’s worthy of consideration again. What if Kleinschmidt steers DePaul to a fourth straight state championship while playing in the state’s largest class for the first time? The preseason No. 1 team has lost to just one in-state team all season, Benet, while playing with the added pressure of being the hunted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Eric Millstone, Palatine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s about maximizing talent, and perhaps no one has done a better job of it than Millstone. The Pirates don’t boast scholarship-type talent, yet here they are with a sparkling 25-4 record. They play smart, decisive basketball and don’t beat themselves, thanks in large part to the veteran coach of 18 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matt Monroe, St. Ignatius&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wolfpack began the season ranked No. 23 in the preseason. But Monroe needed to replace last year’s star, Phoenix Gill, and blend returning senior Chris Bolte with some talented youth. Mission accomplished as St. Ignatius has climbed the rankings and won 25 games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mike Oliver, Curie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death, taxes and Curie winning 25 games. Yes, the consistency has been remarkable for Oliver’s program over two decades. But that shouldn’t take anything away from the job he’s done with this particular group that sits 24-1 and is favored to win a city title this week.&lt;/p&gt;",

To me, he was simply everything,” Luciana Duvall wrote. “His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court. For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bald, wiry Duvall didn't have leading man looks, but few \"character actors\" enjoyed such a long, rewarding and unpredictable career, in leading and supporting roles, from an itinerant preacher to Josef Stalin. Beginning with his 1962 film debut as Boo Radley, the reclusive neighbor in \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" Duvall created a gallery of unforgettable portrayals. They earned him seven Academy Award nominations and the best actor prize for \"Tender Mercies,\" which came out in 1983. He also won four Golden Globes, including one for playing the philosophical cattle-drive boss in the 1989 miniseries \"Lonesome Dove,\" a role he often cited as his favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Robert Duvall (1931-2026): &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/CsfbsxmhlO\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CsfbsxmhlO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Michael Beschloss (@BeschlossDC) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BeschlossDC/status/2023458860736901165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 16, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Duvall was awarded a National Medal of Arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had been acting for nearly 20 years when \"The Godfather,\" released in 1972, established him as one of the most in-demand performers of Hollywood. He had made a previous film, \"The Rain People,\" with Francis Coppola, and the director chose him to play Tom Hagen in the mafia epic that featured Al Pacino and Marlon Brando among others. Duvall was a master of subtlety as an Irishman among Italians, rarely at the center of a scene, but often listening and advising in the background, an irreplaceable thread through the saga of the Corleone crime family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stars and Italians alike depend on his efficiency, his tidying up around their grand gestures, his being the perfect shortstop on a team of personality sluggers,” wrote the critic David Thomson. “Was there ever a role better designed for its actor than that of Tom Hagen in both parts of ‘The Godfather?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another Coppola film, \"Apocalypse Now,\" Duvall was wildly out front, the embodiment of deranged masculinity as Lt. Col. Bill Kilgore, who with equal vigor enjoyed surfing and bombing raids on the Viet Cong. Duvall required few takes for one of the most famous passages in movie history, barked out on the battlefield by a bare-chested, cavalry-hatted Kilgore: \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for 12 hours. When it was all over, I walked up. We didn’t find one of ‘em, not one stinkin’ dink body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The smell, you know that gasoline smell, the whole hill. Smelled like — victory.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coppola once commented about Duvall: \"Actors click into character at different times — the first week, third week. Bobby's hot after one or two takes.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Honored, but still hungry&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was Oscar nominated as supporting actor for “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now,” but a dispute over money led him to turn down the third Godfather epic, a loss deeply felt by critics, fans and \"Godfather\" colleagues. Duvall would complain publicly about being offered less than his co-stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow actors marveled at Duvall's studious research and planning, and his coiled energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Caine, who co-starred with him in 2003's \"Secondhand Lions,\" once told The Associated Press: \"Before a big scene, Bobby just sits there, absolutely quiet; you know when not to talk to him.\" Anyone who disturbed him would suffer the well-known Duvall temper, famously on display during the filming of the John Wayne Western “True Grit,” when Duvall seethed at director Henry Hathaway's advice to “tense up” before a scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"InstagramUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DU1IhniEk5r/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In 1998, he was nominated for best actor in \"The Apostle,\" a drama about a wayward Southern evangelist which he wrote, directed, starred in, produced and largely financed. With customary thoroughness, he visited dozens of country churches and spent 12 years writing the script and trying to get it made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other notable roles: the outlaw gang leader who gets ambushed by John Wayne in \"True Grit\"; Jesse James in \"The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid\"; the pious and beleaguered Frank Burns in \"M*A*S*H\"; the TV hatchet man in \"Network\"; Dr. Watson in \"The Seven-Per-Cent Solution\"; and the sadistic father in \"The Great Santini.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I was doing ‘Colors’ in 1988 with Sean Penn, someone asked me how I do it all these years, keep it fresh. Well, if you don’t overwork, have some hobbies, you can do it and stay hungry even if you’re not really hungry,\" Duvall told The Associated Press in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his mid-80s, he received a supporting Oscar nomination as the title character of the 2014 release “The Judge,” in which he is accused of causing a death in a hit-and-run accident. More recent films included “Widows” and “12 Mighty Orphans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ungifted in school, gifted on stage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Selden Duvall grew up in Annapolis, Maryland, and the San Diego area, where he was born in 1931. He spent time in other cities as his father, who rose to be a Navy admiral, was assigned to various duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy's experience helped in his adult profession as he learned the nuances of regional speech and observed the psyche of military men, which he would portray in several films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duvall reportedly used his Navy officer father as the basis for his portrayal of the explosive militarist in \"The Great Santini,” based on the Pat Conroy novel. He commented in 2003: \"My dad was a gentleman but a seether, a stern, blustery guy, and away a lot of the time.\" Bobby took after his mother, an amateur actress, in playing a guitar and performing. He was a wrestler like his father and enjoyed besting kids older than himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lacked the concentration for schoolwork and nearly flunked out of Principia College in Elsah, Illinois. His despairing parents decided he needed something to keep him in college so he wouldn't be drafted for the Korean War. \"They recommended acting as an expedient thing to get through,\" he recalled. \"I'm glad they did.\" He flourished in drama classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Way back when I was in college,\" Duvall told the AP in 1990, \"there was a wonderful man named Frank Parker, who had been a dancer in World War I. We did a full-length mime play and I played a Harlequin clown. I really liked that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Then, I played an older guy in 'All My Sons,' and at one point I had this emotional moment, where this emotion was pouring out. Parker said at that moment he didn't think acting can be carried any further than that. And this guy was a very critical guy. So I thought, at that moment at least, this is what I wanted to do.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two years in the Army, he used the G.I. Bill to finance his studies at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York, hanging out with such other young hopefuls as Robert Morse, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman. After a one-night performance in \"A View From the Bridge,\" Duvall began getting offers for work in TV series, among them \"The Naked City\" and \"The Defenders.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between his high-paying jobs in major productions, Duvall devoted himself to directing personal projects: a documentary about a prairie family, “We're Not the Jet Set”; a film about gypsies, “Angelo, My Love”; and \"Assassination Tango,\" in which he also starred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duvall had been a tango dancer since seeing the musical \"Tango Argentina\" in the 1980s and visited Argentina dozens of times to study the dance and the culture. The result was the 2003 release about a hit man with a passion for tango.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His co-star was Luciana Pedraza, 42 years his junior, whom he married in 2005. Duvall's three previous marriages — to Barbara Benjamin, Gail Youngs and Sharon Brophy — ended in divorce.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
