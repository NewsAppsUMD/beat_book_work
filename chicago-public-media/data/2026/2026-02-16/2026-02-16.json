The Broncos hounded Butler and made every shot difficult for the Lynx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"One thing that always travels well is good defense,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Broncos bring that defensive tenacity into the state playoffs, the Broncos will be a formidable team going forward. You can project what seniors Danielle Brooks (16.3 points per game) and Darreyelle Smith (9.6 points and 7.7 rebounds) are going to bring. offensively. But it was the Broncos' supporting cast that was impressive on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freshman Janiah Daniel was impressive in her ability to attack the glass. She did a solid job of catching passes around the rim, and if she continues to improve as a finisher, she'll give the Broncos another offensive threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defending state champions open the IHSA Class 4A state playoffs against Lindblom on Monday, and if Kenwood wins, it would face Hinsdale Central on Thursday for the regional championship. The true showdown would come in a potential sectional semifinal matchup against Downers Grove North.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;IHSA State playoffs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;IHSA State playoffs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hinsdale Central sectional is stacked with competition. The top-six seeds are Nazareth, Downers Grove North, Kenwood, Lyons, St. Ignatius and Young. It's a loaded field that could set up some intriguing matchups as the playoffs progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If both Lyons and St. Ignatius each win their semifinal games, it'll set up a regional finals matchup between the two teams. The Wolfpack are battle-tested after making it to the Class 3A state championship last season. Senior guard Gabby Hinton is a stabilizing force, and junior forward Kaylee Clarke is averaging eight points and 10 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyons has dealt with injuries, most notably to senior forward Emma O'Brien, which is a big loss for the Lions because of O'Brien's ability to score in a multitude of ways while anchoring the defense. Without her, the Lions still have enough to advance in the playoffs with senior forward Gwen Smith and freshman guard Kennedy Moore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Nazareth beats Riverside-Brookfield on Tuesday, then it will have one of the toughest regional finals matchups if Young beats Reavis. Young has been a roller-coaster this season, but they were able to finish the CPS portion of its season emphatically with a 51-36 win over Lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young has a two-headed duo at guard with sophomores Harmony Cooper and Yanni Smith. Sophomore forward Jordyn Ellis is an athletic forward who can make a considerable impact with her length whenever she’s on the floor. Junior forward Neelah Leech is also an important connector on both ends of the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A potential Young-Nazareth matchup would be very intriguing. Nazareth is one of the best teams in the area, but has had moments of offensive stagnation. But the Roadrunners are an experienced group led by BYU commit Stella Sakalas, one of the area's best players. She is a dynamic talent who has demonstrated that she can be a force in the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Super 25, with record and last week’s ranking:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Nazareth (28-3) 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. 1 seed in Hinsdale Central sectional&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2.

Tuesday's high will be 48 degrees, and temperatures are expected to drop toward the end of the week with highs in the 30s and 40s, with a possibility of rain Tuesday and Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mid-February average temperatures usually hover around the 30s with potential to dip to frigid temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A record could be set Monday if the temperature at O'Hare Airport surpasses 58 degrees, the warmest temperature recorded for Feb. 16, set more than a century ago in 1921. Temperatures the rest of the week are expected to be unseasonably warm, but the area probably won't break records later in the week.

It’s Michigan, man&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Arizona having lost two in a row — not to mention hotshot freshman Koa Peat to an unspecified injury — Michigan will be the no-doubt-about-it new No. 1-ranked team on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of us already thought the Wolverines (24-1) were the best team, just saying. They’ve won 10 straight. They trailed by 16 in the second half at Northwestern last week, yet still won by a dozen. They came back Saturday and blew out UCLA by 30. When this team — off to the best start in school history — puts the pedal down, it’s flippin’ scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and guess who plays at Purdue on Tuesday?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/college-sports/2026/02/15/illinois-keaton-wagler-david-mrkovic-kasparas-jakucionis-will-riley-terrance-shannon-illini-march-madness\"   &gt;Illini freshmen (better than last year?), NCAA potential (better than 2024?) shine through in rout of Indiana&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/college-sports/2026/02/10/college-basketball-illinois-michigan-arizona-duke-cameron-boozer-keaton-wagler\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Entering college basketball’s stretch run, here are 10 things to get you all caught up&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Purple pain&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Northwestern, loser of five straight, is tied with Penn State at the bottom of the Big Ten at 2-13. Going by conference record, it’s the worst team 13th-year coach Chris Collins has had and the worst Wildcats team since the 2007-08 squad went 1-17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wildcats did beat Penn State in late January, giving them the tiebreaker just in case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So they’ve got that going for them, which is, you know, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sooner or later&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma is on a two-game winning streak. Other than that, coach Porter Moser’s experience this season has been like an out-of-control Sooner Schooner. Did you know that losing eight straight SEC games isn’t ideal? Now Moser, the former Loyola hero, knows it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But wait — it’s his fifth straight sub-.500 SEC season since leaving Rogers Park for the big-time. Things just aren’t working. His seat is hot. There are fans shouting for his dismissal. Any chance football can start half a year early? That might be the only thing that would save him. That, or an out-of-nowhere SEC tournament title run.

People will listen to you. Privately, however, something going on behind the scenes could promote accident-prone behavior. Be careful.
