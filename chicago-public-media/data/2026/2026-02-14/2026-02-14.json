The Purdue-bound defensive lineman was also the focal point of the basketball team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had high expectations early in the year and when Max went down, it threw us completely off,” coach Don Houston said. “We had to learn how to play without him. He was a potential all-stater.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carmicle’s injury meant major minutes for 6-7 junior Terrence Richardson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Terrence was a 5-9, B-team player in his freshman year,” Houston said. “He just stretched out and then he had to learn how to play with his length.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richardson didn’t have the physical mindset for post play early in the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Terrence started out the season soft,” Hillcrest guard Jamir Ratliff said. “But he got a tougher mindset and got better from there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richardson scored seven points and grabbed 13 rebounds in the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/super-25-basketball-rankings/2026/02/08/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;No. 25 Hawks’ &lt;/a&gt;60-49 victory at Lemont on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/13/chicago-illinois-high-school-basketball-scores\"   &gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We put a lot of work into toughening him up,” Houston said. “He’s been doing a great job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The softness is gone now, and Richardson plays like a promising college prospect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been up and down and up and down this season,” Richardson said. “It’s been a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-5e0000\" name=\"image-5e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b454a5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F20%2F79fc734d440088c3e2124d452b4d%2Fob-cst-021426-7003.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/981ec81/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F20%2F79fc734d440088c3e2124d452b4d%2Fob-cst-021426-7003.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/843fec8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F20%2F79fc734d440088c3e2124d452b4d%2Fob-cst-021426-7003.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Hillcrest&amp;#x27;s Terrence Richardson (12) gets fouled but makes this shot in the first half of the Hawks&amp;#x27;

Ratliff scored 17 points against Lemont to crack the 1,000-point mark in his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hitting 1,000 feels good, but it was never really the goal,” Ratliff said. “It just happened naturally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophomore Ja’Sean Greene added 14 points for Hillcrest with some dynamic moves to the basket and senior point guard Jamari Thomas handled Lemont’s pressure with grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Greene] has been playing like that all season,” Houston said. “He gives us solid minutes and he’s probably our best defender. He’s only going to continue to get better. He will step up huge for us next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemont (15-12, 9-3) jumped out to a 19-9 lead and still led 29-28 at halftime but only scored one field goal in the first 12 minutes of the second half as Hillcrest took control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior Zane Schneider led Lemont with 22 points, and 6-5 senior Ryan Crane added 11 points and seven rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hillcrest joined the Super 25 on Sunday after knocking off Kenwood by 22 points last week. The Hawks’ only losses in 2026 are to York and Curie, and they played the Condors tough, losing by just two points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are playing to the competition level,” Houston said. “But overall, we are starting to find ourselves now. It is state or bust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hillcrest hosts a Class 3A sectional. The Hawks are the No. 2 seed behind Leo, and the path to Champaign looks very promising. The Illinois High School Association released the full state tournament playoff brackets on Friday evening. Crete-Monee and Thornton are the other contenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-b40000\" name=\"html-embed-module-b40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"No Shot Clock, Ep. 201: Conference quick takes\" allowtransparency=\"true\" height=\"150\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);height:150px;\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=5patj-1a40c88-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=auto&amp;logo_link=episode_page&amp;btn-skin=c73a3a\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Those keys unlocked what he called the best 1½-month offensive stretch of his life last season before a strained quad in late May broke his rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same things are focuses for Cubs center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong, especially disciplined swing decisions. That has dominated most of their hitting conversations so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I think the sky’s the limit for him,’’ Bregman said of Crow-Armstrong. ‘‘I feel like he can do anything on a baseball field: running the bases, defensively, offensively. And I feel like the more he refines his game, he’s just going to continue to get better and better.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman joined the Cubs with an already-glowing reputation for his &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/01/15/cubs-tout-alex-bregmans-leadership-as-they-enter-long-term-commitment\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;leadership skills&lt;/a&gt;. The examples keep stacking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman was in the coaches’ room earlier this week, president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer said, asking about what his teammates were working on and how he could reinforce those cues. During the offseason, young infielder Matt Shaw joined Bregman at his facility in Arizona to hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s rare to have a player that’s invested in helping make young guys better,’’ Hoyer said. ‘‘And you’ll see it in various ways, but it’s a wonderful quality that he has. It’s something people with the Astros talk about and people with the Red Sox talk about, and it’s something he’s earned.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman is expected to make an impact on the Cubs all season. But because of the World Baseball Classic schedule this spring, there’s one young position player he’ll be around more than any other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I’m really excited to spend some serious time with him,’’ Crow-Armstrong said of Bregman, who will join him on Team USA. ‘‘The guy is super-enthusiastic about the intricacies of the game. And I’ve loved hearing him share his experiences in the past. And I think he’s going to make me and the whole squad just a whole lot better.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman and Crow-Armstrong were early arrivals in camp. And though Bregman left the complex Thursday with an illness, he was back Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two have about two more weeks left with the Cubs before joining Team USA for WBC play. It will be Crow-Armstrong’s first WBC and Bregman’s second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Bregman was the youngest player on Team USA’s squad, turning 23 about a week after the team beat Puerto Rico in the final. The next time around, in 2023, Bregman couldn’t participate after breaking a finger in the World Series several months before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I didn’t get to play that much [in 2017], but I got to experience it,’’ Bregman said. ‘‘And I’ve been looking forward to this since then.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman can pass lessons from that early experience to the 23-year-old Crow-Armstrong, but the two will have more time for general baseball conversations, too. Pitch selection is sure to continue to be a topic between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman’s elite chase rate put him in the 95th percentile in that category last season. Crow-Armstrong, meanwhile, is well aware that he’s a free swinger and that improving his command of the strike zone is an avenue to take his offensive game to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s not the first time Pete’s talked about pitch selection,’’ Cubs manager Craig Counsell said of Crow-Armstrong’s conversations with Bregman. ‘‘But, kind of like pitch grips, how it clicks for you and how you see it and how it resonates and how you process it, it’s different for everybody.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more conversations Crow-Armstrong has with coaches or teammates who excel in that area, the more chances he will create to have that ‘‘aha’’ moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘The way Alex approaches it, he’s been successful, and it’s been successful for other players, as well,’’ Counsell said. ‘‘So of course we’re all going to listen to that.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\"

The amount parents take out in loans is sometimes more than their annual earnings, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fear is really that they're just putting these families into real financial trouble, real financial jeopardy,” Burd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report focuses on federal Parent PLUS loans, which parents can use to pay for tuition costs that can’t be covered out of pocket or through scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most federal student loans have limits, families can take out Parent PLUS loans up to the total cost of attendance. But Parent PLUS loans, which have a high fixed interest rate and origination fees, weren’t designed for low-income families, Burd said. They were meant to help middle- and upper-income families send their children to more prestigious and expensive schools, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were never intended as a way for schools to be able to help low-income students,” Burd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePaul officials say the university provides scholarships and grants and offers information about various loans but ultimately families decide what to borrow. A Loyola University spokesperson said the university \"works proactively with students and families to present all available options,\" without steering families toward any particular option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Loyola will continue strengthening resources that help families manage educational costs and minimize debt,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Parent PLUS loans, the schools are not held accountable if the borrowers go into default, and the Trump administration is expected to soon start garnishing wages from people who have defaulted on student loans after a pause on payments that started during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools can offer students merit-based scholarships based on grades and academic success, even if they don’t qualify for need-based aid. And those scholarships can end up taking up a large share of a school’s financial aid funds, leaving low-income students in need of loans — and that’s where the Parent PLUS loans come in, Burd says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem compounds, Burd says, when schools offer better financial aid packages to students whose families make more, a strategy he says is often aimed at attracting high-achieving and wealthy students who could give generous donations in the future. That incentivizes colleges to recruit students with an eye for “raising revenue for your institution and rising up the rankings,” Burd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some schools have used this practice to improve their spot in national rankings and transform themselves from a humble commuter school to a nationally competitive university, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find schools that appeared to be steering lower-income families toward Parent PLUS loans, Burd looked for colleges where a large share of students who received federal Pell Grants, which are meant for low-income students, had parents taking out Parent PLUS loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At DePaul University, 53% of students whose parents took out Parent PLUS loans were Pell Grant recipients and their parents borrowed on average $33,000 in PLUS loans, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Loyola, 48% of students whose parents have Parent PLUS loans had Pell grants. The average Parent PLUS debt taken on by those Loyola parents was around $46,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-3f0000\" name=\"image-3f0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/32606e3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/05f5575/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c844ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Loyola University Chicago campus\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c844ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d797611/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c844ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Loyola University Chicago, 48% of students whose parents have Parent PLUS loans received Pell grants for lower-income students.

The spokesperson said DePaul provides students over $350 million a year in academic scholarships and need-based grants using institutional funds and philanthropic gifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DePaul offers information to students and families regarding various loan options, and ultimately families make the decision to proceed with loans as they see fit,” the spokesperson wrote in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 41 private and public colleges and universities cited in the report collectively spent $2.4 billion of their financial aid dollars on students who didn’t need the help in 2023, the most recent data available. Nearly $2 out of every $5 spent on financial aid went to students who the federal government considers able to afford college without additional aid, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burd started with a list of more than 300 selective colleges and universities with a certain size endowment, excluding historically Black colleges and universities because he said they have been historically underfunded and have far less financial aid to give. Art schools were also excluded because they are among the most expensive schools, partly because of costly supplies and tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burd then looked for schools at which families of Pell Grant recipients made up at least one-third of PLUS loan borrowers and the median amount of loans was at least $15,000. At the 41 schools cited in the report, 45% of the borrowers were the parents of Pell recipients, and they borrowed a median amount of $29,102.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some lawmakers have noted this trend and have capped Parent PLUS loans at $65,000 per child, but Burd says that’s still too much for many families to borrow. He said ideally, legislation will be implemented to stop schools from steering families toward taking out loans they can’t afford to repay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only other worry, though, is that private lenders are going to come in and start offering even more predatory products,” he said. “So that's something we need to look out for as well.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

I just feel blessed to be out here.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's top-ranked Class 3A 165-pounder according to Illinois Matmen, Kelly won three technical falls in less than six minutes of mat time to move closer to another trip downstate. He can punch his ticket Saturday for the 3A state finals, which run next Thursday through Saturday at State Farm Center in Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His path seemed blocked on Jan. 31 when officials at the Morton Regional wouldn't allow him to wrestle because of a non-contagious skin condition known as granuloma annulare, even though he had a doctor's note clearing him to compete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I was devastated,\" Kelly said. \"I mean, I've had this mark my whole life. I never would have thought I'd be disqualified for it. ... I thought my season was over.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition has never caused an issue, either during Mount Carmel meets or outside the high-school season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It will get [more noticeable] during the [prep] season because I'm Irish and have fair skin,\" Kelly said. \"... But no, it's never been a problem.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the note was accepted five days after the regional when Kelly and the Caravan wrestled in the Marmion Dual-Team Sectional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-sports/2026/02/11/mount-carmel-ihsa-liam-kelly-wrestling\"   &gt;Judge rules against IHSA, says Mount Carmel wrestler Liam Kelly can resume state title defense&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the IHSA initially declined to return Kelly to the individual bracket, and his father Michael filed suit in Cook County Circuit Court seeking an emergency temporary restraining order. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-sports/2026/02/11/mount-carmel-ihsa-liam-kelly-wrestling\"   &gt;Judge Alison Conlon granted the TRO on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; and the IHSA accepted the ruling, adding Kelly as a 13th wrestler to the 165-pound bracket at Hinsdale Central.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Kelly, Caravan coach Alex Tsirtsis is just glad to put the ordeal in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It was a nightmare at the regional just knowing that he's got a condition where he's been wrestling with it for the last four years and no trainers second-guessed the doctor's note or anything like that [before],\" Tsirtsis told the Sun-Times. \"... But we were able to get it right and it's just fun to see him compete.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly credits his support system at Mount Carmel for helping him weather the storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"All the guys at Mount Carmel — I'm so grateful that I have a coach and a community that helps me and fights for what's right,\" Kelly said. \"Because at any other school, there's no shot I'd be here.\"&lt;/p&gt;",
