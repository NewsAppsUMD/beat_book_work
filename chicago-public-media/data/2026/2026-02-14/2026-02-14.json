The Purdue-bound defensive lineman was also the focal point of the basketball team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had high expectations early in the year and when Max went down, it threw us completely off,” coach Don Houston said. “We had to learn how to play without him. He was a potential all-stater.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carmicle’s injury meant major minutes for 6-7 junior Terrence Richardson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Terrence was a 5-9, B-team player in his freshman year,” Houston said. “He just stretched out and then he had to learn how to play with his length.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richardson didn’t have the physical mindset for post play early in the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Terrence started out the season soft,” Hillcrest guard Jamir Ratliff said. “But he got a tougher mindset and got better from there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richardson scored seven points and grabbed 13 rebounds in the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/super-25-basketball-rankings/2026/02/08/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;No. 25 Hawks’ &lt;/a&gt;60-49 victory at Lemont on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/13/chicago-illinois-high-school-basketball-scores\"   &gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We put a lot of work into toughening him up,” Houston said. “He’s been doing a great job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The softness is gone now, and Richardson plays like a promising college prospect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been up and down and up and down this season,” Richardson said. “It’s been a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-5e0000\" name=\"image-5e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b454a5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F20%2F79fc734d440088c3e2124d452b4d%2Fob-cst-021426-7003.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/981ec81/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F20%2F79fc734d440088c3e2124d452b4d%2Fob-cst-021426-7003.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/843fec8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F20%2F79fc734d440088c3e2124d452b4d%2Fob-cst-021426-7003.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Hillcrest&amp;#x27;s Terrence Richardson (12) gets fouled but makes this shot in the first half of the Hawks&amp;#x27;

Ratliff scored 17 points against Lemont to crack the 1,000-point mark in his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hitting 1,000 feels good, but it was never really the goal,” Ratliff said. “It just happened naturally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophomore Ja’Sean Greene added 14 points for Hillcrest with some dynamic moves to the basket and senior point guard Jamari Thomas handled Lemont’s pressure with grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Greene] has been playing like that all season,” Houston said. “He gives us solid minutes and he’s probably our best defender. He’s only going to continue to get better. He will step up huge for us next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemont (15-12, 9-3) jumped out to a 19-9 lead and still led 29-28 at halftime but only scored one field goal in the first 12 minutes of the second half as Hillcrest took control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior Zane Schneider led Lemont with 22 points, and 6-5 senior Ryan Crane added 11 points and seven rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hillcrest joined the Super 25 on Sunday after knocking off Kenwood by 22 points last week. The Hawks’ only losses in 2026 are to York and Curie, and they played the Condors tough, losing by just two points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are playing to the competition level,” Houston said. “But overall, we are starting to find ourselves now. It is state or bust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hillcrest hosts a Class 3A sectional. The Hawks are the No. 2 seed behind Leo, and the path to Champaign looks very promising. The Illinois High School Association released the full state tournament playoff brackets on Friday evening. Crete-Monee and Thornton are the other contenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-b40000\" name=\"html-embed-module-b40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"No Shot Clock, Ep. 201: Conference quick takes\" allowtransparency=\"true\" height=\"150\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);height:150px;\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=5patj-1a40c88-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=auto&amp;logo_link=episode_page&amp;btn-skin=c73a3a\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Those keys unlocked what he called the best 1½-month offensive stretch of his life last season before a strained quad in late May broke his rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same things are focuses for Cubs center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong, especially disciplined swing decisions. That has dominated most of their hitting conversations so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I think the sky’s the limit for him,’’ Bregman said of Crow-Armstrong. ‘‘I feel like he can do anything on a baseball field: running the bases, defensively, offensively. And I feel like the more he refines his game, he’s just going to continue to get better and better.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman joined the Cubs with an already-glowing reputation for his &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/01/15/cubs-tout-alex-bregmans-leadership-as-they-enter-long-term-commitment\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;leadership skills&lt;/a&gt;. The examples keep stacking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman was in the coaches’ room earlier this week, president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer said, asking about what his teammates were working on and how he could reinforce those cues. During the offseason, young infielder Matt Shaw joined Bregman at his facility in Arizona to hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s rare to have a player that’s invested in helping make young guys better,’’ Hoyer said. ‘‘And you’ll see it in various ways, but it’s a wonderful quality that he has. It’s something people with the Astros talk about and people with the Red Sox talk about, and it’s something he’s earned.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman is expected to make an impact on the Cubs all season. But because of the World Baseball Classic schedule this spring, there’s one young position player he’ll be around more than any other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I’m really excited to spend some serious time with him,’’ Crow-Armstrong said of Bregman, who will join him on Team USA. ‘‘The guy is super-enthusiastic about the intricacies of the game. And I’ve loved hearing him share his experiences in the past. And I think he’s going to make me and the whole squad just a whole lot better.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman and Crow-Armstrong were early arrivals in camp. And though Bregman left the complex Thursday with an illness, he was back Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two have about two more weeks left with the Cubs before joining Team USA for WBC play. It will be Crow-Armstrong’s first WBC and Bregman’s second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Bregman was the youngest player on Team USA’s squad, turning 23 about a week after the team beat Puerto Rico in the final. The next time around, in 2023, Bregman couldn’t participate after breaking a finger in the World Series several months before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I didn’t get to play that much [in 2017], but I got to experience it,’’ Bregman said. ‘‘And I’ve been looking forward to this since then.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman can pass lessons from that early experience to the 23-year-old Crow-Armstrong, but the two will have more time for general baseball conversations, too. Pitch selection is sure to continue to be a topic between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman’s elite chase rate put him in the 95th percentile in that category last season. Crow-Armstrong, meanwhile, is well aware that he’s a free swinger and that improving his command of the strike zone is an avenue to take his offensive game to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s not the first time Pete’s talked about pitch selection,’’ Cubs manager Craig Counsell said of Crow-Armstrong’s conversations with Bregman. ‘‘But, kind of like pitch grips, how it clicks for you and how you see it and how it resonates and how you process it, it’s different for everybody.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more conversations Crow-Armstrong has with coaches or teammates who excel in that area, the more chances he will create to have that ‘‘aha’’ moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘The way Alex approaches it, he’s been successful, and it’s been successful for other players, as well,’’ Counsell said. ‘‘So of course we’re all going to listen to that.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\"

The amount parents take out in loans is sometimes more than their annual earnings, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fear is really that they're just putting these families into real financial trouble, real financial jeopardy,” Burd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report focuses on federal Parent PLUS loans, which parents can use to pay for tuition costs that can’t be covered out of pocket or through scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most federal student loans have limits, families can take out Parent PLUS loans up to the total cost of attendance. But Parent PLUS loans, which have a high fixed interest rate and origination fees, weren’t designed for low-income families, Burd said. They were meant to help middle- and upper-income families send their children to more prestigious and expensive schools, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were never intended as a way for schools to be able to help low-income students,” Burd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePaul officials say the university provides scholarships and grants and offers information about various loans but ultimately families decide what to borrow. A Loyola University spokesperson said the university \"works proactively with students and families to present all available options,\" without steering families toward any particular option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Loyola will continue strengthening resources that help families manage educational costs and minimize debt,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Parent PLUS loans, the schools are not held accountable if the borrowers go into default, and the Trump administration is expected to soon start garnishing wages from people who have defaulted on student loans after a pause on payments that started during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools can offer students merit-based scholarships based on grades and academic success, even if they don’t qualify for need-based aid. And those scholarships can end up taking up a large share of a school’s financial aid funds, leaving low-income students in need of loans — and that’s where the Parent PLUS loans come in, Burd says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem compounds, Burd says, when schools offer better financial aid packages to students whose families make more, a strategy he says is often aimed at attracting high-achieving and wealthy students who could give generous donations in the future. That incentivizes colleges to recruit students with an eye for “raising revenue for your institution and rising up the rankings,” Burd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some schools have used this practice to improve their spot in national rankings and transform themselves from a humble commuter school to a nationally competitive university, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find schools that appeared to be steering lower-income families toward Parent PLUS loans, Burd looked for colleges where a large share of students who received federal Pell Grants, which are meant for low-income students, had parents taking out Parent PLUS loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At DePaul University, 53% of students whose parents took out Parent PLUS loans were Pell Grant recipients and their parents borrowed on average $33,000 in PLUS loans, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Loyola, 48% of students whose parents have Parent PLUS loans had Pell grants. The average Parent PLUS debt taken on by those Loyola parents was around $46,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-3f0000\" name=\"image-3f0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/32606e3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/05f5575/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c844ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Loyola University Chicago campus\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c844ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d797611/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c844ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Loyola University Chicago, 48% of students whose parents have Parent PLUS loans received Pell grants for lower-income students.

The spokesperson said DePaul provides students over $350 million a year in academic scholarships and need-based grants using institutional funds and philanthropic gifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DePaul offers information to students and families regarding various loan options, and ultimately families make the decision to proceed with loans as they see fit,” the spokesperson wrote in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 41 private and public colleges and universities cited in the report collectively spent $2.4 billion of their financial aid dollars on students who didn’t need the help in 2023, the most recent data available. Nearly $2 out of every $5 spent on financial aid went to students who the federal government considers able to afford college without additional aid, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burd started with a list of more than 300 selective colleges and universities with a certain size endowment, excluding historically Black colleges and universities because he said they have been historically underfunded and have far less financial aid to give. Art schools were also excluded because they are among the most expensive schools, partly because of costly supplies and tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burd then looked for schools at which families of Pell Grant recipients made up at least one-third of PLUS loan borrowers and the median amount of loans was at least $15,000. At the 41 schools cited in the report, 45% of the borrowers were the parents of Pell recipients, and they borrowed a median amount of $29,102.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some lawmakers have noted this trend and have capped Parent PLUS loans at $65,000 per child, but Burd says that’s still too much for many families to borrow. He said ideally, legislation will be implemented to stop schools from steering families toward taking out loans they can’t afford to repay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only other worry, though, is that private lenders are going to come in and start offering even more predatory products,” he said. “So that's something we need to look out for as well.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

I just feel blessed to be out here.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's top-ranked Class 3A 165-pounder according to Illinois Matmen, Kelly won three technical falls in less than six minutes of mat time to move closer to another trip downstate. He can punch his ticket Saturday for the 3A state finals, which run next Thursday through Saturday at State Farm Center in Champaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His path seemed blocked on Jan. 31 when officials at the Morton Regional wouldn't allow him to wrestle because of a non-contagious skin condition known as granuloma annulare, even though he had a doctor's note clearing him to compete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I was devastated,\" Kelly said. \"I mean, I've had this mark my whole life. I never would have thought I'd be disqualified for it. ... I thought my season was over.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition has never caused an issue, either during Mount Carmel meets or outside the high-school season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It will get [more noticeable] during the [prep] season because I'm Irish and have fair skin,\" Kelly said. \"... But no, it's never been a problem.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the note was accepted five days after the regional when Kelly and the Caravan wrestled in the Marmion Dual-Team Sectional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-sports/2026/02/11/mount-carmel-ihsa-liam-kelly-wrestling\"   &gt;Judge rules against IHSA, says Mount Carmel wrestler Liam Kelly can resume state title defense&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But the IHSA initially declined to return Kelly to the individual bracket, and his father Michael filed suit in Cook County Circuit Court seeking an emergency temporary restraining order. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-sports/2026/02/11/mount-carmel-ihsa-liam-kelly-wrestling\"   &gt;Judge Alison Conlon granted the TRO on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; and the IHSA accepted the ruling, adding Kelly as a 13th wrestler to the 165-pound bracket at Hinsdale Central.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Kelly, Caravan coach Alex Tsirtsis is just glad to put the ordeal in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It was a nightmare at the regional just knowing that he's got a condition where he's been wrestling with it for the last four years and no trainers second-guessed the doctor's note or anything like that [before],\" Tsirtsis told the Sun-Times. \"...

JB Pritzker is preparing to give his annual budget address. It’s an unenviable task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget released a report showing federal tax cuts caused a $587 million reduction in state revenues this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor announced last month that he was withholding $482 million in state spending to help mitigate federal attacks on the state budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not all horrible news. The latest monthly revenue report from the Legislature’s Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability showed January revenues from state sources were up, according to the commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-b00000\" name=\"module-b00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnists bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Columnists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;In-depth political coverage, sports analysis, entertainment reviews and cultural commentary.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personal income tax receipts increased 2.1% in January compared to the previous January (which is still below inflation). Corporate income tax revenues rose by 3.5% after months of lagging. Gross sales tax revenues increased by 3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estate tax receipts are up 60%, or about $200 million, so far this fiscal year compared to last year at this time, the commission reported. The commission said asset valuation increases, including the stock market, likely contributed to the increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far this fiscal year, revenues are up a bit more than $1 billion, or 3.5%, compared to the same period in fiscal year 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is that big federal downside. According to the Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability's report, federal revenues experienced a “notable decline,” falling $169 million, or almost 36% in January, compared to the same month last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the fiscal year to date, federal sources have dropped by about 8%. But January marked the third straight month for federal revenue declines, so it may be accelerating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To meet initial fiscal year estimates, Federal Sources will need to show meaningful improvement over the remaining five months,” the monthly report declared. The fiscal year ends June 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What else will White House cut? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;And nobody knows what tomorrow may bring. Heck, by the time you read this, something new could’ve happened. At any given moment, White House operatives could try to pull funding for whatever program they can dream up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Trump administration announced that it was canceling $100 million for local public health grants in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois was one of just four Democratic-led states that were targeted for the cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, some of the cuts were for “HIV Prevention and Surveillance, which includes programs to expand HIV testing to cover more people who may not be aware they have HIV; linking newly-diagnosed patients to appropriate care; expanding access to PrEP, medication which can reduce the spread of HIV; and conducting partner notification.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Kwame Raoul quickly won a temporary restraining order last week, giving the state a 14-day reprieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raoul has so far fought off numerous federal attempts to withhold money from the state. But there’s just no way of knowing what could happen as the litigation moves up the federal judicial food chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, there is just no way to craft a reliable fiscal plan in this environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My associate Isabel Miller wrote a subscribers-only story last week for my newsletter about how more than 40 Democratic members of the Illinois House and Senate have been meeting weekly to come up with a plan to find some government efficiencies and create new revenue streams to help the state meet its obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We must lean into transforming our tax system and creating sustainable revenue to protect people and the services we all depend on,” the Affordability and Tax Justice Coalition declared in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was told that six ideas are under discussion, and four have been introduced into bill form: A digital advertising tax — &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus?DocNum=3353&amp;amp;GAID=18&amp;amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;amp;LegId=166224&amp;amp;SessionID=114\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Senate Bill 3353&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus?DocNum=4894&amp;amp;GAID=18&amp;amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;amp;LegId=166185&amp;amp;SessionID=114\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;House Bill 4894&lt;/a&gt;); A billionaire wealth tax (&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus?DocNum=3376&amp;amp;GAID=18&amp;amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;amp;LegId=166257&amp;amp;SessionID=114\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Senate Bill 3376&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus?DocNum=5215&amp;amp;GAID=18&amp;amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;amp;LegId=166888&amp;amp;SessionID=114\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;House Bill 5215&lt;/a&gt;); Expanded tax haven reporting (&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus?DocNum=5318&amp;amp;GAID=18&amp;amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;amp;LegId=167073&amp;amp;SessionID=114\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;House Bill 5318&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus?DocNum=3486&amp;amp;GAID=18&amp;amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;amp;LegId=166487&amp;amp;SessionID=114\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Senate Bill 3486&lt;/a&gt;) and closing corporate loopholes (&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus?DocNum=3796&amp;amp;GAID=18&amp;amp;DocTypeID=SB&amp;amp;LegId=167119&amp;amp;SessionID=114\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Senate Bill 3796&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus?DocNum=5125&amp;amp;GAID=18&amp;amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;amp;LegId=166713&amp;amp;SessionID=114\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;House Bill 5125&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Isabel noted, House Speaker Emanuel \"Chris\" Welch has also been promoting a tax on millionaires, which has heartened the progressives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Graciela Guzmán, D-Chicago, sits on the coalition’s executive committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think right now the growing sentiment is ‘Let’s get as much revenue as possible,’\" Guzmán told Isabel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guzmán also said the coalition is pressing revenue advocates for specifics, including projected revenues for each proposal, constitutionality and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too often, these groups just throw together proposals and hope for the best. But Guzmán said they’re focusing on whether these ideas can pass both chambers and be signed into law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The roll call is something that we keep talking about every week because we know the votes that we have to get up to in any one of these proposals,\" Guzmán told Isabel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot is riding on those efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rich Miller also publishes Capitol Fax, a daily political newsletter, and CapitolFax.com.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-620000\" name=\"module-620000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

Last year, A&amp;amp;W continued expanding into general contracting, including carpentry, flooring and joint sealant, while still offering respiratory health services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is continuing work on projects at O’Hare Airport, McCormick Place, the Chicago Transit Authority’s Red Line extension to 130th Street and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is uncertainty in the infrastructure construction industry surrounding new federal diversity guidelines issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, the Department of Transportation changed the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program by removing race or gender as indicators of social or economic disadvantage. It previously required federally-funded construction projects to award a certain percentage of contracts to smaller firms certified as DBEs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department defined DBEs as for-profit small businesses in which socially and economically disadvantaged people own at least a 51% interest and control management and daily business operations. African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian-Pacific and Subcontinent Asian Americans and women and other groups fell into that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A&amp;amp;W benefited from the CTA’s goal of awarding 20% of contracts for its $2.1 billion modernization of the Red and Purple lines to DBEs. In 2024, Mobley’s company was &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2024/03/09/cta-dbe-program-small-business-construction-red-purple-modernization\"   &gt;one of 119 minority- or female-owned businesses&lt;/a&gt; working on the project, according to the CTA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, DBEs must undergo recertification, which includes providing personal narratives along with financial documentation to prove disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobley said the recertification process was more open-ended, qualitative and time-consuming. Her five-page application included answers explaining her upbringing, education, parents’ background and financial situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You tell your story and hope the person who reads it thinks you’re disadvantaged,” she said. Mobley submitted her application last year expecting to be recertified. Last month, the city of Chicago notified her that A&amp;amp;W will be re-certified as a DBE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-830000\" name=\"module-830000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;A&amp;amp;W Contractors&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;About:&lt;/b&gt; Provides construction and contracting services&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Neighborhood:&lt;/b&gt; Englewood&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Owners:&lt;/b&gt; Adrian Mobley&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Founded:&lt;/b&gt; 2014&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Staff size:&lt;/b&gt; 20-30&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Estimated annual revenue:&lt;/b&gt; $5 million&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recertification is “absolutely imperative” for A&amp;amp;W, Mobley said. At least 40% of the company’s contracts are for federally-funded projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A&amp;amp;W didn’t lose any existing contracts last year. However, some federally-funded projects were delayed, such as the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2025/10/03/donald-trump-pause-funding-chicago-infrastructure-projects-red-line-extension\"   &gt;CTA’s Red Line Expansion&lt;/a&gt;. A&amp;amp;W is still doing demolition and temporary fencing for the Red Line project, which has started but is not in full swing, Mobley said. And the Red and Purple Modernization project wrapped up last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s 2025 revenue was about $5 million, less than Mobley’s target of $8 million. A&amp;amp;W currently has 20 to 30 project-based employees, which is below last year’s goal of reaching 75 workers. But the company is much bigger than in 2020 when it had three employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of an expansion, Mobley is scouting for a larger potential headquarters. She’s considering locations all over Chicago and might leave Englewood, though she would prefer to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, she expects to hire more construction staff, such as laborers and carpenters, as well as continuing to search for administrative staff and a project manager. One challenge for A&amp;amp;W is integrating new technology and administrative software as it grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobley’s 2026 goals are an extension of last year’s targets, and she’s optimistic about the prospect of future projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m excited about all the new possibilities,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListA\" data-module\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\"

He is in his 60s, and although he's 50% disabled, he can still work custodial jobs. His sister, \"Gayle,\" who lives 500 miles away, asked him to move in with her and her husband, saying they would help take care of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louis moved, not realizing his sister was a severe alcoholic. She'd come home from work, have six or eight drinks and become really belligerent with both her husband and Louis. She even gave Louis 30 days to get out of her house. He has nowhere to go because he severed ties with everyone in his prior location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I loaned Louis enough money to keep him from starving as he tried to find a means of support. He has applied for several custodial jobs. His brother-in-law is a great person but is not strong enough to do anything. Gayle has hit her husband on several occasions. They are at their wits' end and need advice. Gayle refuses to seek any kind of help. — &lt;i&gt;THERE FOR MY FRIEND IN FLORIDA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR 'THERE':&lt;/b&gt; Louis and his brother-in-law might find some support if they start attending Al-Anon or Smart Recovery meetings. Because they are dealing with a raging alcoholic, it may make them feel less isolated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to what you should advise Louis about his living situation: Since he burned his bridges in the town from which he relocated and doesn't have the funds to move out of his sister's home, all you can do is continue to listen to him and be as supportive as you can until he finds work. Because Louis is partially disabled, he may qualify for some services and assistance in his new community. Encourage him to look into these potential options further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My sister-in-law and mother-in-law are going to court against each other. My mother-in-law acknowledges that she wasn't a good mother when her children were younger. My sister-in-law claims her mother was harassing her by dropping off gifts, notes and money on birthdays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, my fiance and I were dragged into the middle of the situation because we were speaking with both of them prior to the court proceeding. Now, they have both cut us off! I'm pretty sure it was because we wouldn't pick sides, but why should we have to? We love them both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My fiance had a close relationship with his sister and mother. I know this is hurting him. How can I help bring their relationships back together? My sister-in-law has blocked me from all of her accounts, and if I mail a letter, I'm afraid she will accuse me of harassing her, too. — &lt;i&gt;TOUGH POSITION IN PENNSYLVANIA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR TOUGH POSITION:&lt;/b&gt; There is no way you can force a reconciliation between two parties who don't want to mend fences. You do not know whether your mother-in-law's motive for dropping off unwanted gifts was to harass her daughter. (It may have been.) My advice is to stay firmly out of the line of fire until after that court case has been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR READERS:&lt;/b&gt; On this day that celebrates love, I want you to know how much I value my long relationship with all of you. Wishing you all a Happy Valentine's Day. — &lt;i&gt;WITH LOVE, ABBY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

The company also said The Fulton is the only new Class A office building to break ground, which real estate research firms have also said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As soon as the new year hit, it was crazy,” Najem said of interest in the building. “There’s no space left in this market.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research from Transwestern shows that Fulton Market is the most sought-after area for office space. The vacancy rate in Fulton Market/Near West Side is only 10.9%, the lowest of any submarket based on Transwestern's data. It’s also well below Chicago’s average office vacancy rate of 22.6%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vacancy rate in East Loop, by comparison, was 28.7% during the last quarter of 2025. In River North, it was 25%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fulton brings much-needed office space to Fulton Market. The 11-story building spans 535,000 square feet, making it one of the neighborhood’s largest  office buildings, according to Fulton Street Cos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fulton Street developed the building with Shanna Collective, a real estate and design firm founded by Shanna Khan. Khan’s father, Shahid, owns the Jacksonville Jaguars. Morris Adjmi Architects and FitzGerald designed the project, alongside Shanna Collective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fulton Market is such a vibrant neighborhood. The energy is absolutely electric, and I am so proud that we have been embraced by this thriving community,” Khan said in a news release. “Chicago’s legacy of resilience provided a spark of inspiration in the greater calling to go all in on The Fulton. … I am betting on a bright future for Fulton Market.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site of the new construction was previously vacant land, Najem said, falling in the historic Fulton-Randolph Market district. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developers negotiated with the city to build up to 180 feet tall, as long as the initial height of the new building matched the existing Schwinn building at 212 N. Peoria St., according to Najem. That resulted in a building that’s about 90 feet at the street and rises as it steps back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new office building features floor-to-ceiling windows, private outdoor terraces and a rooftop bar. The top floor is a hospitality-style amenity suite that includes a conference center, 4,000-square-foot fitness center, tenant lounge and outdoor terrace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think a big reason why tenants are moving here is because of the amenities that we offer,” Najem said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tenants — like the building’s anchor, Harrison Street Asset Management — originally planned to build out more amenities within their offices, Najem said. But when they saw the offerings at The Fulton, they pulled back on some planned amenities and were able to cut costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-820000\" name=\"image-820000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d1c4ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+295/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fd2%2F24914fad4590954cf4e244156913%2Ffulton-260213-25.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1665bcb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+295/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fd2%2F24914fad4590954cf4e244156913%2Ffulton-260213-25.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/14ff446/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+295/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fd2%2F24914fad4590954cf4e244156913%2Ffulton-260213-25.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A lounge area at the offices of Harrison Street Asset Management at The Fulton.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/14ff446/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+295/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fd2%2F24914fad4590954cf4e244156913%2Ffulton-260213-25.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/09f0164/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+295/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fd2%2F24914fad4590954cf4e244156913%2Ffulton-260213-25.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/14ff446/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+295/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2Fd2%2F24914fad4590954cf4e244156913%2Ffulton-260213-25.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lounge area at the offices of Harrison Street Asset Management at The Fulton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harrison Street and others have still made big swings to lure talent to the office.

Financial firm&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Permanent Capital’s previous office in Fulton Market was 500 square feet. They’re now taking up 10,000 square feet at The Fulton. BlackEdge Capital, another financial firm, is growing from about 9,000 square feet to 15,000 square feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been a growth story,” Najem said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Schwinn building is still being converted from apartments into office, a rarity compared to the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/04/25/office-residential-conversions-apartments-housing-downtown\"   &gt;growing residential conversion trend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once complete later this year, Coca-Cola will take over the top two floors. There are three floors in the middle of the building that are still available. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ground floor will become nearly 14,000 square feet of retail space, while the other retail area of the property is leased by Equinox and Gibsons Bar and Steakhouse.&lt;/p&gt;",

And right now, too many riders simply don’t trust the CTA to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the daily reality: long waits, ghost buses, inconsistent train service, and safety and cleanliness issues that never quite feel addressed. People no longer plan around schedules — they plan around uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just inconvenient. It’s expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliable transit is one of the most effective affordability tools a city has. When it works, families can avoid the high fixed costs of car ownership — loans, insurance, gas, parking and maintenance. When it doesn’t, people are forced into those costs whether they can afford them or not. Unreliable transit functions as a quiet tax on working families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my work around the city, this issue comes up more than almost anything else. The same simple frustration: “I just can’t rely on it anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a problem is consistent citywide, something fundamental is broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see this firsthand as a rider. The operators are almost always excellent, but too often the system around them falls short, and those moments are what make people quietly decide not to ride again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The usual response is familiar: more funding, a new plan, new leadership. Those may be necessary. But they won’t be sufficient. The Chicago Transit Authority’s core problem isn’t money — it’s credibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transit should be run with one overriding goal: reliability. That means honest schedules that match staffing reality, fewer missed runs and service riders can actually plan around. Honest service beats fictional service every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buses offer the fastest path to improvement. They already carry nearly half of CTA riders, especially on the South and West sides, yet they’re slowed by traffic we’ve chosen not to manage. Dedicated lanes and signal priority can deliver results quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safety and cleanliness must also be treated as core service standards. Riders don’t need slogans — they need visible presence and a sense that someone is in charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicagoans will invest in transit. What they won’t do anymore is write blank checks for a system they can’t trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliable transit isn’t a luxury. It’s essential to affordability and a city that works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Liam Stanton, founder, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicagostyleproject.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;The Chicago Style Project&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-720000\" name=\"module-720000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give us your take&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Send letters to the editor to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

But in addition to the Trump administration’s threats, the most serious threats we face are those of powerful corporate interests — in particular the fossil fuel industry — which is urging Congress to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.michigan.gov/ag/news/press-releases/2026/01/23/attorney-general-nessel-files-lawsuit-against-fossil-fuel-defendants\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;take away our right to hold fossil fuel companies accountable&lt;/a&gt; in Illinois when they violate the law. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our members of Congress must stand firm and reject these dangerous proposals to give legal immunity to entire industries causing harm in our state and city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am proud that the city of Chicago has taken &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/environment/2024/04/11/bp-chevron-conocophillips-exxonmobil-shell-chicago-climate-lawsuit-federal-court\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;legal action&lt;/a&gt; to make &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.ucs.org/climate/accountability\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Big Oil companies pay&lt;/a&gt; for fueling detrimental heat waves, damaging storms and ruinous floods in our communities and deceiving the public about it for decades.  &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://climateintegrity.org/uploads/media/CCI-BigOilAccountabilityLawsuits.pdf#:~:text=Case%20Filed:%2006/24/2020%20Minnesota%20is%20suing%20three,failing%20to%20disclose%20their%20knowledge%20that%20fossil\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/climate/michigan-oil-companies-lawsuit-antitrust-affordability.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Michigan&lt;/a&gt; have also filed lawsuits against Big Oil, arguing that they have deceived us all about the detrimental impact of extracting and burning fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michigan is the first state to claim that Big Oil violated antitrust laws, putting renewable energy fuel resources out of business. Since oil and gas companies caused this mess, they should be the ones to pay for cleaning it up. But Republican attorneys general, backed by the Trump administration, have proposed giving those same companies a \"liability shield\" that would eliminate Chicago’s ability to have our day in court against these companies. This shield from immunity, which is the industry’s top priority for 2026, would also make null and void any \"climate superfund\" laws passed in Illinois this legislative session — and such a bill has been introduced to ensure that fossil fuel companies pay for the damages caused by their products. Let’s be clear: No industry should be above the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climate crisis is exacerbating the affordability crisis by driving up costs for taxpayers and local governments. We can’t let massive fossil fuel companies eliminate our ability to make them pay their fair share. When the next climate-fueled storm hits, who should be charged with cleaning it up — everyday Chicagoans or the oil companies that fueled the crisis in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s up to our leaders to protect our right to the courts and our ability to create laws that hold industries accountable. Tell Congress now: \"No immunity for Big Oil.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Laura C.

By studying this world via patient scientific inquiry, science has aided humanity's existence to such an extent that much of our economy, national defense and well-being and health are dependent on science. Yet, despite all of this progress, the Trump administration and Elon Musk have severely defunded scientific research and higher education. This will severely harm America's ability to adapt to looming threats. We will also lose our ability to compete globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I call on the Trump administration to restore and boost science funding to guarantee America's future as the world's only superpower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.unlv.edu/people/michael-pravica\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael Pravica&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, professor of physics, University of Nevada Las Vegas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Send love to caregivers &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 200 residents at my retirement home and another 100 workers and visitors circulating daily, human dramas are playing out here constantly. Many of the most moving cases are up on Floor 5 with the highest care level. Some are rehabbing convalescents, expecting to rejoin the material self-service world. Others, though, are merely marking time before heading out a side exit near my own first-floor room, on a gurney under a sheet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beforehand, only so much can be done to make everyone comfortable physically, let alone emotionally. Friends and family or no, there are, after all, many empty hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sad situation speaks loudly to one housekeeper who spends much of her shift on 5, fluffing pillows and swabbing floors. Boosting our morale isn't her affair. Her octogenarian parents' shaky medical condition back home is, and her sons in college, with husband and wife both starting to feel the long-term effects of physical jobs. And yet she steps up, befriending new residents to start, quickly detecting whatever their strengths have been. Then she basically says, \"See? This is what’s made you important!\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists apparently label such a personality an affirmer. Regardless, as all the token gifts she got last Christmas suggest, she's rejuvenated many a faltering spirit. She's done it for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there's a shining star like her in your orbit, reflect on that often. And even after Valentine's Day, float an affectionate note to show them this blessing isn't lost on you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tom Gregg, Niles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Penn pusher&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As our nation approaches its 250th anniversary, we should not only celebrate our freedoms — we should remember the faith that helped shape them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Penn founded Pennsylvania as a \"&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/8/The-Holy-Experiment-in-Pennsylvania\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Holy Experiment,”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a colony built on Christian principles of justice, peace and love of neighbor. Long before 1776, he wrote and spoke passionately for religious tolerance and freedom of conscience in England, even at great personal risk — facing threats of death. His vision of liberty of conscience, fair laws and respect for all was not only groundbreaking but laid the foundation for what would eventually become the U.S. Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1751, to mark 50 years of this experiment, the Pennsylvania Assembly commissioned John Pass and John Stow to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nps.gov/inde/learn/historyculture/stories-libertybell.htm#:~:text=Speaker%20of%20the%20Pennsylvania%20Assembly,one%20right%20here%20in%20Philadelphia.\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;cast a bell.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Inscribed with Leviticus 25:10 — \"Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land Unto All the Inhabitants Thereof\" — the bell celebrated the enduring principles of faith and freedom that Penn had established. This bell, later known as the Liberty Bell, stands as a symbol of liberty grounded in faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If liberty is to endure today, we need to take a second look at the faith of Penn — grounded in something greater than himself, grounded in true liberty. Penn loved God, loved his neighbor and lived out the freedom that flowed from it. It worked for him, and it can work for us today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rev.

It's about time the 55,000 residents of that village call out their police department for their lack of guts, communication, transparency and results. When is enough, enough?

And in the underwhelming world of Bulls executive vice president of basketball operations Arturas Karnisovas, he’ll take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karnisovas likely will be grounded from screen time for a few weeks, and some of his car privileges will have to be revoked. All the while, though, he’ll be doing his best to argue that a D+ grade is still passing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s not wrong. It is passing — barely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s how Karnisovas came out of the midterm exam that was the NBA trade deadline. He had a good concept gone wrong and, more important, one that came at least a season too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, it amounted to seven trades, a whole bunch of second-round picks and a two-month tryout for newly acquired guards Jaden Ivey, Rob Dillingham, Collin Sexton and Anfernee Simons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the big picture, it was Karnisovas finally spitting at ‘‘competitive integrity’’ and going the way of the soft tank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with the Bulls’ medical department being overly cautious with current injuries, Karnisovas left coach Billy Donovan with a frontcourt that has very little chance of outplaying bigger teams in the final 27 games of the season. That’s the plan for how to lose games and increase the Bulls’ lottery odds for a loaded 2026 draft class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s subtle compared to what the Jazz and Pacers have been doing, but it has been effective so far, with the Bulls going 0-4 since the roster purge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why the poor grade after Karnisovas moved a bunch of expiring contracts to collect draft assets and chase lottery luck? Because, like everything he does, it came too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A top priority for a front office is understanding the value of a draft class. The 2025 class was filled with impactful players, and Karnisovas ignored that, only for the Bulls to be embarrassed in a play-in game. As far as his chase for 2026 — another talented class — it came too late. As bad as the Bulls are playing, it will be tough for them to drop lower than No. 9 in the lottery odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they can, however, that would leave them with a 4.5% chance at the No. 1 pick, a 4.8% chance at the No. 2 pick, a 5.2% chance at the No. 3 pick and a 5.7% chance at the No. 4 pick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karnisovas should be thankful for the master class several organizations put on to raise the grading curve. Because, in reality, that D+ could have been a bit worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trade-deadline winners&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pacers and Clippers:&lt;/b&gt; In sending a package that included center Ivica Zubac to the Pacers, the Clippers got back talented guard Bennedict Mathurin and a fun lottery gamble. If the Pacers land the fifth through ninth pick in the lottery, then the Clippers get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, the Pacers are set to make a run in the Eastern Conference next season with a healthy Tyrese Haliburton, Andrew Nembhard, Aaron Nesmith and a one-two punch of Pascal Siakam and Zubac in the frontcourt. The Clippers get a chance to rebuild on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grades: A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cavaliers:&lt;/b&gt; James Harden with two rim runners and that defense behind him for&lt;br&gt;often-injured Darius Garland?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grade: A-&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jazz:&lt;/b&gt; The Jazz surprised everyone by accelerating their rebuild by acquiring power forward Jaren Jackson while keeping their first-round pick. They then thumbed their nose at the NBA by sitting Jackson and Lauri Markkanen in a winnable game, just to keep the lottery spot in a safe place. Sure, they were fined, but such textbook tanking should be applauded for its boldness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grade: A-&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Trade-deadline losers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kings:&lt;/b&gt; The Kings have been begging teams to take DeMar DeRozan, Zach LaVine or Domantas Sabonis off their hands.

In the past, it was Damian Lillard and Kevin Durant. More recently, it was Ja Morant and Giannis Antetokounmpo. What they ended up with instead is another invitation to the play-in tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grade: D-&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rockets:&lt;/b&gt; The Rockets have needed another guard since Fred VanVleet was lost for the season to injury and were in talks with the Bulls about Ayo Dosunmu or Coby White. They missed on both, as White went to the Hornets and Dosunmu to a Timberwolves team that might send the Rockets home for the summer in the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Grade: D-&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

How they didn’t repeat. How this generation’s best defense allowed another team to beat them in their quest to be further engraved in NFL history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Part of the Seahawks’ non-repeat, outside of losing Klint Kubiak as OC, might be the NFL not wanting the most joyless, all-chill-personality champions in this modern-day turn-up football history to have the final spotlight on them two Februarys in a row. Well, that was true until the team showed up to the parade and turnt all the way up. Which could end up being another NFL reason.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time next year, there will be no Winter Olympics for a Super Bowl to hand off its energy to. No Lindsey Vonn heroic Shakespearean tragedy to capture the nation’s attention. No Mike Tirico heroics calling the Olympics immediately after being in the booth live-calling the Super Bowl. No ‘‘Quad Gods’’ to be fascinated by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time next year, the Epstein files will still be being discussed and still be being&lt;br&gt;unredacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be no feel good buzz hanging over a Derrick Rose jersey retirement here in Chicago. Gary, Indiana — and Iowa — will be totally out of the conversation for the Bears’ stadium being there. There won’t be stories being written about what the Bears need to do the next season to get to where the Seahawks once were. Non-baseball geeks of Chicago will legitimately care about pitchers and catchers reporting to spring training for the Cubs . . . and the White Sox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be no deep-seated heartache surrounding decisions made by the Bulls’ new president of basketball ops and GM at the trading deadline. No gutting of the roster with no plan in sight. Yet the conversations about how the team didn’t get Giannis Antetokounmpo over the offseason will still exist. And exist. And persist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be interest and energy for the NBA All-Star showcase — no longer called a game. The three-team round-robin tournament with USA young vs. USA old vs. World for this year will have — even with so many players missing (dodging?) it this weekend — returned some passion and pride to what for years (since the 2020 game in Chicago and years prior to that) had become one of the worst sporting events on the annual American sports calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be no reposts from Donald Trump co-signing his true beliefs on Black un-evolution and white supremacy, only because he will be too busy waving at the crowd from his suite at Super Bowl LXI. But a first-year intern from Michelle Obama’s ‘‘team’’ will ‘‘accidentally’’ post a video of the president in full orangutan likeness without being photoshopped. Blame AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time next year, Robert Kraft and Bill Belichick will be voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be no Bad Bunny backlash coming from Turning Point USA or the White House because Jelly Roll or Snoop will be the forced entertainment to calm the resilience and resistance of the Kendrick Lamar/Bad Bunny back-to-back SB ‘‘non-white, un-American’’ halftime takeovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be much attention on NCAA women’s basketball and the final season of Unrivaled. The WNBA strike that held up the 2026 season will have made the owners give the players everything they asked for in their new CBA, with one catch: a non-compete clause by another league owned by WNBA players. And the pre-Super Bowl game in women’s college ball will be USC vs. USC. Dawn Staley’s unbeaten squad vs. JuJu Watkins. It will be all the everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will also be no former G League players in the NCAA. The Pistons won’t be involved in another squabble. (Not brawl.) And all of the talk surrounding the NBA will be about the year’s rookie class as the ‘‘greatest rookie class in the history of the game.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time next year, people will have unfortunately forgotten the names Breezy Johnson and Erin Jackson. With no Olympics, they won’t be as prominent and meaningful then as they are right now. But somehow Hunter Hess will have remained a part of the larger societal conversation. Also, Bank of America will not have aired a TV spot as powerful as its Aretha Franklin-driven ‘‘Something Big’’ spot during the week of and after the Super Bowl to bring the country together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, lord willing, there will not be a kidnapping of a national anchor’s mother at the forefront of the entire country’s concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time next year, the Bears’ current 25-1 odds — their shortest preseason Super Bowl odds since 2019 — will be 5-1 odds the day after SB LXI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the day after Valentine’s Day 2027, the Bears will be walking off the field at SoFi Stadium having suffered the same defeat the Patriots just did as the Ravens or Broncos hoist the Lombardi. Only for coach Ben Johnson to vow during a news conference in Halas Hall the following Monday that the next year, 2028, the Bears will not return home from Mercedes-Benz Stadium empty-handed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Jim Ioriatti split them with Phil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Ioriatti glanced at the circus props swirling around our circular table, laughed and said, “I don’t bet that [stuff].” He made one big bet, Seahawks -4½.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Ioriatti, the brothers’ nephew, heeded a co-worker’s tip and bet Patriots tailback TreVeyon Henderson scoring a TD, at +475.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The boys are back&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ioriatti boys were back in town, and I wouldn’t miss the shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the second consecutive year, they visited Vegas for the NFL’s title game and insisted upon returning to the South Point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gouging on the Strip gave the South Point — and its fee-free parking and party admission, plus reasonably priced concessions — their most-favored status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil called the South Point a tribute to 82-year-old owner Michael Gaughan, son of the late Vegas pillar Jackie Gaughan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Michael] has the right idea,” Phil said. “Make it affordable, and people will come.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(People avoiding the Strip might have contributed to a Super Bowl handle of just $133.8 million, the state’s lowest in 10 years.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the quartet golfed in Utah. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Revere Golf Club in Henderson, near the Green Valley Ranch (GVR) sportsbook and Phil’s vacation condo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s the Ioriatti who, long ago, bolted west, to Chino Hills in Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil (76), Paul (70) and Jim (68) all grew up in River Grove and attended Holy Cross High School, with their late brother John. Paul lives in St. Charles, Jim in Wayne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty-four-year-old Mike, John’s son, grew up in Villa Park and went to Willowbrook High School. When John died two years ago, Mike slipped into his pop’s spot for these adventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday and Tuesday, Jim/Mike defeated Paul/Phil. Mike and I mocked odds being announced over GVR speakers, saying “-140 for the sweep.” Phil, playing harness races, said, “No sweep!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Mike birdied the first two holes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From there, total domination,” Mike said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sweep happened,” Phil said. “Pretty much done after two holes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Nightmares&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim, the tallest of the crew, also stands out as the lone Packers supporter among an extended family of maybe 200. Of that number, Phil and Mike agreed, 199 are Bears fans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From his first memory, Jim went against his older brothers just to go against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He also liked Bart Starr,” Phil said. “That’s how he became a Packers fan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Jim continued a four-week-old diatribe about the Bears getting “so lucky” against the Packers; not just once but twice, within a four-week span, at Soldier Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Phil, Jim became convinced that NFL games are fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul laughed as he said, “I felt so bad for him. I said, ‘Take it easy, it’s just a game.’ He rang me at 2 a.m., saying, ‘Can you believe …’ He was SO down, you couldn’t kick him anymore. So depressed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a young age, Jim battled his older brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even for my food,” Jim said, “I had to fight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herding these guys, just for a photo, proved challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only time we were together growing up, it seems,” Phil joked, “was when Mom [Aida] yelled, ‘Come eat it!’ for meals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mr. Bojangles II&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At halftime, I noticed a diminutive guy in a dark Caleb Williams No. 18 Bears jersey, everything real-deal stitched. I applauded his sartorial taste. He left drinks at his table and joined ours, in a far corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lambus Dean, 77, hails from the South Side. He has been residing in Vegas for 27 years, making a living as a Sammy Davis Jr. impersonator, and he’d just returned from a gig in Palm Springs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I expected a lot from Caleb, and he delivered,” Lambus said. “I got them at +170 to make the playoffs, which was great. Then I thought we’d win it all. We should have been in this Super Bowl!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gets better. The Ioriatti Bros. are first cousins to Bill Serritella, who plays Frank Sinatra in the “Ocean’s Rat Pack” show, featuring Tony Ocean as Dean Martin. Serritella sang at Mike Ioriatti’s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Paul texted Ocean, who raved that Lambus Dean might be the finest Sammy Davis imitator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Baby, it’s been too long,” Lambus said. “The Bears won it all in 1985, and we will win Super Bowl LXI. You got that right!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No 100-1 payoff&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Super Bowl’s first quarter ended with the Seahawks ahead 6-0, Mike rang wife Nicole, in Villa Park, to learn they’d won a $20 pull-tab game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Two hundred dollars!” Mike howled. With numbers 0 to 9, the last digit of the sum of both scores decides each quarter’s winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My best bet was more than 7½ punts, courtesy of Long Island handicapper Tom Barton, which hit before halftime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For futures value, Barton favors the Giants, whose Westgate SuperBook title odds are 60-1; the Bears and Jaguars, 25-1 each.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late in the game, Maye took off on a dash that would cash Phil’s props, until a flag got tossed. Holding, New England. It negated the play, and Maye didn’t run again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil kept repeating the game’s poor quality. The Patriots’ lost fumble burned that same-game parlay. When it became 29-13 and stayed that way, Phil won $1,500 in a $100 squares contest for nailing a scoring change and the final score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Seahawks kicker Jason Myers booted his Super Bowl-record fifth field goal, we all trumpeted him for MVP. His 100-1 odds wowed everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Seahawks tailback Kenneth Walker III, with 161 total yards but no touchdowns, got it. My great Vegas pal, a kidney doctor we’ll call Dr. Tout, had such a Myers ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also had 300-1 on Pats kicker Andy Borregales. Dr. Tout had envisaged a tough, tight defensive battle in which one of the kickers might soar. I texted him, “Robbery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That night, Fox Sports Radio’s national overnight king, Ben Maller, agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The voters blew it,” Maller barked. “You’re MVP and an offensive player, and you didn’t score? That game was so bad, a kicker deserved to be MVP.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bears are back&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One year ago, I strolled out of the South Point at the tail end of a single-file line of Ioriattis; the three brothers, then nephew Mike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three Bears fans wore Chicago caps, jerseys and T-shirts. Someone yelled, “The Bears suck!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike responded, “We know!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the three Ioriattis wearing Bears gear heard no malice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They see us and yell, ‘Go Bears!’ It’s a legacy team that’s back in action, and the NFL likes that!” Phil said. “This time, they saved those chants for Packers fans.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Last week, he informed his parents that he was instructed to participate in &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/02/10/cps-mother-outraged-by-history-lesson-her-child-says-included-reenactment-of-slavery\"   &gt;a slavery reenactment as part of a Black History Month lesson&lt;/a&gt;. He and other students were told to physically pull and bind their \"enslaved\" classmates with tape as they would be \"shipped off in a cage.\" The family has complained to the teacher and the principal who both deny the third grader's account. Williams continues to stand by her son as she's witnessed his mental distress in the days since and is now seeking meaningful accountability from the school. Chicago Public Schools officials said in a statement that they do not support simulations or reenactments of slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How did you get the photo?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While technical aspects are vital to creating a compelling image, sometimes visual elements that reveal more about the story have to take precedent, especially when one of the sources is anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I met Williams and Vinson Sr. in their shared home on the North West Side. They did not want to have their son photographed, which was understandable given the sensitive nature of the story. Williams walked me through a relatively dark house to a backroom with concentrated window light. I took a few photos of Williams there and remarked how she chose the perfect location due to the lighting. Vinson Sr. was watching from the doorway and mentioned that there was an even brighter office on the second floor and offered to take me up. I made more portraits in the second location, which was well-lit but didn't offer any visual context that related directly to the story. While Williams wanted to keep her son's identity unknown, I wanted to try to involve him in the visual without compromising his anonymity — so I asked if they'd be willing to try a final composition in his room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The room was tight and the light was challenging. The only way I could situate them was against a hot afternoon window. I had to push my ISO to an exposure that offered details in the shadows, which in turn blew out my highlights. But the scene was much more dynamic than the first two environments and offered some visual elements that nodded to their son, like the stickers and bright yellow poster on the wall and his football, which I asked Williams to hold. I prioritized storytelling interest over technical perfection and I feel the risk paid off. But the beauty of photography is that it's subjective so who really knows. You be the judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Technical details:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-c99fb892-fdf8-11f0-8afa-b3d074ccce9f\" style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; box-sizing: border-box;

She became Kenwood's all-time leading scorer — boys or girls — this season, was a starter on last year's IHSA Class 4A state championship and is committed to UIC. But one goal had eluded her over her previous three years: a city championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks crossed that achievement off her list after Kenwood's 56-25 win in the CPS city championship over Butler at UIC's Credit Union 1 Arena. It's Kenwood's first city title after four consecutive runner-up finishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Our goal was to be champions,\" said Brooks, who scored 12 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of the game, Kenwood played with extra energy and never relented. Every Butler run was snuffed out immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter, Kenwood senior guard Valencia Miller got open on a corner three and let it rip. The shot missed off the side of the rim and went up in the air. While other players watched the ball in the air, Miller rushed toward the ball, grabbed her rebound and earned a trip to the free-throw line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e30000\" name=\"image-e30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/574bcfb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6326x3550+0+335/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2Ff5%2Fed433dca40b3b761ef3946a7816c%2Fkw-cst-021426-018.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/56feb56/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6326x3550+0+335/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2Ff5%2Fed433dca40b3b761ef3946a7816c%2Fkw-cst-021426-018.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c0a8d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6326x3550+0+335/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2Ff5%2Fed433dca40b3b761ef3946a7816c%2Fkw-cst-021426-018.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"kw-CST-021426-018.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c0a8d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6326x3550+0+335/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2Ff5%2Fed433dca40b3b761ef3946a7816c%2Fkw-cst-021426-018.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/71d8dfb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6326x3550+0+335/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2Ff5%2Fed433dca40b3b761ef3946a7816c%2Fkw-cst-021426-018.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c0a8d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6326x3550+0+335/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8f%2Ff5%2Fed433dca40b3b761ef3946a7816c%2Fkw-cst-021426-018.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenwood players pose for a photo with the championship trophy after winning the city championship game against Butler at UIC. | &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirsten Stickney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a sense of urgency throughout Kenwood's team the entire night. They were quick to lose balls, crashed the glass with verve and had no wasted motion offensively. They played with the poise and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They didn't come out to merely win a city championship; the Broncos came to strut and show their public-league dominance. Kenwood has never shot it well at Credit Union 1 Arena. The Broncos knew they would need to have a dominant defensive performance to win on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter, Butler's first point didn't come until there were 26.6 seconds left in the first quarter. Kenwood forced Butler into a 0-for-15 showing from the field that made it hard for the  Lynx to recover from. Coach Andre Lewis said it was team's finest defensive showing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We're trying to do it all together in one year,\" Lewis said. \"We've grown a lot since the beginning of the year. There [were] games that we didn't trust each other in, and that's natural because they're new. The willingness to sacrifice for one another, it comes over time. It comes as a result of what you do off the court as well as what you do on the court ...  learning to trust one another. You got to actually go through some things. You've got to fail.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior guard Darryelle Smith, who transferred from Fenwick, scored 15 points and grabbed eight rebounds. Miller scored 12 points and grabbed six rebounds. Sophomore guard Kerminicia Wellington scored 11 points and grabbed 10 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Broncos were relentless defensively, digging on every drive and forcing Butler into tough, off-balance shots at the rim. Butler shot 22.2% from the field for the entire game. Twice in the third quarter, Butler coach Xaver Walton had to call a timeout to avoid 10-second violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenwood was feisty, particularly senior guard Amillya Henigan, who recorded five steals and was disruptive at the point of attack. Kenwood's ball pressure forced Butler into 17 turnovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday's win was a culmination for a Broncos team that is playing their best basketball late in the season. The championship is a testament to the foundation laid by previous Broncos teams. The tradition of winning is passed down from player to player over the years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks, the lone returning starter from last year's state championship-winning team, learned from former Kenwood players Ariella Henigan, Diann Jackson and London Walker-George and is now teaching her Broncos teammates Kenwood's winning ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"[Brooks] is a dog, so it's just her bringing my dog out,\" Smith said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

But all five starters from that team graduated, and this season’s new group has been learning how to win varsity basketball games over the past four months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Broncos have built a tough, hard-nosed identity. That was the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everybody has been saying all these years that Kenwood is soft,” junior Cameron Mwachullah said. “We had to beat that narrative and show them Chicago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one watching that game in Young’s gym on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/14/chicago-illinois-high-school-basketball-scores\"   &gt;Saturday&lt;/a&gt; afternoon will ever say that Mwachullah is soft. The 5-11 guard had the most difficult assignment in the game: stop Marquis Clark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark, a Tennessee recruit, is the most talented player in the Public League and slowing him down was the only route to victory for the Broncos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mwachullah was up to the task. He fouled out midway through the third quarter but did his job to near perfection. Clark was frustrated and scored just 11 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark surged after that, but Kenwood held on to beat &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/super-25-basketball-rankings/2026/02/08/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;No. 18 Young&lt;/a&gt; 62-57 and advance to the Final Four of the Public League playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had to believe in myself,” Mwachullah said. “We prepared and did our scouting, so I knew what was coming. I made sure I stuck to what we had been working on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark made two three pointers, one free throw, and scored two transition baskets when Mwachullah was guarding him. He scored 17 points in the 12 minutes after Mwachullah fouled out to finish with 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Mwachullah] is our iron man,” Kenwood coach Mohammed Cookbey said. “The biggest part of our team is his defensive presence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Broncos (17-7) jumped out to a 16-6 lead and led by 14 points at halftime. Young (21-7) fought back and cut the lead to three points three times in the final two minutes, but that was as close as it got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Kenwood] got off to an early start and rhythm,” Dolphins coach Tyrone Slaughter said. “We had to close that gap and we did. They outplayed us, and they were more deserving to win ultimately. Sixteen missed free throws are going to be enough to lose a game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-3e0000\" name=\"image-3e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2fb5503/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6528x3664+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F82%2Fb1%2Fed365940497a837a5e5173a667bd%2Fob-cst-021526-015.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5364805/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6528x3664+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F82%2Fb1%2Fed365940497a837a5e5173a667bd%2Fob-cst-021526-015.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/deadc0b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6528x3664+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F82%2Fb1%2Fed365940497a837a5e5173a667bd%2Fob-cst-021526-015.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Young&amp;#x27;s Marquis Clark (3) delivers the ball to the basket against against Kenwood.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/deadc0b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6528x3664+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F82%2Fb1%2Fed365940497a837a5e5173a667bd%2Fob-cst-021526-015.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c982f4f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6528x3664+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F82%2Fb1%2Fed365940497a837a5e5173a667bd%2Fob-cst-021526-015.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/deadc0b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6528x3664+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F82%2Fb1%2Fed365940497a837a5e5173a667bd%2Fob-cst-021526-015.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young’s Marquis Clark (3) delivers the ball to the basket against against Kenwood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirsten Stickney/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior Osiris Bell led the Broncos with 17 points.

But we just have to be tough every game and keep up the aggression.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark has been playing with a face mask &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2026/01/08/whitney-young-basketball-lincoln-park\"   &gt;since he broke his nose against Lincoln Park on Jan. 8&lt;/a&gt;. He was hit in the face multiple times against Kenwood and was slow to get up from the floor a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He is a warrior,” Slaughter said. “He battled and tried to finish the game. Marquis gave an All-State caliber performance but just came up a little bit short.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophomore Colby Irvin stepped up and played key minutes at the end for Kenwood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He can make all the reads and all the right passes,” Cookbey said. “And he is not afraid of the moment. He’s an Irvin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenwood will face Curie in the Public League semifinals on Wednesday at UIC. The Broncos have played in the last three city title games.

Now it's just about being able to speak and communicate in English, and I'm getting used to it more and more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As spring progresses, the expectations will be greater for Murakami, 26, who averaged 33 home runs in eight seasons for the Yakult Swallows in Japan and will be asked to fortify a power-needy lineup while playing first base and not third, his natural position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in his first week with the Sox, Murakami shook off many of the nerves thanks to the entire organization and the help of translator Kenzo Yagi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Still working on English right now but lots of gestures, lot of short words, short terms, but the communication is there and we're happy to be teammates,” Murakami said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox have rolled out the red carpet for Murakami by installing bidets, and Murakami expressed his appreciation with drops of humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the bidet toilets, “basically what I did was told them how great the bidet is. It’s good for the environment too, right? Everybody uses too much toilet paper.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When his first name on his nameplate was spelled ‘Munetaki,’ “I thought it was a joke,” Murakami said. “No hard feelings to the organization. It was crazy funny.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Sox reliever Shingo Takatsu told Murakami that “Chicago is the best place,” and outside support has come from conversations with superstar Shohei Ohtani (“he texted me”) and Yoshinobu Yamamoto of the Dodgers and Shota Imanaga of the Cubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Just do your thing, that was the advice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hitting for power - Murakami’s forte - caught the attention of Colson Montgomery and manager Will Venable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s got the juice, and he is really smart,” Montgomery said. “He has really good understanding of his swing and his process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Venable: “He will be in the middle of the lineup and excited to have him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Murakami’s hard-hit balls caromed off the back of pitcher Mike Vasil during live batting practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami welcomes the challenges that await him. He will extend his stay with the Sox until Feb. 27, when he reports to Japan to play in the World Baseball Classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I get more at-bats, get into (exhibition) games more,” Murakami said. “It helps Team Japan and the White Sox, and this is what I really wanted to do - get used to the games and get the most at-bats.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra time in the States will enable Murakami to learn the nuances of playing first base - which will include possessing the necessary footwork to hold runners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"My main priority is doing the normal basic stuff - backhands, forehands - just getting all the balls so that I can make the basic plays,” Murakami said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami already has reciprocated some of the help his teammates have provided him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m teaching them Japanese every day. To be honest, everybody is coming with Japanese to me as well. The person who stands out is Chase (Meidroth). He’s coming with Mōhitotsu—it means one more. So we are getting there in communication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was somewhat fitting that Murakami said “tranquilo.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in, “don’t worry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"cf wS\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\" id=\"rte-ca897290-09fc-11f1-800e-152b31fb6257\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" class=\"amq\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px 16px; vertical-align: top; width: 44px; visibility: hidden;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" class=\"amr\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; width: 734.667px;\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;",

So once we get that going, we'll settle into that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of Colson Montgomery, who hit 21 home runs in the second half of his rookie season, and the addition of Munetaka Murakami, who averaged 33 home runs in eight seasons with the Yakult Swallows in Japan, have swayed Benintendi into believing he might help the team more by simply reaching base more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benintendi posted a .353 on-base percentage in his first five seasons with the Red Sox, but he his on-base mark hasn’t been above .307 in each of his last two seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Benny is a hitter, and I think that whether it's power, getting on base, contact, he can do it all,” Sox manager Will Venable said. “He's got a lot of different clubs in his bag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For him, it's going to be just being healthy and being out there. How that compliments the lineup with the rest of the guys, I think that can look a lot of different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benintendi said he took some weight off his 5-foot-10, 185-pound frame to alleviate stress on his left Achilles that nagged him since July and eventually led to him being placed on the injured list for the final week of the 2025 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right now, it feels 100 percent,” Benintendi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Right on time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s an annual tradition with the hype when position players arrive early. Infielder Lenyn Sosa was en route to Arizona after the birth of a child, and infielder/outfielder Luisangel Acuna also was expected to arrive in time for Sunday's first full squad workout after experiencing a delay in obtaining his visa from his native Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These guys are on their way and are excited to get here, we’re excited to have them,” Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;High school reunion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Sox acquired Tanner Murray, 26, as part of a four-player trade with the Rays, it sparked a reunion with 32-year-old left-hander Tyler Gilbert.

But right-hander Jameson Taillon has faith in manager Craig Counsell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would think Craig would find a way to make us really good at it,” he said. “I just trust he's on it. Our [coaching] staff is so good, we don't have to worry about it. They'll figure out something, who gets to challenge, how it's going to work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring training, in part, will be a testing ground for the Cubs. The way Counsell explained it, the Cubs will have a presentation for their players before Cactus League games begin next week. They’ll be given the freedom to experiment with the system before the team implements more structure with another meeting before the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Like most of these rule changes,” Counsell said this week, “as we get a couple weeks into the season, and we have the whole league's worth of games and things, we'll know exactly what we want to do and have it dialed in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a refresher: teams get two challenges per game (with the potential for more in extra innings) and retain successful challenges. Only a pitcher, catcher or hitter can initiate an ABS challenge, by tapping his head, and has to do so without delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports-media/2026/02/12/how-abs-challenge-system-will-affect-mlb-tv-broadcasts-chicago-cubs-white-sox-spring-training-schedules\"   &gt;How ABS challenge system will affect MLB TV broadcasts&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;MLB first tested the system in the minors before bringing it to select spring training ballparks last year. And the Cubs, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/02/20/cubs-win-first-challenge-using-new-automated-ball-strike-system\"   &gt;specifically pitcher Cody Poteet, were the first team to use a challenge in spring training.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hope the umpires get them all right,” Counsell said, pushing back on the notion that the Cubs could find a way to gain an edge with their ABS strategy. “That's what you hope every game. You hope every game they get every call right and there's none of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor strategy, however, could set teams back. Burning challenges early on in a game, for example, could hamper a team if they didn’t have any left for the biggest moment in a close contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not a concern in the spring. While the games still don’t count, the Cubs plan to instruct the players who had ABS experience in the minors to give the MLB veterans with little to no ABS experience a chance to use most of the team’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There's probably going to be a game where we burn it early because somebody's trying to test it, but that's what that's what it's for,” pitching coach Tommy Hottovy said. “But the good thing is, too, we're going to get more feedback after the game on what were strikes, what weren't and so we can kind of help coach some of that stuff up as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those veterans, the adjustment isn’t as simple as relying on a well-trained sense of the strike zone – something Cubs hitters like Seiya Suzuki, Ian Happ and Alex Bregman are well known for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Umpires’ strike zones tend to be shaped more like an oval, whereas the ABS zone is a strict rectangle. Though the ABS zone is tighter on the vertical axis, it has more room on the corners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We definitely might have more of those corners that get clipped,” Hottovy said. “That's something we might try to play around with and see if we can take advantage of some more of those type of pitches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Hottovy has talked with left-hander Shota Imanaga about his experience throwing rehab games last year in the minors, where ABS had already been implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He got a strike-three called on a fastball up and in on a righty,” Hottovy said. “The righty bailed, and it just barely clipped the strike zone, and he got a strike three. And he remembers that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABS will continue to be a topic of discussion this spring and early in the season as players, umpires and fans get used to the change. But ideally its implementation will follow the same pattern as other recent rule changes, like the pitch clock and shift limits, which quickly became not only normalized but widely seen as enhancements to the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Counsell: “We should give it some time to breathe.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
