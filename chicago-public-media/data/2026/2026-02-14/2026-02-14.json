The Purdue-bound defensive lineman was also the focal point of the basketball team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had high expectations early in the year and when Max went down, it threw us completely off,” coach Don Houston said. “We had to learn how to play without him. He was a potential all-stater.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carmicle’s injury meant major minutes for 6-7 junior Terrence Richardson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Terrence was a 5-9, B-team player in his freshman year,” Houston said. “He just stretched out and then he had to learn how to play with his length.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richardson didn’t have the physical mindset for post play early in the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Terrence started out the season soft,” Hillcrest guard Jamir Ratliff said. “But he got a tougher mindset and got better from there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richardson scored seven points and grabbed 13 rebounds in the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/super-25-basketball-rankings/2026/02/08/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;No. 25 Hawks’ &lt;/a&gt;60-49 victory at Lemont on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/13/chicago-illinois-high-school-basketball-scores\"   &gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We put a lot of work into toughening him up,” Houston said. “He’s been doing a great job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The softness is gone now, and Richardson plays like a promising college prospect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been up and down and up and down this season,” Richardson said. “It’s been a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-5e0000\" name=\"image-5e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b454a5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F20%2F79fc734d440088c3e2124d452b4d%2Fob-cst-021426-7003.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/981ec81/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F20%2F79fc734d440088c3e2124d452b4d%2Fob-cst-021426-7003.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/843fec8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F20%2F79fc734d440088c3e2124d452b4d%2Fob-cst-021426-7003.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Hillcrest&amp;#x27;s Terrence Richardson (12) gets fouled but makes this shot in the first half of the Hawks&amp;#x27;

Ratliff scored 17 points against Lemont to crack the 1,000-point mark in his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hitting 1,000 feels good, but it was never really the goal,” Ratliff said. “It just happened naturally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophomore Ja’Sean Greene added 14 points for Hillcrest with some dynamic moves to the basket and senior point guard Jamari Thomas handled Lemont’s pressure with grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Greene] has been playing like that all season,” Houston said. “He gives us solid minutes and he’s probably our best defender. He’s only going to continue to get better. He will step up huge for us next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemont (15-12, 9-3) jumped out to a 19-9 lead and still led 29-28 at halftime but only scored one field goal in the first 12 minutes of the second half as Hillcrest took control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior Zane Schneider led Lemont with 22 points, and 6-5 senior Ryan Crane added 11 points and seven rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hillcrest joined the Super 25 on Sunday after knocking off Kenwood by 22 points last week. The Hawks’ only losses in 2026 are to York and Curie, and they played the Condors tough, losing by just two points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are playing to the competition level,” Houston said. “But overall, we are starting to find ourselves now. It is state or bust.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hillcrest hosts a Class 3A sectional. The Hawks are the No. 2 seed behind Leo, and the path to Champaign looks very promising. The Illinois High School Association released the full state tournament playoff brackets on Friday evening. Crete-Monee and Thornton are the other contenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-b40000\" name=\"html-embed-module-b40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"No Shot Clock, Ep. 201: Conference quick takes\" allowtransparency=\"true\" height=\"150\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);height:150px;\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=5patj-1a40c88-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=auto&amp;logo_link=episode_page&amp;btn-skin=c73a3a\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Those keys unlocked what he called the best 1½-month offensive stretch of his life last season before a strained quad in late May broke his rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same things are focuses for Cubs center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong, especially disciplined swing decisions. That has dominated most of their hitting conversations so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I think the sky’s the limit for him,’’ Bregman said of Crow-Armstrong. ‘‘I feel like he can do anything on a baseball field: running the bases, defensively, offensively. And I feel like the more he refines his game, he’s just going to continue to get better and better.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman joined the Cubs with an already-glowing reputation for his &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/01/15/cubs-tout-alex-bregmans-leadership-as-they-enter-long-term-commitment\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;leadership skills&lt;/a&gt;. The examples keep stacking up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman was in the coaches’ room earlier this week, president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer said, asking about what his teammates were working on and how he could reinforce those cues. During the offseason, young infielder Matt Shaw joined Bregman at his facility in Arizona to hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s rare to have a player that’s invested in helping make young guys better,’’ Hoyer said. ‘‘And you’ll see it in various ways, but it’s a wonderful quality that he has. It’s something people with the Astros talk about and people with the Red Sox talk about, and it’s something he’s earned.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman is expected to make an impact on the Cubs all season. But because of the World Baseball Classic schedule this spring, there’s one young position player he’ll be around more than any other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I’m really excited to spend some serious time with him,’’ Crow-Armstrong said of Bregman, who will join him on Team USA. ‘‘The guy is super-enthusiastic about the intricacies of the game. And I’ve loved hearing him share his experiences in the past. And I think he’s going to make me and the whole squad just a whole lot better.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman and Crow-Armstrong were early arrivals in camp. And though Bregman left the complex Thursday with an illness, he was back Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two have about two more weeks left with the Cubs before joining Team USA for WBC play. It will be Crow-Armstrong’s first WBC and Bregman’s second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, Bregman was the youngest player on Team USA’s squad, turning 23 about a week after the team beat Puerto Rico in the final. The next time around, in 2023, Bregman couldn’t participate after breaking a finger in the World Series several months before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I didn’t get to play that much [in 2017], but I got to experience it,’’ Bregman said. ‘‘And I’ve been looking forward to this since then.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman can pass lessons from that early experience to the 23-year-old Crow-Armstrong, but the two will have more time for general baseball conversations, too. Pitch selection is sure to continue to be a topic between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman’s elite chase rate put him in the 95th percentile in that category last season. Crow-Armstrong, meanwhile, is well aware that he’s a free swinger and that improving his command of the strike zone is an avenue to take his offensive game to a new level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s not the first time Pete’s talked about pitch selection,’’ Cubs manager Craig Counsell said of Crow-Armstrong’s conversations with Bregman. ‘‘But, kind of like pitch grips, how it clicks for you and how you see it and how it resonates and how you process it, it’s different for everybody.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more conversations Crow-Armstrong has with coaches or teammates who excel in that area, the more chances he will create to have that ‘‘aha’’ moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘The way Alex approaches it, he’s been successful, and it’s been successful for other players, as well,’’ Counsell said. ‘‘So of course we’re all going to listen to that.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\"
