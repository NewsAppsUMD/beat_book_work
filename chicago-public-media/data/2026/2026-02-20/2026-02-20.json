Robin Kelly and Raja Krishnamoorthi as the only candidates &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/what-to-know-us-senate-primary-midterms-dick-durbin-seat\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;in a field of 10&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who met the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/Nexstar-Debate-Criteria-2026-1.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;network’s requirements to&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate opened with Stratton and Krishnamoorthi once again trading barbs over campaign funds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratton took shots at Krishnamoorthi for &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/12/08/raja-krishnamoorthi-senate-campaign-donors-trump-allies-maga-money\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;taking campaign contributions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from supporters of President Donald Trump, as well as an executive at a company contracted by ICE — a month after Stratton went on the offensive during an &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/01/26/senate-debate-sun-times-wbez-uchicago-krishnamoorthi-stratton-kelly\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;hourlong debate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hosted by the Chicago Sun-Times, WBEZ and UChicago’s Institute of Politics and International House&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnamoorthi shot back at Stratton for allowing the Democratic Lieutenant Governor’s Association to take money from CoreCivic, a private prison and ICE contractor, in 2024. He added that he had since donated the money he received to three immigrant groups, which he did not name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those are his values, he’s not going to be one to stand up to the people,” Stratton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnamoorthi shot back: \"I’m an immigrant, I don't need a lecture on standing up to ICE.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnamoorthi once again called to specifically abolish “Trump’s ICE\" as opposed to Stratton's wider call to abolish ICE. Kelly said U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem must be removed and federal agents “have to have rules like regular police officers do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/01/26/senate-debate-illinois-krishnamoorthi-stratton-kelly\"   &gt;Lt.

The war started Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas led an attack that took 251 hostages and killed nearly 1,200 Israelis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratton said she wanted to “see the suffering end” and wants Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down, but added that she believes Israel has a right to “safety and security.” When the moderators asked her a second time if what Israel is doing is genocide, she stumbled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnamoorthi said he wanted to see existing restrictions on foreign military funding enacted across the board as a means of reaching a two-state solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly noted she is a co-sponsor of the Block the Bombs Act, which would block the president from selling or exporting offensive weapons systems to Israel, and also called for Netanyahu to step down. She was the only candidate who would call Israel's actions genocide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There were a lot of things that happened before Oct. 7, also,” Kelly said. “It may not have started that way, but genocide was the result.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The candidates' remarks were posted online after the debate and can be found at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://wgntv.com/news/politics/wgn-democratic-senate-primary-debate-kelly-krishnamoorthi-stratton-02192026/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;WGNTV.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also running for the Democratic nomination are Steve Botsford Jr., Sean Brown, Awisi A.

They’re starting to feel each other out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unseld said that Giddey and Jones have started making comments on who they would like to be paired with, and that the two would be on a minutes restriction. These remaining 26 games are important in seeing who the Bulls want to keep around in the next phase of executive vice president of basketball operations &lt;b&gt;Artutras Karnisovas’&lt;/b&gt; plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Size disadvantage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls were already at a size disadvantage before the trade deadline, and they’re certainly facing an uphill battle after acquiring an abundance of guards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls aren’t going to get taller or stronger over the last portion of the season, leaving the coaching staff to get creative with their defensive coverages. They can start blitzing pick-and-rolls, picking up full court or having the roll man play more at the level of the screen rather than in a traditional drop coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to have to try and do different things, pressure, try to junk the game up at times, keep teams off balance,” Unseld said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls entered Thursday ranked 29th in opponents’ turnover percentage (12.3%). They haven’t been a very aggressive defense because of their lack of size and rim protection in the paint. With &lt;b&gt;Nick Richards&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Jalen Smith&lt;/b&gt; as their only nominal centers, the Bulls will have to be more of a pressing defense to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second-year forward &lt;b&gt;Matas Buzelis&lt;/b&gt; likely will take on more defensive responsibility. He has proven to be an imposing shot-blocker while serving as a weak-side defender. He has improved his reading of opposing offenses, which has allowed him to react quicker and use his long wingspan to rack up steals, deflections and be a rim deterrent for a team that desperately needs one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Buzelis has] done a better job of keeping those small, quicker, athletic wings and guards in front,” Unseld said. “We keep putting it on him, as far as increasing his workload, his retention to that side of the ball.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Home cooking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls began a seven-game homestand Thursday. The Bulls don’t play their next road game until March 5 in Phoenix. For such a new group trying to find its way together, this time at home could be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh, definitely,” Dillingham said. “Because we’re not on the road as much, [then] we all can be closer together. While we’re at home, [we can] get some wins and get some home-field advantage with the fans.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The number after DX corresponds to the density, with higher numbers allowing for larger buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Planning and Development’s zoning administrator said the proposed tower at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/07/14/west-town-developer-domus-30-story-residential-tower-fulton-market\"   &gt;215 N. Racine Ave.&lt;/a&gt; was “not appropriate,” making a rare recommendation against the project. The highest level of zoning approved in the project's area is DX-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Plan Commission voted in favor of the project, which will advance to the Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A DPD representative said during the meeting that the agency isn't necessarily opposed to the project. It recommended Domus purchase nearby land to expand the project’s boundaries, or reduce the building’s size and unit count to match the area’s density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domus is proposing a 29-story tower with 347 apartments, including 70 affordable units. It would have studios, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, the larger of which are a rarity for the area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There would also be ground floor commercial space, 88 parking spots and an amenity terrace with a pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project includes the purchase of land at 1240 W. Carroll Ave., which would be turned into a privately-managed public park, according to the development team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest requests from Fulton Market residents is green space, along with more family-sized units, Ald. Walter “Red” Burnett (27th) said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no green space whatsoever,” Burnett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of speakers, many from West Loop or Fulton Market, during the meeting's public comment period spoke in favor of the project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the West Central Association Chamber of Commerce wasn’t on board. The chamber’s executive director, Patti Doyle, said they were against the higher zoning designation and the precedent it sets for the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To be clear, the [chamber] supports more density. We want more family-oriented units and more affordable housing,” Doyle said. “Our position here is about process and precedent and ensuring that growth happens in a way that is consistent, predictable and aligned with long-term planning and growth for the Near West Side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DPD Commissioner Ciere Boatright voiced support for Domus' project and said she’s “hyperaware” of the city’s need for more mixed-income housing and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also acknowledged how projects of 215 N. Racine’s scale can create a slippery slope, because those larger projects don’t always get built. Other times, properties get sold after the city rezones them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financing for the $175 million project is in place, according to the development team. Boatright said the development agreement includes a clause stipulating the property’s zoning can be reversed if its ownership changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The building alone really fits into what Fulton Market is and where it’s going,” Burnett said. “We need this housing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Plan Commission also approved a 32-story residential tower at 1338 W.

Angela Clay’s (46th) office. Some neighbors weren’t on board with the building that they said is too dense for the area, while supporters argued that the neighborhood needs more housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on Thursday, speakers overwhelmingly supported the project and pointed to the rapid rise of Chicago rents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Plan Commission also gave approval to Sarah’s on Sunnyside, a building for the nonprofit Sarah’s Circle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located at 4432-4458 N. Clarendon Ave., the site will serve women facing homelessness, offering 54 supportive housing units for single women, staff office space and community space for residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efficiency units will be 480 square feet and will target homeless women earning 30% of the area median income.&lt;/p&gt;",

They ended a playoff drought that dated back to 2017 and won a postseason game for the first time since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge this season for Berhalter and the Fire is to reach another level and grow into a true Eastern Conference contender &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/fire/2025/10/21/after-eight-years-away-fire-finally-set-for-playoff-return\"   &gt;after finishing eighth in 2025,&lt;/a&gt; 13 points behind the first-place Philadelphia Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s turning into a good team like the Fire did last year or maturing into a really good one like they hope to in 2026, they know both steps are difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They might be equally hard,” said Fire attacker Philip Zinckernagel, a 2025 MLS All-Star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berhalter, Zinckernagel and the Fire open the season Saturday night in Houston against the Dynamo. Despite selling midfielder Brian Gutierrez in December to Mexican club Chivas de Guadalajara, the Fire arguably have a stronger roster than 2025. Through free agency, they added experienced midfielder Robin Lod while signing promising South African defender Mbekezeli Mbokazi and acquiring Swedish midfielder Anton Salétros from Stockholm-based AIK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re also in their second year under Berhalter, who understands the grind of an MLS schedule. He said the Fire’s focus is having a strong season to position themselves to win a championship, and not trying to win a trophy in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to be well-positioned as we go into the playoffs, to be able to win playoff series and keep moving,” Berhalter said. “It’s easier said than done, but what I’d say is the group understands the expectations. We’ve added quality to this group, we’ve added experience to this group, so we’re hoping to be better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being better than the 2025 Fire would mean shoring up the team defense. They gave up 60 goals last year, fourth-worst in the East. Because of those issues, the Fire only finished with a plus-8 goal differential despite scoring the second-most goals in the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More important than goal difference, the Fire could only clinch a playoff berth with two games to spare and were thrown into the Eastern Conference wild-card game. They beat Orlando City 3-1 in that home match but earned the right to face the Union and were dispatched in two games that highlighted the gulf between the Fire and an MLS power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zinckernagel wants to do better in 2026. He said the Fire have the high-quality players, potential and hunger to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ideally, we want to be qualifying for the playoffs much earlier, maybe competing for [the Supporters’] Shield, or be at the top of our conference,” Zinckernagel said. “It’s still a project that’s only been a year since Gregg came in and we’re building on our playing style and trying to get better every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least for the Fire, the questions around the 2026 team are different from most of the last 15 years. Instead of wondering about the future of the coach or whether the team is making progress, the subject is if they can build on legitimate success and rise to the level of a true MLS contender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zinckernagel said that isn’t adding any pressure to him and his teammates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The team is very motivated and hungry to get better and take [the] next steps. We made it to the playoffs last year, we won at home but we want to make it further,” Zinckernagel said. “We want to set the tone for this club to be up there as a team that can compete and be in the playoffs every season – not only being in the playoffs but also achieving something.”&lt;/p&gt;",

They were then cuffed and taken to a holding area to receive medical care. After that, the staff left the holding area to tend to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, “Duncan’s body slumped forward in the holding area and remained in that position until correctional staff and medical staff returned,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duncan was transported to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recently released findings, the medical examiner’s office listed the cause of Duncan’s death as cardiac arrest “during physical struggle with restraint.” Smoke inhalation, atherosclerosis and obesity were listed as secondary contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how long the fire was burning in the cell before Duncan and his cellmate were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duncan’s death was one of nine recorded at the jail last year, according to the sheriff’s office. Of the remaining eight, two deaths were ruled suicides, and two were determined to be from natural causes. The cause and manner of death of the other four are pending the completion of autopsies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew McLoughlin of the Illinois Network for Pretrial Justice said he wasn’t surprised to hear about the details of Duncan’s case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Deaths in Cook County Jail have been all too common over the last decade,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that many of them are a result of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.injusticewatch.org/project/jail-deaths/2024/cook-county-jail-deaths-2023/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;inadequate supervision and medical care&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are incredibly concerned that the Cook County sheriff's office has made clear that they are unable to keep people that are in their custody safe,” McLoughlin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A homicide ruling by the medical examiner indicates that another person caused Duncan’s death, but it does not imply that a criminal act took place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force is investigating Duncan’s death for any potential criminal behavior by staff, according to the sheriff’s office. The sheriff’s office custodial investigations unit and the sheriff’s office of professional review are also conducting their own investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But McLoughlin said he’s not confident that the investigations will deliver justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Speaking to the volume of instances where these deaths have happened, people have not been brought to justice, and there haven't been fundamental changes made over at the jail to prevent deaths like these,” McLoughlin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheriff’s office plans to pursue criminal charges against Duncan’s cellmate, who the spokesperson said has admitted to starting the fire.&lt;/p&gt;",

Dillingham was the 11th man, and guard Jaden Ivey did not play in the Bulls’ 110-101 loss against the Raptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dillingham is used to playing under a microscope. He was drafted No. 8 overall to an ascending Timberwolves team that made the Western Conference Finals during his rookie year. Every mistake was magnified given the championship aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s kind of the situation I’ve been going through since I got into the NBA,” said Dillingham, who played 10 minutes on Thursday. “I just try to figure out what’s the best way I can impact the game in whatever minutes I get.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, in Chicago, he was supposed to be removed from those lofty expectations. The Bulls were supposed to afford Dillingham a runway to explore his immense offensive talents. In the last game before the All-Star break, Dillingham played a season-high 30 minutes and scored 16 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dillingham and Ivey were the two promising players the team acquired at the deadline, so seeing them receive scarce or no playing time was weird. Acting coach Wes Unseld Jr. said Ivey’s DNP was a “basketball decision.” Ivey said he was healthy and practiced in full before Thursday’s game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was prepared to play,” Ivey said. “[The guards] were up in the air as far as who was going to play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outcome of games should be secondary for the Bulls at this juncture. The goal at the trade deadline was to escape the dreaded middle the franchise seemed destined for each year. But the coaching staff not prioritizing the two young guards they added shows a lack of foresight and isn’t instilling any confidence for a fan base growing restless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with the roster at full strength, Dillingham didn’t enter the game until the 2:18 mark of the first quarter. Ivey was relegated to the bench. Minimizing Ivey and Dillingham’s roles does no good for the Bulls going forward. Ivey will be a restricted free agent this summer, and the Bulls have to make a decision on Dillingham’s third-year option in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dillingham talked when he first came to Chicago about how he lost his confidence in Minnesota. He’s a dynamic offensive talent who can break his man down off the dribble. Dillingham showed both what makes him a tantalizing offensive player and so maddening with a key three-pointer and a subsequent turnover. It’s far too early to determine if Dillingham or Ivey is worth keeping beyond their current contracts, but playing them is the only way to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I like Josh’s game because he can do everything,” Dillingham said at shootaround. “He can guard one through five, shoot the ball, get to the rim and he can pass the ball. In college, I played off the ball a lot. Playing off the ball is easier for me to play in transition, get kicks. Playing with Josh is easy for me because I don’t really be needing the ball.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls are 1-10 over their last 11 after Thursday’s loss when they prioritized their veteran guards. Acquiring players such as Dillingham and Ivey and not playing them is another half-measure for Karnisovas and the organization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Back in November, his coaches and teammates knew it would take a while for Lee to get up to speed with all of the Rams’ defensive schemes and offensive sets. The senior had a lot of homework to catch up on. Lee has been faithfully putting that work in, and it started to pay off on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/19/chicago-illinois-high-school-basketball-scores\"   &gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in a packed gym in Gurnee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love to play in big games like this,” Lee said. “This is where I rise up the most. It’s been a lot of learning here, but my teammates trusted me and I trusted myself. I’m just doing whatever the coaches tell me. I’m feeling a lot more comfortable now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strong, mobile guard scored 12 points, grabbed 10 rebounds and sparked DePaul Prep to a 58-54 win against No. 5 Warren in a playoff atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The kid is fearless, which is something we love about him,” Rams guard Rykan Woo said. “He was amazing. We have been waiting for this. We know this is who he is and who he will continue to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren (28-3) was building some momentum early, and the large crowd started to make some noise. Lee shut it down with a three pointer at the end of the first quarter, and then the Rams took control of the game with a 12-0 burst midway through the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woo scored eight in the run and finished with 15 points. Rashaun Porter, a 6-7 senior, led the Rams (26-3) with 16 points and 10 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Lee] was awesome,” DePaul Prep coach Tom Kleinschmidt said. “We asked a lot of him and he’s coming along great. He’s a beast, physical, and he’s been making shots for us the last six or seven games. And he got us going when we were flat to start.

The junior was 1-for-8 from three-point range. The Blue Devils shot 5 of 24 from three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is not a whole lot you can do about Jaxson,” Woo said. “We did the best we could. We had to make it as hard as we could on him. The coaches did a great job preparing us and our scout team. They don’t get appreciated as much as they should. They played a huge role in this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePaul Prep led 54-42 after a three-point play from Porter with 1:56 left and some fans started to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Warren chipped away and cut the lead to 57-54 on two free throws by Davis with 8 seconds left. That was as close as it would get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With our size we try to make teams beat us on contested twos and take the three away,” Kleinschmidt said. “We wanted to show on Jaxson early. We did a nice job guarding. When they had 22 points at half I was really happy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Braylon Walker led Warren with 20 points and nine rebounds and senior forward Avonn King added 11 points and six rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the final game of the regular season for the Blue Devils. DePaul Prep hosts Ridgewood on Friday. Both teams are among a handful of top contenders for the Class 4A state title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a good game for us,” Blue Devils coach Zack Warren said. “We got better. We needed a tight physical game, we haven’t had many of them this year. We didn’t hit a lot of shots and the margin for error is really small against a team like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-200000\" name=\"html-embed-module-200000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"No Shot Clock, Ep. 202: Breaking down the 3A and 4A state championship contenders\" allowtransparency=\"true\" height=\"150\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);height:150px;\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=2i5vy-1a4a779-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=auto&amp;logo_link=episode_page&amp;btn-skin=c73a3a\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

We fell in love, got married and stayed together for seven years. Things changed; our divorce was amicable. We went on to successful professional lives and happy second marriages. We stayed in touch over the years, mostly through holiday cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I started getting emails from Bobbie about things and ideas we shared together. She lost her husband earlier this year, and I lost my wife about the same time. I stopped by to see her last summer during a visit with some other friends, and we had a nice visit over brunch. She looked good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would I be crazy to see if I could rekindle our relationship after 50 years? She lives a long way away now, but I've thought several times about moving back to the area where I grew up. It's clear we still share the ideals of our youth, and I'll admit I've always had a soft spot for her. I don't have much to offer these days, but I get kind of lonely. — &lt;i&gt;LOOKING BACK IN WYOMING&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR LOOKING BACK:&lt;/b&gt; I don't think it would be crazy at all to explore rekindling your relationship with her, but please take your time. If you want to move back to the area where you grew up, keep that issue separate from the romance. It would be unfortunate if you relocated, things didn't work out as you hoped, you had given up all of your social contacts and you had to start completely over solo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My son married my daughter's best friend, \"Kayla.\" I have loved this young lady since she was a little girl. When Kayla became part of the family, I was overjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kayla and my son now have had a baby, and I am not allowed to see the child. The only people who get to see the baby are Kayla's mother and her mother's family. Kayla's parents are divorced, so her father doesn't see his grandchild often either, but it's far more often than my husband and I do. I wrote a text to my son. It wasn't a nice one, but please remember I haven't been able to see my grandchild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what to do. I'm heartbroken. I did tell them I was sorry and I shouldn't have written what I did, but they still keep me at arm's length. In addition, they have just announced that I'm going to be a grandmother again. I'm not overjoyed about the news, knowing what it's been like with this first child. I'm sure it will be more of the same with the new baby. I love my grandchildren and their parents, but I'm tired of being the bad guy. Advice? — &lt;i&gt;KEPT AWAY IN TENNESSEE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR KEPT AWAY:&lt;/b&gt; It is not unusual for new mothers to gravitate toward their own mothers after the birth of a child. Why do I suspect there may be more to this estrangement than one nasty text written to your son? I wish you had mentioned what may have caused a rift between you and Kayla, whom you say you have loved since she was a little girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because apologizing to your son and daughter-in-law was not enough to assuage their anger, you are finally going to have to accept that this regrettable situation is one you cannot change on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

After living seven years up North, the citified brothers returned home to the devil they knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Sinners\" — a movie nominated for a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2026/01/22/sinners-makes-history-setting-oscars-nomination-record\"   &gt;record-breaking 16 Oscars&lt;/a&gt; — is a Jim Crow-era story of allegorical vampires wrapped in blues, sharecropping and spirituality. The film frequently nods to the unseen character Chicago: a Pullman train car in the background, the sweet Buddy Guy cameo and Outfit mob references.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago shaped the Smokestack twins, and so did World War I. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Ain’t you a soldier?\" a shopkeeper challenges a twin in \"Sinners.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I’m a soldier,\" a brother confidently says in another scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veterans like the Smokestacks fought for democracy abroad but found their country hemmed them in second-class citizenry, and that dichotomy sparked a national movement. In the 1920s, scholar &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/alain-locke#:~:text=Alain%20Locke%20(1885%2D1954)%20was%20a%20philosopher%2C%20writer%2C,traveling%20art%20exhibitions%20of%20African%20American%20artists**\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Alain Locke &lt;/a&gt;conceived the term \"New Negro\" to express an understanding of self and agency in the face of racism. The Harlem Renaissance is most closely associated to the period, but that reflected the cultural aspect. New Negro thought spread to other Northern cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-3d0000\" name=\"module-3d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I peeped the New Negro swagger of Smoke and Stack revealed early in the film. During a deal to purchase an old sawmill for a juke joint conversion, the white owner called one of the twins a boy. A twin snapped back that they were grown men, flashing money and bullets. I knew a suspected Ku Klux Klan leader wouldn’t take kindly to that urban uppity attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago’s Black population soared by more than 100,000 from 1920 to 1930, and the twins would have joined an influx of WWI vets settling on the South Side. Scholar&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/JAAHv92n3p347\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt; Chad L. Williams &lt;/a&gt;writes about the racial militancy vets brought to the New Negro ideology: \"Emerging from the war, the New Negro rejected the conservatism, parochialism, and political accommodationism of the 'Old Negro,' a signifier of individual leaders and methods of civil rights protest deemed outdated in the context of the postwar period.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 1919 Chicago race riots, vets used military-style defense of their neighborhoods from white rioters. In 1926, the Victory Monument was erected at 35th and Grand Boulevard in the Black Belt to honor an African American unit that served in France during WWI. It remains there today, the street now King Drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p080104\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“The Rise of Chicago’s Black Metropolis 1920-1929,”&lt;/a&gt; Christopher Robert Reed writes \"the New Negro personality of the 1920s bloomed and grew enormously in terms of an expanded African American worldview, expectations, and accomplishments.\" Chicago represented a place to dream, as migrants transitioned from cotton fields to concrete sidewalks. WWI produced a Black industrial proletariat. Negro women’s clubs worked to advance the race. An upper-class community of doctors, teachers, dentists and social workers expanded. Churches and new political leaders emerged alongside cultural events such as the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/08/09/billiken-parade-black-history-chicago-defender-back-to-school\"   &gt;Bud Billiken Parade&lt;/a&gt;. \"The father of gospel music,\"&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://gospelmusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame-inductees-and-honorees/thomas-a-dorsey\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt; Thomas Dorsey&lt;/a&gt;, entertained migrants who couldn’t afford the club and in 1929 switched piano blues chords for a new gospel sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Second City ingrained mark on brothers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I imagine Smoke and Stack settled in this new milieu reading the Chicago Defender, purchasing an insurance policy from a Black-owned firm and partying like a scene from an &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.peoriariverfrontmuseum.org/exhibits-collections/exhibits/archibald-motleys-bronzeville-at-night\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Archibald Motley&lt;/a&gt; painting.

At night, the twins headed to South State Street nightclubs on The Stroll. Elsewhere in the Black Belt, the Vendome, Phoenix and Grand Theaters singers &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/ethel-waters/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Ethel Waters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/lgbtq/bessie-smith\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Bessie Smith&lt;/a&gt; graced the stages. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/gertrude-ma-rainey\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Ma Rainey&lt;/a&gt; belted blues numbers at the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://cinematreasures.org/theaters/66379\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Monogram Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, a major vaudeville house on 34th and State Street. One hundred years ago this month, educator Carter G. Woodson launched &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://news.uchicago.edu/story/century-black-history-month\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Negro History Week at the Wabash YMCA&lt;/a&gt;. Later that year, on Christmas Day, police raided the Plantation and Sunset clubs for patrons doing a dance called “the black bottom.” Officers also found 20 gallons of liquor. Al Capone’s syndicate controlled those two clubs during Prohibition. Smoke and Stack probably sipped and foot-tapped in their fancy suits before hooking up with his henchmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Second City made its ingrained mark on the brothers. In \"Sinners,\" Smoke and Stack recall serving in the German trenches and hustling in Chicago gangways, their bond unshakable. One of the last scenes reveals that the former sawmill owner indeed led the KKK. It’s \"getting a little too uppity around here,\" he smirks as he and his racist pals prepare to kill Black juke joint revelers at sunrise. Only Smoke is left, and he ambushes the men, tossing grenades and triggering a machine gun; they never saw the attack coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Negro brandished his own brand of democracy, courtesy of the WWI tools and skills given to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Natalie Y.

The decrease we’ve seen since the high-water mark during the pandemic is astounding. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/criminal-justice/2025/04/16/chicagos-robbery-surge-is-over\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Starting in July 2024&lt;/a&gt;, Chicago began experiencing a double-digit drop in robberies compared to the year prior.

Fortunately, experts are fairly uniform in their assessment: We invested in communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wesley Skogan, a professor emeritus at Northwestern University who analyzes crime numbers, attributed the drop to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/criminal-justice/2025/04/16/chicagos-robbery-surge-is-over\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;the more frequent use of violence interruption programs and fully functional youth and recreational services&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-cc0000\" name=\"module-cc0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Commentary bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commentary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally recognized crime data analyst Jeff Asher likewise &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://jasher.substack.com/p/why-i-think-murder-is-plunging\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;theorizes that&lt;/a&gt;, “a strong investment in communities from private and public sources after the shock of the pandemic stands out as a major cause” of the decrease in homicides.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes money spent on infrastructure, violence intervention, job support and supporting communities. Some of the money came from state and local investments, and some from the federal government. Unfortunately, President Donald Trump is now rolling back many of these investments and using U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol and the threat of the National Guard to destabilize our communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cannot forget that we now have a blueprint for community safety that is worth pursuing. Unlike jail and prison, these community investments actually address the root causes of crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as our investments are working, some want to return to the failed “lock 'em up” policies that created mass incarceration but didn’t create safety. Trump has made a concerted effort to take credit for our success in Illinois, saying that decreases in crime — which significantly predate the federal government's invasion — are due to its reign of terror and kidnapping residents off the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as decreases in crime started long before Trump’s invasion, decreases in crime started long before the new Cook County state’s attorney took office. Crime started falling in 2023 from its COVID-19 high, and the trends in Chicago &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://jasher.substack.com/p/why-i-think-murder-is-plunging\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;mirror those we see across the country&lt;/a&gt;. This, of course, suggests that the professors and data analysts are right: Something else is afoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also know that increased jailing actually leads to negative public safety consequences long term. Studies have repeatedly shown that even &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/security=policy:eyJleHBpcnkiOjQwNzg3NjQwMDAsImNhbGwiOlsicGljayIsInJlYWQiLCJ3cml0ZSIsIndyaXRlVXJsIiwic3RvcmUiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwicmVtb3ZlIiwicnVuV29ya2Zsb3ciXX0=,signature:9df63ee50143fbd862145c8fb4ed2fcc17d068183103740b1212c4c9bc858f63/NPfbpQtCQzyQFam13VLU\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;short periods of pretrial jailing increase the likelihood that someone will be arrested again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no coincidence that the decrease in crime has coincided with the number of people jailed awaiting trial decreasing over the last decade. It’s because ensuring as many people as possible are home awaiting trial has long-term, positive consequences. People are able to keep their jobs, family and community connections and housing while awaiting their day in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When implemented, the Pretrial Fairness Act ended the use of money bond in 2023. We ensured that families would no longer have to choose between paying the rent or paying ransom to secure the constitutional right to the presumption of innocence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judges are now receiving more information and spending more time on decisions regarding pretrial release and detention. And most importantly, the law is working. In Cook County, the vast majority of people on pretrial release are succeeding. In the two years since the Pretrial Fairness Act took effect, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ocj-web-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/documents/2025-12-27_OCJ_PFA_Dashboard_New_Layout_25.12.15_FINAL.pdf?VersionId=SB34JEQ_HSHWWp197pKXbqCLujcAOTng\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;94% of the more than 130,000 people released pretrial have not been charged with new offenses against a person&lt;/a&gt;, according to summary data compiled by staff at the Cook County chief judge's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must not lose sight of what works. In 2023, in addition to ending money bond, opening back up our schools, recreation centers and public gathering spaces, we started investing in programs that have been shown to actually protect safety: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2025/april/20-Mil-Violence-Intervention-Grant.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;community violence interruption programs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/03/06/illinois-opioid-drug-overdose-deaths\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;substance use disorder treatment and harm reduction programs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicagohealthonline.com/change-makers/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;hospital-based violence intervention programs&lt;/a&gt; that support the people most affected by gun violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These investments and reforms to our criminal legal system are working. It would be a mistake to allow politicians who are focused on advancing their careers at the expense of our communities to allow us to return to the failed “public safety” policies of the past. It takes a long time for root-cause solutions to show results, and we are finally seeing the effect here in Chicago and nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Illinois state Rep.

The hands of classmates were bound with tape to symbolize chains. The teacher said that students with bound hands would be “shipped off in a cage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When his mother contacted the school, both principal and teacher denied that the reenactment took place. They were saying, in effect, that her son was lying. More anger for the mother. More distress for the son. Now he was forced to insist to his mother that he was telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fine young son of Juanyea and Alexis has been traumatized. He is nervous about going to sleep. In his dreams men are chasing him. He needs healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could someone do something, as retired TV newsman &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2026/02/10/phil-ponce-retired-chicago-tonight-host-video-latino-ice-agents\"   &gt;Phil Ponce&lt;/a&gt; has urged on another front? Could someone contact Barack Obama and ask him to send a letter of comfort? Maybe the family could be invited to the opening of the Obama Presidential Center. Maybe the positive experience of meeting a former president — the first Black president — would erase the bad dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe Obama and this boy could toss a football back and forth at the center's &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/architecture-design/2025/12/08/obama-presidential-center-home-court-building-opened-exclusive-look\"   &gt;Home Court&lt;/a&gt;, and Chicago Public Media could film it.

Many small restaurants cannot afford a delivery driver or have the ability to deliver within very short distances. I too live in Lincoln Park and find that those little robots are probably more polite than the residents who choose to have strollers larger than SUVs taking up all the room or ride electric bikes and scooters at alarming speeds on the sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those robots are keeping small businesses alive, and while they should not be allowed to overpopulate the sidewalks, they should be allowed to travel on them. We share the roads with bicycles. Why not share the sidewalk with delivery bots? As it says on their little electronic sign, the robots are \"on the job.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mary von Goeben, Lincoln Park&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Peas in a pod&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow!

The Humboldt Park resident paid the balance through the now-defunct platform PayUSAtax, which was linked on the IRS website and listed as an authorized payment provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people have complained online about PayUSAtax, which was operated by Value Payment Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Better Business Bureau has logged 294 complaints about Value Payment Systems' parent company, Catalis, over the last three years, though it reports a drop-off to 21 complaints in the last 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Johnson, executive vice president at Georgia-based Catalis, said the complaints represent a small fraction of its transactions, and most of the issues with PayUSAtax stemmed from mistyped numbers or names, or Social Security numbers and names that don't correspond, in the case of tax returns filed jointly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Occasionally, there's one that falls through the cracks,\" Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Byrne logged into the IRS website, he saw his payment status was pending. Since the money had already been charged to his credit card — along with a convenience fee of $17.82 — he figured the IRS was slow in crediting the funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, the pending status disappeared, but his account showed he still owed the IRS $979, plus interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Byrne said the IRS told him to contact PayUSAtax, who said they couldn't help and referred him back to the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By early 2025, Byrne was still trying to get his PayUSAtax payment processed by the IRS. Meanwhile, he filed his 2024 federal tax return, only for the IRS to seize almost half of his $2,561 refund.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"They claimed that they could not see a pending payment of $979, and there was no evidence I ever made a payment of that amount and that I owed the $1,057.32 that they removed from my refund,\" Byrne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He tried, unsuccessfully, to also dispute the PayUSAtax charge with his credit card issuer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I felt helpless, actually,\" Byrne said. \"No one was giving me any answers.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Sun-Times asked Catalis about Byrne's problem last summer, and the company said it would contact the IRS and try to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catalis determined Byrne didn't make any errors, and by October, it heard from the IRS that the payment \"was located [and] was unpostable.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IRS spokesperson said in a statement in January that \"some transactions, payments and returns cannot post to the master file due to programming checks for specific conditions. These conditions generate 'unpostables' that may require review and resolution determination.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS found the payment around the time of the government shutdown, which lasted from Oct. 1 through Nov. 12, affecting some IRS activities. Finally, in mid-December, the IRS sent Byrne a refund check — for $1,105.42, which included interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-8e0000\" name=\"image-8e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/00d0bb0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F15%2F9c4d9d224c8cbb57f5015b132944%2Ftaxpayusa-260222-4.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b7dc37/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F15%2F9c4d9d224c8cbb57f5015b132944%2Ftaxpayusa-260222-4.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a69b1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F15%2F9c4d9d224c8cbb57f5015b132944%2Ftaxpayusa-260222-4.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Humboldt Park resident Brendan Byrne walks by a metal fence.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a69b1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F15%2F9c4d9d224c8cbb57f5015b132944%2Ftaxpayusa-260222-4.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/41aca3c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F15%2F9c4d9d224c8cbb57f5015b132944%2Ftaxpayusa-260222-4.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a69b1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F15%2F9c4d9d224c8cbb57f5015b132944%2Ftaxpayusa-260222-4.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humboldt Park resident Brendan Byrne, said he felt “helpless” as he spent nearly two years trying to straighten out a botched tax payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;PayUSAtax would send funds to the IRS \"almost instantaneously,\" but if there was a problem, the IRS would be responsible for straightening out the issue, Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said complaints about poor customer service  were due in part to a lag in federal background checks for about two dozen extra call center workers Catalis was trying to hire in 2023. The company also created a new system in December 2023 to help taxpayers more easily check on the status of their payments, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, PayUSAtax processed about 6 million transactions, totaling about $10 billion. Johnson said the company estimated \"less than 0.1%\" of transactions had problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PayUSAtax shuttered in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson said Catalis got out of the federal tax payments business and is no longer an IRS vendor. Catalis focuses on providing software and processing payments for local governments collecting taxes, parking violation fees, child support payments and other bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS still uses third-party payment processors for taxpayers who are using their debit or credit card. The companies, Pay1040 and ACI Payments, each charge a card processing fee at rates dependent on the payment type. For example, credit card transaction fees can range from 1.75% to 1.85%.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.irs.gov/payments\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;ways to pay&lt;/a&gt; your federal income tax includes mailing a check or money order, same-day wire or direct pay, which draws the money from the taxpayer's bank account for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS also allows certain filers to apply for a payment plan, though some may charge a user fee, which can be reduced, waived or reimbursed depending on a taxpayer's income. &lt;/p&gt;",

He said he was a gold miner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, officers on a drug task force had taken his luggage from an Amtrak train at Union Station in Chicago. Inside was $115,000 in cash. To them it was the usual thing. A one-way ticket. A suitcase full of bills. A long trip across the country. They had seen it before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ross said the money came from the ground. He worked claims in Oregon and California. He said he pulled gold from the earth and sold it, and this was the return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyer, Stephen Komie, knew how it sounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one was going to believe it unless we could prove it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Ross brought him some rock solid evidence: a gold nugget, dull and heavy, small enough to sit in the palm. He said he had dug it out himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komie carried it into federal court and set it down before the judge, U.S. District Judge Robert Dow. The judge picked it up. He turned it in his hand and looked at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Judge Dow examined the gold,” Komie says. “And that was the end of any question that he was a gold miner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late January, the government agreed to give the money back. There was no apology. Nothing on the record to say why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ross, the loss had cut deep, Komie says. He went without the money for about seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Mining takes tools. It takes chemicals and fuel. It takes trucks and long drives into rough country. Without money, there is no work. It was catastrophic,\" Komie says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. attorney's office in Chicago declined to comment on the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-db0000\" name=\"image-db0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/50595ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F87%2F69%2F4fc90033484e8149c3f7cac03811%2Fkomie-gold.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/06ff87d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F87%2F69%2F4fc90033484e8149c3f7cac03811%2Fkomie-gold.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1aac82e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F87%2F69%2F4fc90033484e8149c3f7cac03811%2Fkomie-gold.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Lawyer Stephen Komie holds a gold nugget in the palm of his hand.

The law allows officers to take money and property they believe is tied to crime. They do not have to arrest anyone. They do not have to file charges. The owner must go to court and try to win it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ross’s money was taken through the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Transportation Interdiction Program. For years, agents and local police have worked airports, train stations and bus terminals. They watched travelers. They asked questions. They searched bags for drugs and for cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the Justice Department’s inspector general looked at 100 cash seizures made through the program. Most, a report said, were carried out without any prior intelligence about a specific drug crime. Many did not lead to arrests. The watchdog said DEA could not tell whether the seizures risked civil liberties, moved investigations forward or stopped crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2024, the inspector general weighed in again. A memo spoke of poor training in the program. It described a traveler who missed his flight after agents searched his bag. They found no drugs. They found no cash. The stop had begun with a tip from an airline employee. The employee had received tens of thousands of dollars from the DEA for information about passengers thought to be suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo prompted the attorney general’s office under President Joe Biden to suspend the program in November 2024. The DEA terminated it in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"For some airline workers, tipping off the DEA pays off big\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;For some airline workers, tipping off the DEA pays off big&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-980000\" name=\"image-980000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/989d469/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5a%2Fe5%2F9e847bb14c73a0c0f06345442d36%2Funionstation-072325-016.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4182549/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5a%2Fe5%2F9e847bb14c73a0c0f06345442d36%2Funionstation-072325-016.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/482b499/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5a%2Fe5%2F9e847bb14c73a0c0f06345442d36%2Funionstation-072325-016.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The renovated Great Hall in Union Station at 225 S.

Some of the judges say we’re just acting on a hunch, but we do have strong reasonable suspicion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the future of the Transportation Interdiction Program is not settled. After Donald Trump returned to office, Drug Enforcement Administration lawyers told the courts the agency might revive some version of it. They spoke of more training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without the program, officers are allowed to take cash at airports and stations if it is tied to an active criminal investigation, the attorney general’s office had said when the 2024 suspension was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The money involved is considerable. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2024, U.S. attorneys reported more than half a billion dollars in civil asset forfeitures across the country. The Northern District of Illinois ranked third in total value, behind the Central District of California and the District of Columbia. More than $60 million was reported in the Chicago region alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, the DEA accounts for about 80% of civil asset forfeitures, according to the inspector general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;How the stops worked&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Union Station and at O’Hare and Midway airports, agents from the DEA worked with local police on a task force called Group 24. They read passenger lists. They studied ticket records. In their reports, they wrote about one-way tickets bought close to departure, about cash payments, about third-party credit cards. These were signs, they said, of drug couriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They approached travelers for what they called consensual interviews. In the reports, the traveler was often described as nervous. The agents asked for permission to search the luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the traveler said no, as Ross did, the agents could call for a dog trained to detect drugs. If the dog alerted, that was enough to take the bags and hold them while they sought a warrant to open them. Travelers were given a receipt and went on their way without their luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the property back, owners had to file a claim in federal court. Sometimes that meant coming back to Chicago at their  own expense, to stand before a judge and say the money was theirs and not the government’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e40000\" name=\"image-e40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d0cb975/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1c%2F75%2Fec1cd42245dc94aab602d858444a%2Fkomie-office.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/54daa62/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1c%2F75%2Fec1cd42245dc94aab602d858444a%2Fkomie-office.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7092d19/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1c%2F75%2Fec1cd42245dc94aab602d858444a%2Fkomie-office.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Lawyer Stephen Komie in his Loop office.

At shows and small exchanges, raw minerals change hands for bills counted out on folding tables. Gold dust. Flakes. Nuggets wrapped in cotton gauze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says the agents ignored obvious evidence about Ross that should have cut against their suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside Ross’s luggage was a bill of sale. It listed “gold dust, pickers, flakes and nuggets weighing 88.5 ounces from southern Oregon mining claims.” Ross was named as the seller. Records from the Bureau of Land Management show he holds mining claims in Oregon and California, Komie says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the government might have been more focused on other information: Ross also had an ownership interest in a recreational marijuana dispensary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for a drug-detection dog’s alert on Ross’s money, Komie calls it thin proof. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies and media experiments have long suggested that a significant portion of circulating U.S. currency carries trace amounts of narcotics residue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a widely cited 1985 test arranged by the Miami Herald, dogs alerted to bills carried by public figures including a future attorney general, Janet Reno, and a future Florida governor, Jeb Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money passes through many hands. It carries what it has touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tilted scales&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odds of getting seized money back are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal report once estimated that only about 5% of owners succeed in reclaiming their property. In many cases, no one files a claim at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some travelers may have been involved in crime and decided they were fortunate not to be arrested. They let the money go and did not invite more attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others may have done the math. A lawyer costs money. Time costs money. A trip back to court costs money. For some, the fight would cost more than what was taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the cash stays with the government, and the suitcase does not come home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-e90000\" name=\"module-e90000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Some of Chicago’s civil forfeiture losers — and their alibis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\" id=\"rte-146f20a0-0ce4-11f1-abcf-d7bfe8cf2af5\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2005, a woman said she was taking $15,000 to her sick aunt in Mexico. DEA task force officers found money order receipts in her luggage for inmates locked up in federal prison. She forfeited the money seized at the Amtrak terminal at Union Station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2015, a man said he was taking $330,000 to Oregon to buy racing pigeons and a car. He forfeited the money seized at Union Station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also in 2015, a man said he was traveling with $76,480 he used to service ATM machines. He never filed a claim for the money seized at O’Hare Airport, and the money was forfeited.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komie calls himself the “Dean of Forfeitures” on his firm’s website. He has made a practice of fighting these seizures. It's steady work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review of 20 Chicago cases he has handled since 1992 shows he often gets at least something back for his clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven recovered all their money. The total was $864,000. One was a salesman from China who carried $294,000 in cash through Union Station after attending a jade show in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine others settled. Prosecutors returned $357,000 and kept $638,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four lost everything. Together, they forfeited $257,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them was Nicholas Marrocco. He fought for 15 years. In 2018, a federal appeals court ruled against him. He lost $101,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says many lawyers will not take smaller cases on contingency. The money is not enough to justify the risk. And many criminal defense attorneys do not know the narrow rules and strict deadlines that govern forfeiture law. It is its own kind of fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The scale is tilted in the government’s favor,” Komie says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2016/4/18/18404540/13-years-later-man-s-war-with-u-s-over-shoebox-cash-rages-on\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;13 years later, man’s war with U.S. over ‘shoebox’ cash rages on&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2016/4/18/18360688/government-shouldn-t-seize-assets-without-greater-proof-of-crime\n\n\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Government shouldn’t seize assets without greater proof of crime&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e60000\" name=\"image-e60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/da1077b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1986x1115+0+96/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff7%2F73%2F1eb93ee340dbb415875d484f64be%2F11-5-white-henry-hyde-3-1.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1b1bcfa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1986x1115+0+96/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff7%2F73%2F1eb93ee340dbb415875d484f64be%2F11-5-white-henry-hyde-3-1.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a7cf349/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1986x1115+0+96/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff7%2F73%2F1eb93ee340dbb415875d484f64be%2F11-5-white-henry-hyde-3-1.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The late U.S. Rep.

Agencies that seize assets can keep the proceeds, using them to buy vehicles, equipment and other items. State and local departments can share in the funds if they participate in federal task forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Police Department has been among the agencies benefiting from federal forfeitures. In 2021, the Justice Department’s inspector general criticized the department for lacking adequate policies to track how it spent those funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say allowing agencies to keep what they seize creates what the late U.S. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., once called “contingent fee law enforcement.” In 1996, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, he held hearings questioning the constitutionality of civil cash seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are confronted in Illinois with a system that has run amok,” Hyde said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komie testified at Hyde’s hearings. He warned that forfeited cash could be spent with little oversight from elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courts, too, have expressed concern over the years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1997, Judge William Bauer wrote for the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals that a Chicago pizzeria owner should get back more than $500,000 seized from him by Chicago police officers and \"adopted\" by the federal government for civil forfeiture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We reiterate that the government may not seize money, even half a million dollars, based on its bare assumption that most people do not have huge sums of money lying about, and if they do, they must be involved in narcotics trafficking or some other sinister activity,\" Bauer said, adding, \"As has likely been obvious from the tone of this opinion, we believe the government's conduct in forfeiture cases leaves much to be desired.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, an Illinois appellate court ordered the return of $280,000 seized from a Canadian traveler at Union Station. Chicago cops seized the money more than a decade earlier. The court held that purchasing a one-way train ticket in cash less than 24 hours before departure, standing alone, did not establish probable cause to search luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komie represented the claimants in both cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legislative and legal challenges&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Capitol Hill, lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have have tried and failed to tighten the rules in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their latest effort, U.S. Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., have sponsored the FAIR Act, which would require the federal government to meet a higher burden of proof before permanently taking property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pending legislation would also direct forfeited funds to the U.S. Treasury rather than to law enforcement agencies, reducing what supporters describe as a financial incentive to seize assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar bill is expected to be introduced in the House on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Stories about a grocer in Michigan, a restaurant owner in Iowa and farmers in Maryland have all exposed government overreach within the civil asset forfeiture process,\" a sponsor, U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., said in a statement. \"We must put the presumption of innocence back where it belongs, on the side of the American people.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meantime, the debate over civil asset forfeiture is playing out in Pittsburgh, Pa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit filed there in 2020 challenges a DEA seizure of $82,373 from a Pennsylvania man who said the money represented his life savings. A woman from Florida and a man from California joined him. Their cash had been taken at airports as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are asking a federal judge to stop the agency from making those kinds of seizures in the future. They want the case to proceed as a class action for other travelers who say their money was taken the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DEA says the dispute is moot. It canceled the program last year, the agency says, and there is nothing left to challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in court filings, its lawyers did not rule out bringing back the Transportation Interdiction Program with some changes. The agency declined to answer questions about those filings.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DEA continuously evaluates the effectiveness of its investigatory techniques and adapts in accordance with the law,” an agency spokesperson said, referring the Sun-Times to the Justice Department “for information related to future policies under the Administration.”   &lt;/p&gt;",

For joint filers, the amount has increased to $30 million. The individual limit has tripled from $5 million in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will the increased exemption affect you? Most Americans will not be affected, at least not directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new policy amounts to an estimated $5.7 million tax cut for the wealthiest residents, or 1 in 1000 estates, who glean the majority of their income from investments. In 2026, there are about 4,000 estates that exceed the exemption amount. By contrast, the average wealth transfer from baby boomers to their heirs is expected to fall short of $335,000 over the next 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The primary effect of the tax change on most people is the federal government's larger deficit and the likely need to raise taxes or cut spending in the future,\" certified financial planner and estate planning attorney Ari Weisbard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increased exemption is estimated to raise the national deficit by more than $212 billion over the next 10 years. For lower-income Americans, the massive increase in the estate tax exemption in recent years can be felt in the form of decreased revenue for public services such as Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and federal student loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the limited few who may leave behind enough assets to surpass the exemption limit, careful tax planning is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"First, get very clear on your net worth, as the IRS imposes the tax on all assets, including your home, retirement accounts and business interests and even the death benefit of your life insurance,\" Todd Villarrubia, tax lawyer and founding partner of Wealth Planning Law Group, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to amounts that surpass the exemption limit, a progressive federal tax rate of 18% to 40% will apply. So for an inheritance of $20 million from an individual benefactor, the heir could be taxed up to 40% on the $5 million that surpasses the federal exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that said, estate taxes can still be reduced or even avoided altogether through strategic tax planning, including the use of trusts, charitable giving and portability, which gives married individuals the option to transfer the unused portion of their exemption to their surviving spouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who want to leave assets behind but fall far short of the exemption amount, there are still reasons to pay attention to the changes and consider updating your tax strategy. For example, if you live in a state with an estate tax exemption that's far lower than the federal threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The Illinois tax has a much lower exemption than the federal system,\" Villarubia said. \"So families can owe Illinois tax even when no federal estate taxes are due.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's exemption remains at $4 million, where it was set in 2014. For assets that surpass that level, a state tax rate of 0.8% to 16% can apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like federal taxpayers, Illinoisans can use gifting and trusts to shield them from estate taxes for over-limit assets. However, Weisbard advised proceeding with caution, since the state tax rate is much lower than the federal rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois residents should also keep in mind that the value of their assets is calculated differently for state versus federal taxes. For those reasons, it's best to seek guidance from a qualified tax adviser or estate-planning attorney familiar with Illinois tax policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another group that should take heed of the change is high net worth taxpayers who could have more valuable assets to pass on in the future. Even if you fall short of the limit today, consider the possibility that the future returns on your investments could push the value of your total assets beyond the federal or state exemption levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you come close to the new exemption amount or not, it's wise to occasionally revisit your estate planning strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Many households with estate plans from many years ago have complicated living trusts and other arrangements that made sense when the estate tax exemption was much lower than it is today,\" Weisbard said. \"These households should consult their attorney about revising their plans to make them simpler and avoid the negative capital gains tax consequences of these estate tax avoidance strategies that are no longer necessary.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

In return, users receive more of the crypto that was staked, similar to the benefits of interest-bearing bank accounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airdrop is when a new crypto project launches and sends out free tokens to a select group, often as part of a broader marketing effort for the new currency. Receiving these coins count as a taxable event when the recipient is able to use or access the currency, according to TurboTax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using crypto to buy goods and services also creates a taxable event, just like selling it for cash, according to Mark Gallegos, tax partner at Porte Brown’s Elgin office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So everyday transactions, like buying a cup of coffee with crypto, can technically create a tax reporting obligation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long a filer held their crypto before selling or exchanging it can determine its tax rate, similar to how investments are taxed by the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you owned the currency for one year or less before spending or selling it, any profits are typically considered short-term capital gains, taxed at your ordinary income rate that could be between 10% and 37%. If you held it for more than one year, profits are typically long-term capital gains that are subject to tax rates at either 0%, 15% or 20%, according to TurboTax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital transactions, including crypto, should be reported on Form 8949, where taxpayers must report personal sales, trades and crypto positions, including acquisition and sales dates, proceeds, cost basis and the resulting gain or loss. The tally is documented on Schedule D, which summarizes your overall capital gains or losses for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other income, such as interest earned or staking earnings, these are reported by taxpayers on Schedule B or Schedule 1, said Curt Mastio, managing partner at Chicago-based Founder’s CPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you received crypto as income, it's taxed by the IRS as ordinary income based on the fair market value at the time you were paid. And you must report the funds on your return, even if you didn't receive a Form 1099-NEC or W-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you dispose of or sell digital assets, you generally subtract your basis [or fair market value at purchase] from the fair market value at disposition to compute gain or loss,” Mastio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a filer isn't keeping track of each transaction's capital gains or losses, it can become difficult to untangle when tax season arrives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the IRS may still have ways of tracking your crypto activity, according to TurboTax. Some exchanges that provide filers Form 1099-B will report client trades to the IRS. The federal agency also uses blockchain analytics tools to identify the crypto activity of digital wallets, especially to help spot suspected tax evasion or money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 2026 tax year, crypto brokers and exchanges are required to issue clients a Form 1099-DA, or the Digital Asset Proceeds From Broker Transactions form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It will catch a lot of people by surprise ... when it goes into effect,” Slettengren said. “In essence, the IRS knows your crypto holdings and it is time to start paying your taxes now if you have not reported in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For taxes due in April, service providers like Coinbase or Robinhood were only required to report sales during the calendar year on Form 1099-DA but that stipulation changed on Jan. 1, according to Brian Kearns, founder of Haddam Road Advisors in Evanston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Starting in 2026, custodians will also need to provide basis information for gains and losses for crypto assets,” he said. “If your crypto is not held by a custodian, you alone are responsible for reporting gains and losses and for calculating the requisite tax.”&lt;/p&gt;",

And the deduction is available to filers who take the standard deduction or itemize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new senior deduction is also on top of the extra standard deduction of $2,000 for single filers, or $1,600 per qualifying individual for married joint filers, aged 65 or older. That extra deduction increases by $50 for the 2026 tax year, or returns due in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior deduction may bring some much needed relief to taxpayers grappling with inflation at the grocery store and increased health care and housing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tax Foundation estimates that on average, each household with a qualifying senior will see a roughly $780 increase in their take-home pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the nonprofit said low-income retirees will likely miss out because they already benefit from the standard and extra $2,000 deduction, and their tax liability is close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 2025 tax year, the standard deduction is $15,750, or $31,500 for married filing jointly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior deduction phases out at a 6% rate for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income over $75,000, or $150,000 for joint filers. Single filers with an income above $175,000 and married filers with an income above $250,000 are ineligible for the tax deduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the deduction is supposed to provide some relief for eligible seniors, it may not have an impact on deciding whether to itemize or claim the standard deduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of seniors are probably taking the standard deduction [versus itemizing] … just because it’s so high. For 2025, if you’re filing jointly, the standard deduction is $31,500, which is a really huge amount. On top of that, there is an additional standard deduction for senior citizens, and then, on top of that, there’s this new enhanced deduction for seniors,” Shaun Hunley, tax expert and executive editor at Thomson Reuters, said in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They could get up to $46,700 when combining all three deductions. That’s a huge amount, so I would say, overall, most seniors are probably taking the standard deduction, unless they have high medical expenses, because that’s an itemized deduction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Illinois seniors, the deduction wouldn’t apply to their state income tax return. That’s because the senior deduction is a “below-the-line” deduction, meaning it’s reported after your adjusted gross income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois taxable income starts from the federal adjusted gross income, which means the senior deduction wouldn’t be factored into the AGI reported on your state return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greg Mermel, certified public accountant and partner at Chicago-based Mermel-Goldman CPAs, said many Illinois filers may not even notice the absence of the $6,000 deduction because the state doesn’t tax Social Security, pension or retirement plan income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It really only benefits middle-income taxpayers because people who are just scraping by on Social Security — who there are far too many in America — are not paying taxes anyway,” Mermel said.&lt;/p&gt;",

Among the other linguistic items are boarding school materials that were translated into Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of these materials provide an important connection to the past and an important connection to ancestors,” Miron said. “I have seen people in the collection weep upon seeing something that is related to their family, or is related to their community that they've never seen before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tribal nations can also request digitization of other parts of the collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mellon funds will also be used to hire three additional staff members, including a second dedicated librarian for the Indigenous collection. Additionally, the dollars will go toward fellowships for people who work for tribal nations, travel for tribal members to visit the collection and for librarians to visit tribal nations. Some grant funds are intended, too, for compensation for tribal members who help the library review items in the collection and for in-depth projects with partner tribal nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, Newberry says, more than half the funds will go directly to tribal nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We fundamentally believe that tribal nations are the best representatives of their own history,” said Miron, adding that the library is also open to repatriating items in its collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-530000\" name=\"image-530000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72632ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+226/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2F54%2F807dc9ad43ac8426afb9fbd38151%2F3-schoolcraft-ayer-e77-s41-plt-60-o3-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1cc879c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+226/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2F54%2F807dc9ad43ac8426afb9fbd38151%2F3-schoolcraft-ayer-e77-s41-plt-60-o3-1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1b95896/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+226/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2F54%2F807dc9ad43ac8426afb9fbd38151%2F3-schoolcraft-ayer-e77-s41-plt-60-o3-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Symbolic Petition of the Cippewa Chiefs\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1b95896/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+226/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2F54%2F807dc9ad43ac8426afb9fbd38151%2F3-schoolcraft-ayer-e77-s41-plt-60-o3-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/994381e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+226/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2F54%2F807dc9ad43ac8426afb9fbd38151%2F3-schoolcraft-ayer-e77-s41-plt-60-o3-1.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1b95896/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+226/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2F54%2F807dc9ad43ac8426afb9fbd38151%2F3-schoolcraft-ayer-e77-s41-plt-60-o3-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This image, part of Newberry’s collection, represents the clans of the ogimaag (chiefs) of the Lake Superior bands of Ojibwe.

Ayer, whom Miron said was an avid collector of books, manuscripts, artwork and publications about different tribal nations. Ayer also endowed the collection, and that has allowed the Newberry to grow the collection over the years and dedicate a librarian to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Miron said, the approach to expanding this collection has shifted to “prioritizing materials created by Native people rather than just materials about Native people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest round of Mellon funding is an extension of a previous planning grant, which the museum received in 2020. The planning process resulted in the “&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/curious-city/2024/11/21/indigenous-chicago-project-shows-the-city-has-always-been-a-native-place\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Indigenous Chicago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” project, which looks to provide information and resources on Chicago’s historic and modern-day Indigenous communities. It includes interactive online maps that reinterpret Chicago’s history from Native American perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project comes amid other recent local efforts to better recognize Indigenous people and their culture. A new partnership between the American Indian Center of Chicago and the Forest Preserve of Kane County led to the introduction of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/environment/2026/01/23/burlington-prairie-bison-herd-kane-county-illinois-native-americans\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a new bison herd&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the animals to the local tallgrass prairie for the first time in 200 years. The center will steward the herd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her role at the library, Miron said she is conscious of the way institutions like Newberry have contributed to pain inflicted upon Indigenous communities. “As an institution that has benefited from colonialism, I really see it as our job to try to undo some of that harm and to really return control to tribal nations,” Miron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grant work is now underway and will continue through December 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Courtney Kueppers is an arts and culture reporter at WBEZ.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Either way, the matter lands with a top administrator at the state’s financial and professional regulation department for a final decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators don’t need to prove the allegations against Dobrescu, only that another jurisdiction took “adverse action” against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"

graduate of Northwestern University and raised in Munster, Indiana, Dobrescu has portrayed the central allegations against him in Alaska as “false,” saying the investigator’s affidavit was rife with misinformation and laid the mistakes of others on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the complaining doctors alleged that Dobrescu “used a nonstandard strategy of transecting the aorta entirely to gain access to the aortic valve, which led to significant bleeding that Dr. Dobrescu was unable to remedy,” according to the affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dobrescu “was confronted with the severe bleeding from his suture lines,” he persisted “in a failing strategy of adding stitches... and refused to perform hypothermic circulatory arrest despite repeated recommendations to do so,” according to the affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaining doctor said that “in efforts to repair the bleeding that Dr. Dobrescu had caused, Dr. Dobrescu inadvertently perforated the pulmonary artery,” the affidavit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dobrescu has, in turn, pointed blame for the outcome of the surgery on one of the complaining doctors, an anesthesiologist, who Dobrescu alleged “did not replace blood products correctly” as the patient bled out, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anesthesiologist has insisted he acted properly, and an administrative law judge in Alaska concluded in 2025 that “the evidence is too ambiguous to make a clear finding on whether there were departures from the standard of care in the final administration of blood products,” records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge also seemed to find no major fault in how Dobrescu performed the surgery, writing: “Fundamentally, the demonstrated problem with this surgery is not its execution, but instead that it probably should not have been occurring in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge hammered Dobrescu for forging ahead with an operation not deemed urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"

surgery on December 7 overlooked important risk factors” — including “poor” diabetes control in the patient — “as did his downstream failure to reconsider up to the hour of surgery,” the judge wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The decision-making process fell below the standard of care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge wrote that the patient’s death “was substantially related to the substandard pre-operative risk evaluation,” and that after “losing a patient in this manner, the licensee” — Dobrescu — “exhibited deeply irresponsible behavior by failing to provide an operative report.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dobrescu said he was “put in an impossible position” because his lawyer advised not to immediately release that report due to  concerns it would be used to help prosecute him for negligent homicide, though a criminal case never materialized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An autopsy could have provided more clarity over the man’s death, but for reasons still unclear one wasn’t conducted initially and wasn’t possible later because the patient had been cremated, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge’s ruling also found regulators had “proven” that Dobrescu “obtained licensure in Alaska by fraud” by failing to reveal on his paperwork that he “was under active investigation in Virginia” administratively “for incompetence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dobrescu argued that a consultant he’d hired to complete the application advised that the Virginia investigation — which examined his personal and professional conduct in a number of states — didn’t need to be disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alaska patient’s daughter testified at Alaska’s administrative hearing that she was there when her father was wheeled into surgery, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hugged him, and I kissed him, and I told him to do good,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And he said, ‘Don't tell me. Tell them to do good.’”&lt;/p&gt;",

What's normal in the city's majority-Latino communities today isn't what it was before Operation Midway Blitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southeast Side, long defined by steel mills and working-class communities, was one of the first places Mexicans came to Chicago more than a century ago. On the Lower West Side, Pilsen stands out for its colorful murals, rich arts and culinary scene and lively Mexican American culture. Farther southwest, Little Village, also known as La Villita, has a vibrant commercial corridor and community celebrations like the Mexican Independence Day parade that are among the oldest and largest in the Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neighborhoods carved separate paths to becoming majority-Latino and cultural centers for Mexican communities in Chicago. But they shared a common experience last fall: the Trump administration's Operation Midway Blitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/live/2025/09/16/cbp-raids-ice-chicago-elgin-operation-at-large\"   &gt;The immigration enforcement campaign began Sept. 16,&lt;/a&gt; Mexican Independence Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal officials said the operation targeted violent criminals without legal status, though &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/03/28/tren-de-aragua-venezuela-gang-trump-tom-homan-terrorism-violence-crime-chicago-colombia-honduras-ecuador-nicolas-maduro-salvador\"   &gt;this proved largely untrue&lt;/a&gt;. As enforcement increased, fear spread across Chicago and its suburbs. Latino and immigrant-majority neighborhoods, including Pilsen, Little Village and the Southeast Side, went on high alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These communities developed their Latino identities over generations, shaped by migration, labor and displacement.

Many arrived in 1919, when they were recruited during a national steel mill strike. These communities became part of the backbone of heavily industrial South Chicago and the East Side, creating an identity that endures today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1923, the community established Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, the first Mexican American parish in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2023, Latinos on the East Side and South Chicago made up half of the neighborhoods’ 52,000 residents, according to the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. The East Side alone is nearly 90% Latino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stories from South Chicago and the Southeast Side&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sc-masa\"   &gt;Cecy’s Molino de Masa&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sc-maria\"   &gt;Maria&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#ses-natg\"   &gt;Illinois National Guard member&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sc-pedraza\"   &gt;Corina Pedraza&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#ses-bautista\"   &gt;Olga Bautista&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"pilsen-top\" name=\"pilsen-top\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c107295/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/efbfe2a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53a3f35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Maria Ruiz and Rita sit atop a car in the Mexican Independence Day Parade as it travels down East 91st Street on the Southeast Side on Sept. 15, 1957.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53a3f35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2efd0e4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53a3f35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria Ruiz and Rita sit atop a car in the Mexican Independence Day Parade as it travels down East 91st Street on the Southeast Side on Sept. 15, 1957.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southeast Chicago Historical Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pilsen&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Pilsen became known for its Mexican and Mexican American identity — its streets lined with colorful murals, Mexican stores and restaurants — the neighborhood was home to waves of European immigrants. Named after Plzeň in what is now the Czech Republic, Pilsen began to change in the mid-20th century as Mexican and Puerto Rican families moved in, many displaced from the Near West Side by expressway construction and the expansion of the University of Illinois Chicago campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the 1960s, Pilsen had become predominantly Latino, shaped by social activism, civic engagement and artistic expression. Today, Pilsen is 68% Latino and Hispanic, according to U.S. Census data. In recent years, rising housing costs and new development have raised concerns about gentrification and the displacement of longtime residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stories from Pilsen and the Southwest Side&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#pils-alejandra\"   &gt;Alejandra&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sw-progresando\"   &gt;Latinos Progresando&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"lv-top\" name=\"lv-top\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a5c4ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/777bfd5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49a8def/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mexican students protest at Froebel school in 1973.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49a8def/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4529303/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49a8def/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexican students protest at the Froebel Branch of Harrison High School at 2021 W. 21st St. in Chicago, May 5, 1973.

But Little Village’s white residents still moved to the suburbs, leaving room for Mexican families, many of whom were pushed west from Pilsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1980, Latinos made up nearly half of Little Village’s population, with Mexicans as the dominant group. In 1990, the Mexican government donated the Little Village arch, cementing the neighborhood's identity. It reads “Bienvenidos a Little Village.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neighborhood was proud of its roots. Many began to call Little Village the “Mexico of the Midwest.” The latest U.S. Census data shows South Lawndale, still the area’s official name, is 81% Latino and Hispanic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pilsen and Little Village corridor now has the largest concentration of Latinos in the Midwest. Little Village’s 26th Street commercial corridor generates millions in annual revenue and is the city's second highest tax-generating district, after the Magnificent Mile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stories from Little Village/La Villita&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#lv-viento\"   &gt;Viento, the running club&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#lv-morenos\"   &gt;Moreno’s Liquors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"  data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-6e0000\" name=\"image-6e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b0e00db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/51731da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e14a6c4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Funeral and procession for Rudy Lozano\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e14a6c4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1ef1083/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e14a6c4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1983, Rudy Lozano, a Mexican-American community activist who was instrumental in campaigning for the election of Harold Washington as mayor, was murdered in his home following Washington’s victory.

Gregory Bovino told a WBEZ reporter that some people are arrested based partly &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/09/28/ice-agents-spotted-downtown-on-michigan-avenue-along-chicago-river\"   &gt;on “how they look.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the operation, on Nov. 10, dozens of Border Patrol agents posed Downtown in front of The Bean. As they prepared to take the picture, an agent reportedly said, “Everyone say ‘Little Village!” According to media reports, the agents shouted back “Little Village!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In between, federal agents &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/05/daycare-teacher-taken-by-ice-north-side-immigration\"   &gt;disrupted daily life&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in places like Little Village, Pilsen and the Southeast Side. Immigrants and other Chicagoans feared detention while walking outside, waiting for the bus or taking children to school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some neighborhoods, the streets were empty. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/07/chicago-business-civic-leaders-ice-economy\"   &gt;Business owners saw drastic declines in sales.&lt;/a&gt; Some feared having to close. Community events and parades were canceled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neighborhoods known for their vibrancy and close-knit community life were quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families feared separation, and parents worried about the long-term impact on their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/06/judge-sara-ellis-operation-midway-blitz-tear-gas-deportation-campaign\"   &gt;Critics of the immigration operations pointed to violent tactics&lt;/a&gt;, performative operations and unconstitutional detentions. Supporters said the federal government was targeting violent and dangerous immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to U.S. Department of Justice documents, 97% of those detained during Operation Midway Blitz had no criminal records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration continued to push the narrative that it was taking murders and rapists off the streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the agents posed at The Bean, they began leaving Chicago. The federal influx of some 300 agents for Operation Midway Blitz ended. But ICE enforcement — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — continues.

   \n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Operation Midway Blitz, the captains and runners of Viento, the Little Village run club, would message each other only to cancel a run. Now they message to check if there have been sightings of federal agents and then decide when they’ll run and their route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm usually checking in, ‘How are you all personally?’ but also, ‘What do you think about running today? What's something that we should keep an eye on?’” says Jess Vergara, 37, who was part of the group that created the club 13 years ago. “So we are prepared when things kind of pop up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The club has a new rule: No one can run by themselves. Vergara says runners will slow down or run back to make sure no one is too far behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viento means \"wind\" in Spanish. The club is mostly Latino and runs three times a week, meeting at 26th Street and South Central Park Avenue, as they have for 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents recognize them. Business owners wave as they pass, and members often gather after runs at restaurants for coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal immigration agents arrived in September, about a month before the Chicago Marathon. For many runners, not running wasn’t an option after weeks of training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vergara and the other captains wanted to keep the runners safe. They mapped out routes and water stops; they identified safe havens in case agents targeted them. Members provided emergency contacts in case any runners were detained. The club held Know Your Rights training for runners and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Vergara says, they are trying to keep the runners motivated, but they are also preparing, in case the feds come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are constantly checking the news, what other organizations are doing in La Villita and around Chicago,” she says. “We keep in touch with the rapid response teams and see what they're saying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's such a different feeling. It's this constant vigilance and heightened anxiety.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#lv-top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"lv-morenos\" name=\"lv-morenos\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Little Village: Moreno’s Liquors&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        &lt;bsp-carousel class=\"Carousel Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"gallery-e30023\" name=\"gallery-e30023\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slides\"&gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slide\"&gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-media\"&gt;\n        \n            \n                \n                    &lt;picture data-crop=\"large\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1204764/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x4045+0+19/resize/840x555!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2F57%2F8f254b3642c8a8e379d4c823af11%2Fblitzeffect-260215-31.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f90045d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x4045+0+19/resize/1680x1110!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2F57%2F8f254b3642c8a8e379d4c823af11%2Fblitzeffect-260215-31.jpg 2x\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9501cde/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x4045+0+19/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2F57%2F8f254b3642c8a8e379d4c823af11%2Fblitzeffect-260215-31.jpg\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mike Moreno Jr. and Mike Moreno Sr. at 3724 W. 26th St. in Little Village.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9501cde/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x4045+0+19/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2F57%2F8f254b3642c8a8e379d4c823af11%2Fblitzeffect-260215-31.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6391914/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x4045+0+19/resize/1680x1110!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2F57%2F8f254b3642c8a8e379d4c823af11%2Fblitzeffect-260215-31.jpg 2x\" width=\"840\" height=\"555\"\n        src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9501cde/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x4045+0+19/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2F57%2F8f254b3642c8a8e379d4c823af11%2Fblitzeffect-260215-31.jpg\"&gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n                \n            \n        \n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-info\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-infoTitle\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-infoDescription\"&gt;Mike Moreno Jr. and Mike Moreno Sr. at Moreno’s Liquors, 3724 W. 26th St. in Little Village.

Customers have started to return, “but people have this uneasiness,” store owner Mike Moreno Jr. says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They send him messages asking if he can verify the area is clear of immigration agents before they go out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before immigration came in, if somebody saw a drone, no one thought anything of it,\" Moreno says. \"If somebody saw a helicopter flying over, they thought, 'OK, it's the news checking traffic or Chicago Police Department doing something.' Now people are scared.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreno, 34, is a third-generation entrepreneur. He grew up in Archer Heights. His grandfather immigrated to the United States in the 1960s, and his family later moved to Little Village, where they were among the first Mexican families in the neighborhood. In 1977, his father opened Moreno’s Liquors, which became one of the first Latino-owned liquor stores in Illinois. In 2019, Moreno expanded the business with Osito’s Tap, a speakeasy next door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the presence of federal agents last fall, people stayed inside, Moreno says. Sales dropped 20% at first, as much as 60% at one point, and leveled off at a 40% drop for two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says his business hasn’t fully recovered, and perhaps it won’t any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's the perfect storm. You've got inflation that's at an all-time high, you have tariffs that are exasperating that. Layoffs are happening across the board,” Moreno says. “You put all of those together, and the last thing you need is for people to be scared to even go out and shop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one should be treated like that. It’s disrespectful and inhumane,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreno says his family taught him the importance of civic engagement and advocacy. His father helped establish the Little Village Chamber of Commerce and worked with community leaders to build the neighborhood’s iconic arch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though there was fear in the fall, Moreno says, residents came together, and the moment could unite Latinos across communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To see people helping each other, bringing food to an abuelita who was afraid to go out or warning neighbors about threats, that was inspiring,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We won’t give up,” he adds. “Todo juntos. We’re in this together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#lv-top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"sc-masa\" name=\"sc-masa\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;South Chicago: Cecy’s Molino de Masa&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        &lt;bsp-carousel class=\"Carousel Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"gallery-a20008\" name=\"gallery-a20008\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slides\"&gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slide\"&gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-media\"&gt;\n        \n            \n                \n                    &lt;picture data-crop=\"large\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e90a353/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7302x4825+0+23/resize/840x555!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Faf%2Fbfbda29a48de8b8a9ee6bac06eba%2Fblitzeffect-260215-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/922b23a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7302x4825+0+23/resize/1680x1110!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Faf%2Fbfbda29a48de8b8a9ee6bac06eba%2Fblitzeffect-260215-08.jpg 2x\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff1d075/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7302x4825+0+23/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Faf%2Fbfbda29a48de8b8a9ee6bac06eba%2Fblitzeffect-260215-08.jpg\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"BLITZEFFECT_260215-08.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff1d075/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7302x4825+0+23/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Faf%2Fbfbda29a48de8b8a9ee6bac06eba%2Fblitzeffect-260215-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31272d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7302x4825+0+23/resize/1680x1110!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Faf%2Fbfbda29a48de8b8a9ee6bac06eba%2Fblitzeffect-260215-08.jpg 2x\" width=\"840\" height=\"555\"\n        src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff1d075/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7302x4825+0+23/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Faf%2Fbfbda29a48de8b8a9ee6bac06eba%2Fblitzeffect-260215-08.jpg\"&gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n                \n            \n        \n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-info\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-infoTitle\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-infoDescription\"&gt;Cecilia Villarruel, owner of Cecy’s Molino de Masa at 8546 S.

\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1986, Cecilia “Cecy” Villarruel has been producing masa in South Chicago. She uses a molino, a machine that grinds up corn, water and other ingredients to make the dough used in Mexican favorites like tamales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of celebrating 40 years in business this year, Villarruel is worrying about her friends, family, employees and the neighborhood overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After ICE and Border Patrol began targeting South Chicago and the adjacent Southeast Side neighborhoods last fall, Villarruel noticed a change, especially around Thanksgiving and Christmas, typically a busy time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was slow. The people were afraid to stand in line,” she says in her native Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her son, Saul Villarruel, who handles the finances for the business, says sales have dramatically decreased since the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even now, “People are terrorized to go out,” Cecy Villarruel says. “I’m not afraid to go, but I’m afraid for my employees.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villarruel, a naturalized American citizen, says one worker didn't want to go out for three or four months, and some of her workers still are afraid to go outside and come to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would deliver food to their homes. A lot of them would send their grandkids, and we would also try to take the products to their home,” Villarruel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saul Villarruel says when workers don’t show up, it’s up to other family members to pick up the slack for the small staff. “It’s still a problem,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a community of African and Latino immigrants, he sees \"people looking over their shoulder,” he says. “Some people are afraid of getting stopped for just being Latino.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though he’s American-born and a citizen, Saul Villarruel worries about his own safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By looking at me, nobody ever assumes that I'm Mexican. In that sense, I'm kind of protected. But I'm not. My parents are literally immigrants. A lot of people I know are from immigrants,” he says. “These are people I've worked with, people I've grown up with, people who have taken care of me. I feel an obligation, a responsibility to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"sc-maria\" name=\"sc-maria\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;South Chicago: Maria &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-640000\" name=\"image-640000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9842379/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4508x2530+0+238/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4b%2F70%2Fd70368c749009b5b028025e6ddfa%2Fblitzeffect-260222-03.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/67b989a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4508x2530+0+238/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4b%2F70%2Fd70368c749009b5b028025e6ddfa%2Fblitzeffect-260222-03.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5761ad8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4508x2530+0+238/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4b%2F70%2Fd70368c749009b5b028025e6ddfa%2Fblitzeffect-260222-03.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Maria stands for a photo in South Chicago, Friday, Feb. 13, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5761ad8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4508x2530+0+238/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4b%2F70%2Fd70368c749009b5b028025e6ddfa%2Fblitzeffect-260222-03.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fd5b5c7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4508x2530+0+238/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4b%2F70%2Fd70368c749009b5b028025e6ddfa%2Fblitzeffect-260222-03.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5761ad8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4508x2530+0+238/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4b%2F70%2Fd70368c749009b5b028025e6ddfa%2Fblitzeffect-260222-03.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria stands for a photo in South Chicago, Friday, Feb. 13, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria, a 46-year-old mother of four, describes a feeling of panic and being trapped in her South Chicago home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She goes to her job at a business in the surrounding area, but her family limits its other activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t go to events. We stopped going to the library, doctor’s appointments. It’s changed our lives 100%,” says Maria, who asked that her last name be withheld because she fears getting deported. “At nighttime, you can’t fall asleep. You’re afraid for them to knock on the door. You don’t know what time of day they are going to come. They could break your windows.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria arrived five years ago from the Mexican border town Reynosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was great. We had a lot of fun. Life was good,” she says in her native Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s changed. Maria says she is scared to go out for groceries and to take her children to school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My 13-year-old daughter is under a lot of stress right now, and her hair is falling out,” she says. \"It's snowed, and we haven't been able to go play in the snow. … They have even had to miss things like football practice, boxing training and other everyday activities they were used to doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria has to talk bluntly to her children so they are prepared for what could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We plan on staying here,\" she says. \"If God allows us to stay here, we’ll stay here, unless they come for us and we’ll have to return to Mexico. We would have to start over, because our lives are here.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"

   \n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining the National Guard seemed like a good idea to a 20-year-old Southeast Side resident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she was born in the United States, her mother and siblings are undocumented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says she joined the Guard hoping to ease the path for her relatives to be naturalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to give them a better future,” she says, asking that she not be identified because she fears reprisals for talking to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threat of President Donald Trump sending the National Guard into Chicago’s streets has diminished since the fall, but it still hangs over Guard members who in some cases would have to patrol their own neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I won't feel good with that at all,” the Southeast Side woman says. “I know if I go and I have to detain people, I will be crying because I can’t control myself. It’s people that came for a better life and better opportunities and give a better future for the kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says all her friends in the guard feel conflicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of the people that I work with are Hispanic,” she says. “They are really sad about the things, and they see how this government is just messed up and everything, but like, there's nothing they really can do about anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"sc-pedraza\" name=\"sc-pedraza\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;South Chicago: Corina Pedraza&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a00000\" name=\"image-a00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2047406/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3366+0+317/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fd1%2F6f83c42547baba7ab9e2f39d00a3%2Feastsideice-101625-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a26e74a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3366+0+317/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fd1%2F6f83c42547baba7ab9e2f39d00a3%2Feastsideice-101625-09.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba058f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3366+0+317/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fd1%2F6f83c42547baba7ab9e2f39d00a3%2Feastsideice-101625-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"EASTSIDEICE-101625-09.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba058f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3366+0+317/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fd1%2F6f83c42547baba7ab9e2f39d00a3%2Feastsideice-101625-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/896441d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3366+0+317/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fd1%2F6f83c42547baba7ab9e2f39d00a3%2Feastsideice-101625-09.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba058f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3366+0+317/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fd1%2F6f83c42547baba7ab9e2f39d00a3%2Feastsideice-101625-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corina Pedraza, member of Southwest and Southeast Rapid Response Team, speaks about federal immigration enforcement incidents in her neighborhoods during a news conference at the United Workers Center at 9805 S.

That all got shattered in October. They found the East Side,” says Pedraza, 51, a member of both the Southwest and Southeast Side Rapid Response teams, community groups that mobilize when residents report sightings of ICE or federal agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the community at large was just shocked to see the level of violence and the aggressive behavior,” she says. “There were teenagers that were slammed to the ground right at the busiest corner of the East Side, 106th and Ewing. They were going after anybody and everybody who has dark skin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Pedraza says people here are living their lives more cautiously. ICE encounters are down, but community members fear a return in March and residents are being cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are still going onto social media and saying, ‘I saw some dark SUVs. I saw an SUV with dark tinted windows. Can someone check?’” Pedraza says. “I don't think that has gone away. I think that people are definitely keeping eyes and ears open, because we know that agents have not left the area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pedraza’s family arrived in South Chicago in the 1960s. Her father taught at several local institutions before opening a small business of his own, and her mother worked long hours at Jay’s Potato Chips. Like many families there, Pedraza says, “They helped build the neighborhood brick by brick, shift by shift.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2024, to win the presidential election, Trump gained ground with Latino voters. Many, even in the Southeast Side and South Chicago area, support him and his policies, Pedraza said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s causing a divide in the community, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s definitely people who feel like 'I'm an American citizen, I have nothing to hide. It’s not a big deal to just show them your ID,'” Pedraza says. “But there are other people who feel that it is a big deal. Why can I not walk in my neighborhood without feeling like I have to prove to someone that I am a citizen? I thought we were living in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"

\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olga Bautista speaks proudly about the Southeast Side, her only home for all her 47 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This community is families from all over the world,” she says. “Eastern European families, Mexican families, people from Latin America. Black sharecroppers from the South came up to work in the steel mills. There’s such a rich mix of cultures here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nestled along Lake Michigan, the area is known for Calumet and Steelworkers parks, where families gather, children play soccer and generations have built memories. Bautista recalls walking to the lake in minutes, attending day camp and later watching her own child train as a lifeguard there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish, where she and her children were baptized, is among the oldest Mexican-American Catholic churches in the Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the sense of safety and community has been shaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have seen a huge drop in people on the streets, shopping in the commercial corridors,” says Bautista, a member of the Chicago Board of Education. “Folks are not going to their doctor's appointments. Children are not going to school. It is definitely impacting the way that we socialize, the way that we are in community with each other. The businesses here are taking a big hit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Coast Guard facility near Calumet Park had felt approachable, with Coast Guard members interacting with families, hosting Halloween trick-or-treating and sitting at picnic tables. Security and fencing increased and it became more “militarized,” Bautista says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and other residents believe the area has been used as a staging ground for immigration enforcement operations. Those operations have had a chilling effect across the neighborhood, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm still getting notices that families have been abducted just this week. They are being kidnapped,\" Bautista says. \"They're not asking for information. They just take these folks. They pull them out of their cars, out of their houses. It's very violent. It's very traumatizing to them and to their families and this whole community — from the stories of how people are being abducted to the visual images on TV.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"sw-progresando\" name=\"sw-progresando\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Southwest Side: Latinos Progresando &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c30000\" name=\"image-c30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9ec74d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4066250/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d737ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Latinos Progresando CEO Luis Gutierrez leads a community resource meeting at Maria Saucedo Scholastic Academy in Little Village in February.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d737ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91950b6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d737ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latinos Progresando CEO Luis Gutierrez leads a community resource meeting at Maria Saucedo Scholastic Academy in Little Village in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latinos Progresando, an organization that supports immigrant communities like Pilsen and Little Village, is dealing with the fallout from Operation Midway Blitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community members want answers, says Luis Gutierrez, who founded the organization 28 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many ask for help navigating the immigration system and locating family members who have been detained. Staff members spend hours trying to determine where detainees are being held. Residents come in worried about their loved one not having their medicine or any means to communicate with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They come in every day looking for help,” says Gutierrez, 53, who spent the holiday season delivering groceries, essential household goods and gifts. He and his staff visited families who were too scared to leave their homes for fear of being detained or deported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work has taken a toll on nonprofit and advocacy workers, he says: “You’re constantly answering phone calls, emails and texts, trying to provide some sort of information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says advocates sounded the alarm early last year, asking for support, especially after they saw what happened in Los Angeles in the summer, but few outside the Latino community initially responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Toward the end of last year, suddenly the city woke up,” Gutierrez says. “You saw people across communities standing up and saying, ‘This isn’t right.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of Mexican immigrants, Gutierrez, who grew up in Little Village, says he knows firsthand about fear and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possible detention by federal immigration officials has caused widespread anxiety and trauma, building a need for mental health services, he says. “Our community really has been in emergency response mode since COVID started, and we have not stopped.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m working with principals and we’re talking about kids walking to school by themselves,” Gutierrez says. “We’re talking about a lack of participation in programs and even in local school councils.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s sad,” he says. “But when I talk to community residents and see [them] navigating the system, talking to their kids, preparing their families, there’s so much strength and beauty in how they stand up during this time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gutierrez says residents believe immigration agents will return, but they feel more prepared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other communities are standing up and protesting, and so we are going to continue the work, and whatever comes, we're going to deal with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#pilsen-top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to

active parent. For years, she’s enrolled her kids in after-school activities and volunteered with a parent support group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My biggest hope is that all my children grow up to be good people and become upstanding members of society,” she says. “It’s up to us as parents to lead them down the right path.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many immigrants from Mexico, Alejandra says she came to the United States 20 years ago looking for a better life and more opportunities for her future children. She and her husband wanted to raise their children in Pilsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, after living through the fall surge of federal immigration enforcement, she is rethinking her community involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she’s tentatively allowed her children — one in high school and two in elementary school — to resume extracurricular activities like soccer and theater club that they had stopped doing in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she says that may change in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are still a little scared. I worry that people who agree with this administration behave badly or aggressively towards our community. I don’t want my kids to see any of that,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alejandra says Pilsen is usually calm and close-knit, but that the sense of safety is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our lives have changed. You can feel it, [our community has] distrust. There are people that only see the color of our skin and identify us as enemies,” she says. “They don’t know how many years we have lived here and how we have been paying taxes and not receiving any benefits. I feel people think we are taking things from them, but that’s not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alejandra says her family knows people who have had encounters with immigration agents, including one family whose father was arrested and detained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This shouldn’t be happening,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says fear has reshaped everything. “People aren’t as chatty as they used to be. You notice people are gone, like the tamale vendor who used to be on the corner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite her fear, she remains optimistic about her children’s future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tell my

GM Ryan Poles and coach Ben Johnson could still find a Day 1 starter on either side of the line at No. 25, Jeremiah said — and don't need to swing a trade to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re in a good spot,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Ozzy Trapilo expected to need until at least midseason to recover from a patellar tendon injury and Braxton Jones about to become a free agent, the Bears are in the market for a starting left tackle, be it via trade, free agency or the draft. The Bears will continue to get a sense of the market when they attend the NFL Scouting Combine next week in Indianapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left tackles who could be available at No. 25 include Clemson’s Blake Miller, Georgia’s Monroe Freeling, Alabama’s Kadyn Proctor and Utah’s Caleb Lomu. Arizona State’s Max Iheanachor could climb up to that spot, too. The 6-5, 325 pounder moved to Los Angeles area from Nigeria in middle school and didn’t play football until junior college. Jeremiah ranked him No. 41 overall before he dominated during Senior Bowl week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s a big, physical dude whose best football is ahead of him,” Jeremiah said. “He could start getting ahead, into that range of the draft as well. Out of that clump, I can’t envision all of them would be gone, so you’re going to get one of those guys that would be able to be plug-and-play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fano and Freeling are ranked No. 19 and 21, respectively, on ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr.’s list of top 25 draftable players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At defensive end, the Bears could eye Miami’s Akheem Mesidor, who will be 25 when the season starts, or Auburn’s Keldric Faulk, who doesn’t turn 21 until September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faulk has an ideal body type and moves smoothly, Jeremiah said, but hasn’t shown the pass-rish production that teams want. Teams are “all over the map” about where he could get picked, Jeremiah said. Mesidor, who was born in Ottawa, has the ability to rush from wide but also from the inside when he moves to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just not fair with him against college guards — he just kills them in there …” Jeremiah said. “This guy never stops. There’s never a breath you can take when you’re trying to block Akheem Mesidor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 6-3, Mesidor might be too short for Dennis Allen’s scheme. The same can be said for Texas A&amp;amp;M’s Cashius Howell, who is 6-2 and, Jeremiah said, has shorter-than-ideal arms. Still, he could run a blazing 40-yard dash next week. Clemson’s T.J. Parker, Oklahoma’s R. Mason Thomas and Missouri’s Zion Young could be available when the Bears pick 25th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah put Clemson defensive tackle Peter Woods on the Bears in his latest mock draft, praising his pass-rush ability. The Bears could turn to a standout safety class with their first pick, too, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re well-positioned for where they area,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only sure thing in this year’s draft appears to be the fact the Raiders will take Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza first overall. Jeremiah said he didn’t grade Mendoza as high as the Bears’ Caleb Williams, Patriots’ Drake Maye or Commanders’ Jayden Daniels when they left college two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He would slot in behind those guys,” he said. “But I think he’s excellent.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Pike House is storybook perfect: a quaint, wood and stone 19th century Tudor Revival home on the edge of a forest preserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its story had been one of neglect in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Forest Preserve District of Cook County owns the home, near 91st Street and Longwood Drive, at the southern tip of 257-acre Dan Ryan Woods. But it lacked the cash keep it in good repair — or even fix up the house when its condition slipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the 132-year-old Beverly landmark might end up happily ever after, as the first phase of stabilization and repairs on the vacant building is likely to begin this spring following a $1.5 million state grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funding was set aside in 2024 but wasn't able to be allocated until last month. That's when the Cook County Board approved a partnership agreement with the recently-created Eugene S. Pike House Foundation and the Beverly Area Arts Alliance that allows the groups to raise money for the home's rehabilitation and ultimately, use the building as the Pike House Community Cultural Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There's a lot of us out here who really care deeply about preserving any historic property that can be preserved,\" Eugene S. Pike House Foundation President Grace Kuikman said. \"But the Pike House — it's just special.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Once upon a time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eugene S. Pike House was built in 1894 as a gardener's cottage on what were then the grounds of Pike's 32-acre estate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pike, a real estate developer who helped downtown rebuild after the Great Chicago Fire of 1872, hired architect Henry Hale Waterman to design the small home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waterman's solution was perfect for the site: a picturesque home with a deep-pitched gable roof, rusticated sandstone base, half-timbering and prominent turret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Institute of Architects Guide to Chicago said the house looks as if one could \"expect Hansel and Gretel to come tripping past.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-220000\" name=\"image-220000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/77b68b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5541x3110+0+485/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe0%2F3d%2F79f533c44987821d7012fdc2cbf8%2Fimg-0922.jpeg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4e30054/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5541x3110+0+485/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe0%2F3d%2F79f533c44987821d7012fdc2cbf8%2Fimg-0922.jpeg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f917bd2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5541x3110+0+485/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe0%2F3d%2F79f533c44987821d7012fdc2cbf8%2Fimg-0922.jpeg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"An early photo of the H.H.

Maher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Pike House, Waterman designed at least 40 other structures in the Beverly and Morgan Park communities from the 1890s to the 1920s, including what was briefly his own home at 10838 S. Longwood Drive, which was built into the glacial ridge along Longwood Drive that marks the two neighborhoods. (A non-Beverly/Morgan Park Waterman design I've always liked is &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/architecture-design/2025/06/19/endangered-washington-park-building-frank-lloyd-wright-rescue\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;South Park Terrace&lt;/a&gt; at 61st and King Drive.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ridge Historical Society Director Tim Blackburn said most of Waterman's Beverly and Morgan Park work sits on or near the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He just built so many houses and really used the ridge and the majestic hill [created by it] to its fullest effect,\" Blackburn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Forest Preserve District bought Pike's estate in 1921, when the agency moved to create Dan Ryan Woods. The home was used as the Forest Preserve District superintendent's office then became the Dan Ryan Woods watchman's house in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d60000\" name=\"image-d60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b44e5b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+172/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2Fbe%2F5defa6e24cbb8287e596ac8d5349%2Fpike-260209-14.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0000987/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+172/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2Fbe%2F5defa6e24cbb8287e596ac8d5349%2Fpike-260209-14.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6f6489c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+172/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2Fbe%2F5defa6e24cbb8287e596ac8d5349%2Fpike-260209-14.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Behind the Eugene S.

Legislation for the grant was sponsored by State Sen. Willie Preston (16th).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Kuikman said repair work will begin in the spring, another $1.5 million or so will be needed down the road to repair the home's interior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The interior is in pretty sad shape,\" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the work is done, the home will be an asset to the area, Beverly Area Arts Alliance President Sal Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group will have discussions with the community about the building's future use, she said. But the organization envisions the home hosting exhibitions, classes and an artist-in-residence program that could feature \"artists from all over the world to stay there and share their art,\" Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We want to draw people to that place,\" she said.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "summary": "<img alt=\"Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson with his wife, Jacqueline, salutes the cheering crowd in Chicago, Wednesday, March 10, 1988. Jackson made environmental justice issues a key part of his campaign.\" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a294e3c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2997x1989+0+0/resize/840x557!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3e%2F01%2F6b1c83bd49c1b8e2b3d7255b69f8%2Fap8803100422-1.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;Peggy Shepard walked into her living room on Tuesday morning when her husband told her Jesse Jackson, the civil rights titan from South Carolina, had died. “Immediately tears started coming,” said Shepard, co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, a New York City-based nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 40 years ago, Jackson had altered the course of Shepard’s life. In the late 1980s, she was working as an editor at Time-Life Books, when a colleague mentioned an organizing meeting for Jackson’s 1988 presidential campaign in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village. “I walked into this Saturday meeting, and I walked out on air,” Shepard recalled. “Two hours later, I'm the press secretary for the Jackson campaign in Manhattan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That campaign — which would prove groundbreaking for Shepard and the country — pushed issues that had rarely been centered in national politics. Jackson made environmental justice, a term Americans were largely unfamiliar with at the time, a key plank of his second presidential run. He called for a national energy policy that would make offshore oil drilling obsolete, a plan to phase out nuclear energy, measures to reduce tailpipe pollution from cars, a conservation strategy to restore the nation's wetlands and forests, and a federally sponsored workforce in the style of the New Deal Civilian Conservation Corps. (The Biden administration launched a similar program, the American Climate Corps, in 2024, but &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://grist.org/politics/american-climate-corps-biden-jobs-program-trump/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;shuttered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it days ahead of President Trump’s return to office last year.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being in the Jesse Jackson campaign led to everything I'm doing right now,” said Shepard of the volunteer job that took her across New York City and exposed her to stark disparities between neighborhoods, especially in pollution burdens. “If I hadn't gone to that Saturday meeting, I'm not sure that I'd be sitting here today in this position.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., transformed American politics with his two historic presidential campaigns, and inspired countless organizers — including environmental justice advocates — along the way. In his later years, he began making connections between segregation in Greenville, South Carolina, where he was born, and the toxic drinking water in Flint, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Inspiring environmental justice advocacy in Chicago&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheryl Johnson, who runs the Chicago-based environmental justice nonprofit People for Community Recovery, was about 10 years old when she first saw Jackson in person. It was a grade-school field trip to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the prominent civil rights nonprofit he founded in 1971, headquartered on the South Side. The towering figure left a lifelong impression on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always remember he would say, ‘up with hope, down with dope,’” she said, recalling Jackson’s stockpile of charismatic appeals. “To see him fighting, at that particular time, for the right to be black in America, was an inspiration for me that I followed for many, many years,” Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2026/02/18/lights-camera-jesse-jackson-civil-rights-leader-pop-culture-presence\"   &gt;Lights, camera, Jackson: Civil Rights leader also became a pop culture presence&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From the television set to magazine covers, Johnson grew up with Jackson in the background. Her mother, Hazel Johnson, founded People for Community Recovery, one of the first environmental justice organizations in the country, and worked with Jackson several times during the Clinton administration. Today Hazel Johnson is remembered as “the mother of the environmental justice movement.” Cheryl Johnson never worked directly with Jackson on environmental issues in Chicago, but the two \"would have discussions on the phone,\" she said. \"He got it.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson was often pragmatic, not allowing environmental concerns to outweigh what he believed Black communities needed. In 2021, he successfully urged Illinois lawmakers to propose legislation making it easier to build a natural gas pipeline to the rural Pembroke Township south of Chicago, once referred to as the largest Black farming community in the Northern U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A secure source of energy would help kickstart other development — and in turn create jobs and generate hope,” Jackson wrote in an op-ed in support of the plan. As of this year, the pipeline is delivering &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.shawlocal.com/daily-journal/2026/01/15/economic-alliance/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;natural gas to over 100 residents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson also took an active interest in the Flint water crisis, showing up repeatedly and lending support. In early 2016, Melissa Mays filed a lawsuit against the city of Flint, Michigan, for exposing nearly 100,000 residents to unsafe water contaminated with lead, a toxic metal linked to developmental delays, cardiovascular issues, and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mays, a longtime Flint resident and a then-emerging clean water activist, remembers sitting in front of cameras and answering questions about her lawsuit when, unexpectedly, Jackson walked through the doors. “He walks right up to us to ask if he can say something,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after, Jackson declared that officials should put “tape around the city, because Flint is a crime scene.\" Mays said the moment validated her concerns and in part kicked off a longtime friendship between the two. Jackson returned to Flint repeatedly, helping turn the water crisis into national news and criticizing the Obama administration for not sufficiently responding to the crisis. He made his last public appearance in Flint in 2024 to visit the Flint Southwestern Classical Academy to highlight the importance of voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was not afraid of anybody,” Mays said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/17/what-we-know-rev-jesse-jacksons-death-services\"   &gt;What we know about Rev.

      "summary": "<img alt=\"Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson with his wife, Jacqueline, salutes the cheering crowd in Chicago, Wednesday, March 10, 1988. Jackson made environmental justice issues a key part of his campaign.\" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a294e3c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2997x1989+0+0/resize/840x557!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3e%2F01%2F6b1c83bd49c1b8e2b3d7255b69f8%2Fap8803100422-1.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;Peggy Shepard walked into her living room on Tuesday morning when her husband told her Jesse Jackson, the civil rights titan from South Carolina, had died. “Immediately tears started coming,” said Shepard, co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, a New York City-based nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 40 years ago, Jackson had altered the course of Shepard’s life. In the late 1980s, she was working as an editor at Time-Life Books, when a colleague mentioned an organizing meeting for Jackson’s 1988 presidential campaign in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village. “I walked into this Saturday meeting, and I walked out on air,” Shepard recalled. “Two hours later, I'm the press secretary for the Jackson campaign in Manhattan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That campaign — which would prove groundbreaking for Shepard and the country — pushed issues that had rarely been centered in national politics. Jackson made environmental justice, a term Americans were largely unfamiliar with at the time, a key plank of his second presidential run. He called for a national energy policy that would make offshore oil drilling obsolete, a plan to phase out nuclear energy, measures to reduce tailpipe pollution from cars, a conservation strategy to restore the nation's wetlands and forests, and a federally sponsored workforce in the style of the New Deal Civilian Conservation Corps. (The Biden administration launched a similar program, the American Climate Corps, in 2024, but &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://grist.org/politics/american-climate-corps-biden-jobs-program-trump/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;shuttered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it days ahead of President Trump’s return to office last year.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being in the Jesse Jackson campaign led to everything I'm doing right now,” said Shepard of the volunteer job that took her across New York City and exposed her to stark disparities between neighborhoods, especially in pollution burdens. “If I hadn't gone to that Saturday meeting, I'm not sure that I'd be sitting here today in this position.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., transformed American politics with his two historic presidential campaigns, and inspired countless organizers — including environmental justice advocates — along the way. In his later years, he began making connections between segregation in Greenville, South Carolina, where he was born, and the toxic drinking water in Flint, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Inspiring environmental justice advocacy in Chicago&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheryl Johnson, who runs the Chicago-based environmental justice nonprofit People for Community Recovery, was about 10 years old when she first saw Jackson in person. It was a grade-school field trip to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the prominent civil rights nonprofit he founded in 1971, headquartered on the South Side. The towering figure left a lifelong impression on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always remember he would say, ‘up with hope, down with dope,’” she said, recalling Jackson’s stockpile of charismatic appeals. “To see him fighting, at that particular time, for the right to be black in America, was an inspiration for me that I followed for many, many years,” Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2026/02/18/lights-camera-jesse-jackson-civil-rights-leader-pop-culture-presence\"   &gt;Lights, camera, Jackson: Civil Rights leader also became a pop culture presence&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From the television set to magazine covers, Johnson grew up with Jackson in the background. Her mother, Hazel Johnson, founded People for Community Recovery, one of the first environmental justice organizations in the country, and worked with Jackson several times during the Clinton administration. Today Hazel Johnson is remembered as “the mother of the environmental justice movement.” Cheryl Johnson never worked directly with Jackson on environmental issues in Chicago, but the two \"would have discussions on the phone,\" she said. \"He got it.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson was often pragmatic, not allowing environmental concerns to outweigh what he believed Black communities needed. In 2021, he successfully urged Illinois lawmakers to propose legislation making it easier to build a natural gas pipeline to the rural Pembroke Township south of Chicago, once referred to as the largest Black farming community in the Northern U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A secure source of energy would help kickstart other development — and in turn create jobs and generate hope,” Jackson wrote in an op-ed in support of the plan. As of this year, the pipeline is delivering &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.shawlocal.com/daily-journal/2026/01/15/economic-alliance/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;natural gas to over 100 residents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson also took an active interest in the Flint water crisis, showing up repeatedly and lending support. In early 2016, Melissa Mays filed a lawsuit against the city of Flint, Michigan, for exposing nearly 100,000 residents to unsafe water contaminated with lead, a toxic metal linked to developmental delays, cardiovascular issues, and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mays, a longtime Flint resident and a then-emerging clean water activist, remembers sitting in front of cameras and answering questions about her lawsuit when, unexpectedly, Jackson walked through the doors. “He walks right up to us to ask if he can say something,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after, Jackson declared that officials should put “tape around the city, because Flint is a crime scene.\" Mays said the moment validated her concerns and in part kicked off a longtime friendship between the two. Jackson returned to Flint repeatedly, helping turn the water crisis into national news and criticizing the Obama administration for not sufficiently responding to the crisis. He made his last public appearance in Flint in 2024 to visit the Flint Southwestern Classical Academy to highlight the importance of voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was not afraid of anybody,” Mays said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/17/what-we-know-rev-jesse-jacksons-death-services\"   &gt;What we know about Rev.

Woo was still adjusting to his role on the team during last season's run to the 3A title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I didn’t feel like I played at my best in the state finals, but I did help contribute to our win and the guys stepped up,\" Woo said. \"It was a collective.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woo was learning how to succeed while being the focal point of the opposition defense. He's fully mastered that now and is ready to lead the Rams through the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-4c0000\" name=\"image-4c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9ec324/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2Fb9%2Ffcc705d44525809f6c73e76e8d18%2Fob-cst-010126-8061.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/41c789c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2Fb9%2Ffcc705d44525809f6c73e76e8d18%2Fob-cst-010126-8061.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31fb6c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2Fb9%2Ffcc705d44525809f6c73e76e8d18%2Fob-cst-010126-8061.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"DePaul Prep&amp;#x27;s Rykan Woo controls the ball as the Rams play Benet at the Pontiac Holiday Tournament.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31fb6c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2Fb9%2Ffcc705d44525809f6c73e76e8d18%2Fob-cst-010126-8061.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3d3999c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2Fb9%2Ffcc705d44525809f6c73e76e8d18%2Fob-cst-010126-8061.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31fb6c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2Fb9%2Ffcc705d44525809f6c73e76e8d18%2Fob-cst-010126-8061.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePaul Prep’s Rykan Woo controls the ball as the Rams play Benet at the Pontiac Holiday Tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porter was born on the West Side and lived there before moving to Hillside in third grade.

He's developed into the best shooter in the city, posting multiple games of more than 30 points efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t say enough about his talent,” Marist coach Brian Hynes said. “And the whole school loves him.

But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful,” Kavanaugh wrote in the dissent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision doesn’t stop Trump from imposing duties under other laws. While those have more limitations on the speed and severity of Trump’s actions, top administration officials have said they expect to keep the tariff framework in place under other authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump set what he called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on most countries in April 2025 to address trade deficits that he declared a national emergency. Those came after he imposed duties on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2025/03/05/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-illinois-businesses-facing-scary-times\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Canada, China and Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, ostensibly to address a drug trafficking emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of lawsuits followed, including a case from a dozen largely Democratic-leaning states that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/04/23/dozen-states-sue-trump-administration-to-stop-tariff-policy\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;included Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and others from small businesses. The challengers argued the emergency powers law doesn’t even mention tariffs and Trump's use of it fails several legal tests, including one that doomed then-President Joe Biden's $500 billion student loan forgiveness program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court heard combined cases brought by the small businesses, including &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2025/09/11/supreme-court-president-donald-trump-tariffs-learning-resources-toys\"   &gt;Learning Resources and Hand2Mind&lt;/a&gt;, toy makers based in Vernon Hills that are owned by the same family. Learning Resources filed its lawsuit last year, as did a group of other small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As family-owned, mission-driven education companies, we brought this lawsuit to protect our 500+ employees and the schools and families who rely on us,\" Learning Resources said in a statement. The Supreme Court’s decision, declaring tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as unlawful, “is a powerful reaffirmation of the Rule of Law and Constitutional Separation of Powers that our country is built upon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We Pay the Tariffs, a national grassroots coalition of more than 800 small businesses, demanded automatic refunds to businesses that paid tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’ve taken out loans just to keep their doors open. They've frozen hiring, canceled expansion plans and watched their life savings drain away to pay tariff bills that weren't in any budget or business plan. Today, the Supreme Court has validated what we've been saying all along: these tariffs were unlawful from the start,” We Pay the Tariffs Executive Director Dan Anthony said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Kezios, owner of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2025/11/28/shoppers-wicker-park-sales-small-business-saturday\"   &gt;Mojo Spa&lt;/a&gt; in Wicker Park and a We Pay the Tariffs member, said in a statement: “If tariffs were refunded quickly and reliably, my suppliers could lower ingredient and packaging costs. Restoring these products would immediately help close the revenue gap created during the months we were forced to discontinue more than 50% of our line due to tariff-related cost increases. That revenue is critical for sustaining the business through slower seasons and gives us a real chance to survive and stabilize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are concerns about the lack of a refund system and that the Trump administration will find another way to impose additional duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Small businesses are rightfully worried that the administration will respond to this legal defeat by simply reimposing the same tariff policy through other means,” Anthony said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court ruling comes despite a series of short-term wins on the court’s emergency docket that have allowed Trump to push ahead with extraordinary flexes of executive power on issues ranging from high-profile firings to major federal funding cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican president has been vocal about the case, calling it one of the most important in U.S. history and saying a ruling against him would be an economic body blow to the country. But legal opposition crossed the political spectrum, including libertarian and pro-business groups that are typically aligned with the GOP. Polling has found tariffs aren't broadly popular with the public, amid wider voter concern about affordability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Constitution gives Congress the power to levy tariffs. But the Trump administration argued that a 1977 law allowing the president to regulate importation during emergencies also allows him to set tariffs. Other presidents have used the law dozens of times, often to impose sanctions, but Trump was the first president to invoke it for import taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic impact of Trump's tariffs has been estimated at some $3 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury has collected more than $133 billion from the import taxes the president has imposed under the emergency powers law, federal data from December shows. Many companies, including the big-box warehouse chain Costco, have already lined up in court to demand refunds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah Wilson, owner of The Dropped Stitch near Edgewater, said tariffs have raised costs and created stress and uncertainty for her yarn store. For example, costs have spiked for Wilson’s favorite knitting needle brand from a Michigan company that are considered the best on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of their production is done in China. Since I opened my store in November 2024, their wholesale prices have all increased by 20%-30%, due to the tariff situation,” Wilson said. “A complete set of needles that used to be $214.50 is now $271. Other brands are also increasing their prices, so simply switching to another supplier wouldn't help me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/economy/2025/10/03/chicago-ethnic-international-grocery-stores-produce-prices-tariffs-imports\"   &gt;Chicago’s ethnic grocery stores struggle to keep prices down and import goods&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/illinois-governor/2025/07/14/trump-tariffs-jb-pritzker-illinois-executive-order\"   &gt;Pritzker orders state agencies to assess potential effects of more Trump tariffs&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Funt remembers zero on-campus sports-betting chatter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minnick bottomed out on Nov. 12, 2022, during a 12-hour casino binge in which he maxed out several credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A family that once enjoyed comic Kevin Hart now despises him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s constantly in those ads,” Jennie Minnick, Rob’s mother, told Funt. “So now we hate [Hart].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s all in Funt’s new book, “Everybody Loses,” in which he shines a spotlight on the many ills of a legal industry that might have moved way too fast in blanketing the country since being given a green light in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time I see Hart, LeBron James, Wayne Gretzky, Shaquille O’Neal, Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm and others promoting a sportsbook, I ponder their liability in leading people like Minnick astray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funt gave that cloudy issue clarity because those personalities have normalized this business, made it mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Especially for young people,” Funt said, “seeing their heroes tell them, not just that this is OK but a way to win money when that obviously is so far from the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key issues&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danny’s surname should ring a comedic bell or two. Allen, his grandfather, began a hidden microphone radio show in 1947 that transferred well to television, as ‘‘Candid Camera,’’ a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His son Peter, Danny’s father, continued it. In some form, ‘‘Candid Camera’’ aired on the small screen through 2014. A revival, Danny says, is in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danny, 34, explored plenty of tragedy, sorrow and duplicity in his 312-page maiden effort as an author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Georgetown, he graduated from Columbia with a master’s degree in journalism in 2015. Since 2021, he has contributed sports-betting features to the Washington Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more he dug, the more questions he compiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two were most compelling. First, how, when and why did leagues change their tune on gambling? Not so long ago, the NFL barred Las Vegas from advertising during its precious Super Bowl broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there’s a spiffy domed stadium, not far from the Strip, that houses the Raiders and already has staged a Super Bowl. NFL-themed slot machines occupy casino floors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From saying it was such an evil to embracing it as enthusiastically as possible, I felt like we hadn’t gotten to the bottom of what exactly persuaded them to do a 180,” Funt said. “They weren’t offering answers that were satisfying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, he says, industry leaders Draft-Kings and FanDuel are rather closed-off entities. “I wanted to take time to cultivate sources at those companies,” he said. “I wanted to learn what it’s like to work at one of those places, how the online business operates and to hear how they think of customers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will spoil nothing. Funt delivers with a deep excavation that demands attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shameful&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, have legal sports betting. In four jurisdictions, the minimum age is only 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funt pressed a lobbyist, part of a law firm that has been influential in the national legalization movement, for details of how those moving parts work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In seeking all you wanted in Virginia, Funt asked her, what was one area that received the most pushback, the stickiest request?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She thought for a minute,” Funt said, “then finally said, ‘Uh, yeah, nothing comes to mind. We really got everything we wanted.’ When [regulators] don’t understand [sports gambling], it gives the industry so much leverage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such astounding ignorance and lack of guardrails allow a tout to charge customers for game picks and earn a percentage of their losses, via deals with affiliated companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So slimy,” Funt said. “Naive and gullible clientele being preyed on by those guys is just sad, just so wrong and shameful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are his views, too, on the voracious Euro “ban or bankrupt” model that has so effectively crossed the pond to pollute the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funt includes a profound episode in the late NFLer Junior Seau’s life, which he called a sports horror story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We just forget about them so quickly,” Funt said. “Hopefully, people can learn from what he went through, and the fact that CTE [chronic traumatic encephalopathy] and gambling problems have some overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s pretty scary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meager resistance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1971, cigarette ads were banned from TV. In the last 90 seconds before it began, ad wiz Jack Landry concocted a Marlboro ad featuring four cowboys riding into the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When, I ask Funt, might commercials for sports-betting companies meet a similar fate, Hamm, Foxx, Shaq (on a Clydesdale) and Hart (atop a Shetland pony) galloping away into a dusky desert?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would take something really tragic to get there,” Funt said. “A major match-fixing scandal or a clear surge in suicides due to gambling issues or an enraged gambler tries to kill an athlete because he cost him a bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any of that would be so scandalous, but the money pushing what the industry wants is so lopsided. And the resistance to that is pretty meager. I’m skeptical.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

I was an Obama volunteer attending the party and broadcast of Barack Obama's speech at the Hyatt. Jesse Jackson was in the bleachers behind me doing live shots with reporters. After the cameras were locked on Barack, I noticed Jesse alone and holding an Obama sign. His mind and heart were elsewhere — perhaps pondering what 'could have been' for himself or one of his children. It was the tenderest moment of a politician, activist, human that I've seen up close and personal.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;— Doreen Rice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"My husband and his friends frequented the Division Street Baths in the '70s thru the '90s. It was always a special occasion when 'The Reverend' and his entourage came into the steam room. Mr Jackson, like any good politician, would shake hands and introduce himself to everyone sitting on the tiled tiers. His charisma was contagious.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;— Sandy Doyle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I had the honor to know and do some work with him, appearing on his radio show ... and assisting his organizations where I could. I have spent most of my life defending people facing the death penalty, work which Rev. Jackson supported. My memory is not just [his] amazing work. ... It's of him sitting quietly with me at a table at the Illinois Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers dinner honoring his son, former Congressman Jackson. It's of him taking the time to speak with my then-teenage son, of his kind inquiries regarding my late husband's health, and his concern for humanity in general.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;— Andrea Lyon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"As a Northwestern University undergraduate, I marched with Jesse Jackson in the streets of Chicago for civil rights. In 1968, we were tear-gassed by Richard J. Daley's cops — illegally. I also marched with him in anti-Vietnam War marches.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;— Harvey J. Graff&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We went to a campaign rally in Iowa in 1988 and shook hands with Rev. Jackson. I will always remember how big his hands were!

Maybe you found the words within a giant heart painted inside an abandoned, run-down building you decided to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pilsen artist known as Boots, whose real name is Kimberly Brown, has painted thousands of her original poetry snippets on sidewalks and elsewhere around Chicago since she began sharing her words with the world just before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you can find her painted poetry while walking through towns in all 50 states, part of a project that Brown says has “become bigger than me at this point.” All of them are tagged &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.instagram.com/poetrybyboots\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;@poetrybyboots&lt;/a&gt;, which is her Instagram handle. The biggest number by far are in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s always extra special when my hometown appreciates it,” says Brown, who receives tags, photos and messages nearly every day from fans who found her work. “It still blows my mind how many messages I’ll get.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she has painted thousands of lines over the past eight years, there are some that resonate with a wider audience to which she frequently returns. Those include phrases like “Invest love in the ones who stay,” “We’re all damaged. It’s how we still love with a broken heart that matters” and “don’t give anyone the power to question who you are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown was featured on Good Morning America and other publications in 2022 while the country was in pandemic lockdown. Soon after that, she started selling shirts, bags and prints with her poetry stanzas on them in assorted fonts and graphics. Now, eight years after she began sharing her words, the Oak Lawn native said the hardest part is keeping the balance between staying true to her writing and ignoring the voice asking what might look good on the sidewalk or a hoodie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past five years “has been a whirlwind,” she says. However, “the response has been beautiful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown began sharing her sidewalk poetry while living in Los Angeles after finishing her studies at Chicago's Columbia College. She pulled lines from the poetry that she began writing when she was 12 or 13, she says, and cut her own stencils with her words. She ventured into abandoned buildings and painted them on the walls, encased in big hearts. She moved back to Chicago in 2020, and continued her work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While fans would hold scavenger hunts to find her writing, Brown realized she wanted to share it with more than just those who enjoy exploring abandoned buildings. So she turned to the streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Brown meticulously researches each city she visits, figuring out the best places to add her word art. She might use different color paint in different towns, or different phrases in different neighborhoods. When she visits a new city she might add hundreds of poetry verses before she leaves, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She usually spray paints overnight and doesn’t plan to stop anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I live and breathe it,” she says. “It’s amazing how little sleep I can live on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-d00000\" name=\"module-d00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Murals and Mosaics Newsletter&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-990000\" name=\"html-embed-module-990000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"piano-sidebar-newsletter-murals-and-mosaics\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-b20000\" name=\"module-b20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Chicago’s murals and mosaics sidebar&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/murals-mosaics\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Chicago’s murals &amp;amp; mosaics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Part of a series on public art in the city and suburbs. &lt;b&gt;Know of a mural or mosaic?

Very little.&lt;br&gt;Concerning, but not unfixable with 26 games left in the regular season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tanking stuff is new for the Bulls, at least the soft, purposeful type, so some grace needs to be afforded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But first things first, and the idea that the organization is somehow going to be helped in the process is absolutely ludicrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of Friday afternoon, of the eight teams below the Bulls, only Washington has a winning streak and that’s one game thanks to a victory over a tanking Indiana team. Just take a look at the masterclass of losing going on in the league’s basement properties. The Bulls have lost seven straight and are amateur hour compared to the 15 straight by Sacramento and nine-game cooler that Dallas was on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any idea that the Bulls front office might have of still trying to be competitive and at the same time gain lottery odds needs to be checked at the door and thrown in the nearest dumpster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They don’t go hand-in-hand most years, and definitely not this season because of a loaded 2026 draft class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other realization that the Bulls need to start embracing is Jaden Ivey – the basketball player, not the person – could be damaged goods, closer to being out of the league than the spokesman for a feel-good comeback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s becoming very obvious, and maybe was known all too well by the Pistons, is this is not the same explosive player that was selected No. 5 overall in the 2022 draft out of Purdue, and looked like a star in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since suffering a broken left fibula last Jan. 1, Ivey’s drop-off is head shaking. In his first 30 games pre-injury last season he was just under 30 minutes a game, filling it up with 17.6 points per contest and shooting just under 41% from three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his return to play this season, Detroit was giving him 17 minutes per game, he was averaging 8.2 points and shooting 37% from three with obvious drops in his play-making and explosiveness. In his first four games with the Bulls, he was back to almost 29 minutes per but averaging just 11.5 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe the injury needed more than eight months of recovery. Maybe Ivey will get it back by next season. His comments after he didn’t even see the floor against Toronto on Thursday, however, were ominous when he told reporters, “I’ve been dealing with knee soreness in my knee. I’m sure people can call it out – I’m not the same player I used to be. That’s why. I’m not the J.I. I used to be. The old J.I. is dead.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was alive and well on Friday, just not at practice so he could get his knee looked at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What needs to be understood about the 6-foot-3 guard is he is as religious a basketball player as there might be in the league. He makes that very evident in every interview. Basketball doesn’t dictate his life and is not his main calling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls need to be prepared for that, especially with Ivey a restricted free agent this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the front office also needs to be prepared for? Rebuilds are not easy. There are more painful moments than good ones. Thursday was just the latest reminder of that.&lt;/p&gt;",

Se alegan que estos problemas violan las leyes estatales de derechos humanos y civiles y constituyen molestias tanto públicas como privadas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estos fracasos han producido daños profundos y desproporcionados para los residentes de vecindarios predominantemente negros e hispanos”, dice la demanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-2f0000\" name=\"module-2f0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;El documento sigue a una investigación de dos años realizada por HOPE que encontró que las tasas y la duración de vacantes, el mantenimiento exterior y las deficiencias físicas en propiedades de la CHA eran peores en vecindarios negros y latinos en comparación con comunidades mayoritariamente blancas. Estas condiciones llevaron a la deterioración de las unidades y contribuyeron a la desestabilización del vecindario, encontró la investigación.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La autoridad de vivienda tiene 2,800 unidades dispersas, con más de 450 vacías. De esas unidades vacías, aproximadamente el 78% se encuentran en comunidades de color, dijo la demanda. La CHA es el mayor propietario de vivienda en alquiler en la ciudad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Las unidades dispersas son edificios de apartamentos pequeños a medianos y casas unifamiliares. En 2023, la agencia anunció un impulso para renovar su &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/11/27/23975023/cha-property-renovation-restore-home-program-tracey-scott-scattered-sites\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;cartera de sitios dispersos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En 2023, el Proyecto Illinois Answers y Block Club Chicago publicaron una &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/11/29/as-city-battles-housing-shortage-cha-lets-hundreds-of-empty-homes-decay/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;investigación&lt;/a&gt; sobre los problemas crónicos de vacantes de la CHA en las unidades dispersas. La oficina del inspector general de la CHA también informó en los últimos años sobre el mantenimiento inapropiado de las propiedades, incluida su falta de cumplimiento con la ordenanza de edificios vacíos de la ciudad al no registrar, asegurar y mantener las propiedades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estas propiedades deben ser mantenidas a un estándar digno de las comunidades en las que existen y ese estándar sigue aplicándose cuando esas comunidades son negras y latinas”, dijo Josefina Navar, directora adjunta del Centro de Vivienda Justa HOPE, en un comunicado de prensa el miércoles. “Cada día que una unidad permanece abandonada o en mal estado es un gran perjuicio tanto para estas comunidades como para las miles de familias en las listas de espera por vivienda”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los números de la lista de espera de la CHA son miles para sus programas de vivienda, con algunos solicitantes esperando hasta décadas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew Aguilar, portavoz de la CHA, dijo que la agencia no ha sido formalmente notificada de la demanda y no puede comentar sobre litigios pendientes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Amatore, director ejecutivo de Manage Chicago, dijo en un comunicado que muchos de los incidentes mencionados en la demanda son anteriores a la participación de su compañía. La firma de administración de propiedades asumió el control en julio de 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Desde que asumimos la responsabilidad, hemos operado dentro del alcance de nuestra autoridad contractual con la CHA con respecto a temas de mantenimiento y seguridad”, dijo Amatore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Se negó a comentar más, citando el litigio pendiente.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hispanic Housing Development declinó hacer comentarios y dijo que no ha sido formalmente notificado de la demanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caroline Bermúdez, residente de Humboldt Park y demandante, ha vivido junto a una propiedad de la CHA en 849 N. St. Louis Ave., que ha estado vacía durante casi una década, según la demanda. La casa unifamiliar fue administrada anteriormente por Hispanic Housing y ahora es operada por Manage Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bermúdez experimentó “actividades disruptivas persistentes, encontró parafernalia de drogas usadas en su patio y soportó incidentes repetidos que hicieron que su entorno hogareño fuera inhabitable e inseguro”, según la demanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Las condiciones de la propiedad, descritas como una “casa de almacenaje con actividad significativa de narcóticos”, llevaron a ella y su pareja a reubicarse temporalmente con familiares durante más de un año, debido a preocupaciones de seguridad. Mientras estaban fuera, personas entraron a su casa y dejaron un vehículo robado con un arma de fuego cargada dentro de su garaje, según la demanda. Ahora ha vuelto a su casa, a pesar de los continuos problemas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Llevó su queja a HOPE, lo que impulsó su investigación. Bermúdez y sus vecinos informaron sobre los problemas a agencias de la ciudad, a la policía y a la CHA, según la demanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estoy enojada porque tuve que mudarme de la casa porque la Municipalidad y la CHA se han negado a hacer algo”, dijo Bermúdez al Sun-Times. “Es un fracaso sistémico en múltiples niveles”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En cuanto a la demanda, Bermúdez espera que la CHA haga que la casa de al lado sea habitable para una familia en necesidad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hago un llamadoa los funcionarios de la Municipalidad —al Concejo Municipal y al alcalde— para que finalmente responsabilicen a la CHA por sus prácticas negligentes”, dijo Bermúdez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La oficina del alcalde no respondió de inmediato a una solicitud de comentarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La nueva demanda por discriminación es un agravio para la CHA, mientras intenta abordar una &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2026/02/11/cha-hud-federal-disability-civil-rights-laws-ada-whistleblower-complaint\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;denuncia de un informante&lt;/a&gt; reciente que alega disfunción en el proceso de acomodaciones razonables de la agencia para residentes con discapacidades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los registros muestran que la CHA violó las leyes federales de discapacidad y los derechos civiles de los residentes durante al menos ocho años, lo que llevó a negociaciones para un acuerdo de cumplimiento voluntario entre la CHA y el Departamento de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano federal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Madigan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero el ejecutivo del servicio de utilidades todavía percibió el peligro moral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sabía que complacer a un político poderoso contratando a sus aliados para trabajos en los que no hacían nada estaba mal, dijo un fiscal el jueves. Así que en enero de 2019, cuando el Buró Federal de Investigaciones (FBI) le dio a Márquez la oportunidad de corregir las cosas, la aceptó y grabó conversaciones &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/3/30/23663522/key-federal-witness-comed-bribery-trial-pays-a-price-defense-grills-his-decision-his-personal-life\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;contra sus amigos y colegas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-340000\" name=\"module-340000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esa decisión también le evitó cumplir tiempo en prisión. La juez del distrito Mary Rowland acordó el jueves darle a Márquez sólo dos años de libertad condicional y una multa de $50,000 por su papel en el esquema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero primero, dejó claro una cosa: “Necesitamos personas como tú que alcen su voz más pronto”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Si no podemos tener a ComEd enfrentándose a estas cosas, estamos perdidos”, dijo Rowland. “Estamos en verdaderos problemas si no hay entidades poderosas diciendo ‘suficiente’ a políticos corruptos e irrazonables”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La sentencia de Márquez, que duró 75 minutos y fue discreta, pareció finalmente cerrar el capítulo —al menos en las cortes inferiores— sobre la impactante investigación de corrupción que desestabilizó la política de Chicago y llevó a condenas de prisión &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/06/13/mike-madigan-sentencing-hearing\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;para Madigan&lt;/a&gt; y &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024/06/24/ed-burke-trial-alderman-edward-m-burke-news-verdict-sentence-final\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;el ex concejal de Chicago, Edward M. Burke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sin embargo, hubo poca suspenso, ya que los fiscales habían acordado en 2020 solicitar libertad condicional si Márquez continuaba cooperando. El principal punto de controversia en la audiencia del jueves giró en torno a si Márquez debería pagar una multa tan alta como $250,000, y si se le debería ordenar realizar 320 horas de servicio comunitario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al final, Rowland ordenó a Márquez pagar una fracción de la multa solicitada por los fiscales. También le evitó cualquier servicio comunitario ordenado por la corte. Christopher Niewoehner, su abogado defensor, dijo que Márquez ya había pasado “al menos” 336 horas en 2025 ayudando a estudiantes en el Pima Community College de Arizona, donde reside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a66d84\" name=\"image-a66d84\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/83ad2fb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4315x2422+0+228/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2Fba%2Ffeb8da074321b14665c95a8e63c8%2Fmarquezsentencing-260220-001.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e75658c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4315x2422+0+228/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2Fba%2Ffeb8da074321b14665c95a8e63c8%2Fmarquezsentencing-260220-001.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72f0a30/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4315x2422+0+228/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2Fba%2Ffeb8da074321b14665c95a8e63c8%2Fmarquezsentencing-260220-001.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"MARQUEZSENTENCING_260220-001.JPG\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72f0a30/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4315x2422+0+228/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2Fba%2Ffeb8da074321b14665c95a8e63c8%2Fmarquezsentencing-260220-001.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/615143d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4315x2422+0+228/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2Fba%2Ffeb8da074321b14665c95a8e63c8%2Fmarquezsentencing-260220-001.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72f0a30/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4315x2422+0+228/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F30%2Fba%2Ffeb8da074321b14665c95a8e63c8%2Fmarquezsentencing-260220-001.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fidel Márquez en la Corte Federal Dirksen para la sentencia el 19 de febrero de 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers / Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lamento sinceramente mis acciones y participación en el soborno a Michael Madigan”, le dijo Márquez al juez antes de que éste dictara la sentencia. “Me da vergüenza”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El empleado de ComEd de muchos años ascendió en 2012 para convertirse en el vicepresidente principal de asuntos gubernamentales del servicio de electricidad antes de que su carrera terminara en medio de la investigación sobre Madigan en 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Su ligera sentencia llegó después de que Márquez testificara en dos juicios contra cinco personas que ahora están en prisión federal: Madigan, los ex cabilderos de ComEd &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-corruption-trials/2025/07/24/madigans-political-fixer-gets-2-year-prison-sentence\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Michael McClain&lt;/a&gt;

Cuando el FBI enfrentó a Márquez en la casa de su madre en Hammond, Indiana, el 16 de enero de 2019, él “tomó una decisión inmediata de ayudar porque pensó que era lo correcto”, dijo Niewoehner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Era una oportunidad para él para detener algo que pensaba que estaba mal”, dijo el abogado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Márquez reunió gran parte de la evidencia más crucial de los federales sin la asistencia de un abogado, escribió Niewoehner en un reciente memorando judicial.  El abogado dijo que Márquez no buscó asesoría legal hasta después de mayo de 2019, una vez que había grabado en secreto a McClain, Pramaggiore, Hooker y Doherty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Márquez testificó durante el juicio de Madigan que &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/madigan-trial-news/2024/11/05/former-comed-exec-wore-wire-takes-stand-michael-madigan-trial\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;ComEd canalizó dinero a los aliados de Madigan&lt;/a&gt; durante varios años como un “favor” para que Madigan estuviera “más predispuesto positivamente hacia la agenda legislativa de ComEd”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El juicio de Madigan terminó en febrero de 2025, con los jurados de acuerdo en que el ex presidente conspiró para hacer que funcionarios de ComEd pagaran $1.3 millones a sus aliados como parte del esquema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McClain, Pramaggiore, Hooker y Doherty &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2023/5/2/23697452/jurors-reach-verdict-in-comed-bribery-trial\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;fueron condenados por un jurado separado&lt;/a&gt; en mayo de 2023 por sus papeles en la trama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El juez del distrito John Blakey sentenció a Madigan el verano pasado a 7 años y medio de prisión. El ex poderoso demócrata está cumpliendo su sentencia en Virginia Occidental. Sin embargo, está impugnando su condena, y la Corte de Apelaciones del Séptimo Circuito tiene programado escuchar los argumentos en su caso el 9 de abril.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La juez de distrito Manish Shah les impuso sentencias de prisión de dos años a McClain y Pramaggiore. Les dio a Hooker 18 meses y a Doherty un año.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McClain y Pramaggiore también están buscando apelar y los argumentos en su caso están programados para el 14 de abril.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Este protocolo establece pautas claras y legalmente sólidas para garantizar que tengamos un camino responsable y efectivo para buscar responsabilidad”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-ba0000\" name=\"module-ba0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Según las directrices, las agencias de aplicación de la ley dirigirán las investigaciones criminales recolectando y preservando evidencias. Si las autoridades necesitan asistencia para obtener testimonios jurados o evidencias adicionales que no se ofrezcan de manera voluntaria, la oficina de la fiscal estatal puede intervenir y constituir un gran jurado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los fiscales llevarán a cabo una revisión independiente de todas las evidencias y tomarán decisiones sobre las acusaciones, tal como lo hacen en todos los casos de delitos graves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sin embargo, en estos casos, la oficina de O’Neill Burke también tendrá que considerar las protecciones específicas que se ofrecen a los agentes federales en servicio, lo que demuestra que el oficial no tiene inmunidad bajo la Cláusula de Supremacía. Esto protege a los oficiales federales de la prosecución estatal mientras actúan en su capacidad oficial, siempre que “no hicieran más de lo necesario y correcto”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El protocolo para presentar cargos, desarrollado en colaboración con el fiscal general de Illinois, Kwame Raoul, y la Asociación de Fiscales del Estado de Illinois, fue elogiado por el alcalde Johnson, cuyo decreto ejecutivo “ICE sobre aviso” recibió fuertes críticas de la oficina de O’Neill Burke a principios de este mes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La objeción se basaba en la decisión de Johnson de ordenar a la Policía de Chicago que hiciera referencias penales a los fiscales “bajo la dirección de la Oficina del Alcalde”. La oficina de O’Neill Burke calificó la orden de “totalmente inapropiada”, diciendo que &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/06/eileen-oneill-burke-brandon-johnson-immigration-ice-law\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;plantea problemas de interferencia política&lt;/a&gt; que podrían poner en peligro los casos criminales. Pero el jueves, Johnson emitió un comunicado diciendo que su orden y las nuevas directrices de O’Neill Burke son “aspectos alineados del mismo marco de seguridad pública”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“El Protocolo de la Fiscal Estatal establece el proceso de enjuiciamiento que sigue a esas referencias, asegurando que los casos sean evaluados bajo los mismos estándares legales que se aplican a cualquier otra persona”, destacó Johnson. “Juntos, refuerzan un principio simple: los agentes federales que operan en Chicago siguen sujetos a la ley, y cuando ocurren incidentes graves, debe haber un camino claro y coordinado hacia la responsabilidad”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-fbccfd\" name=\"image-fbccfd\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2fbf3fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6041x3390+0+318/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2F0d%2F4532124df4d3ada2b0471abb0034%2Fshoot-110123-7.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f854eab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6041x3390+0+318/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2F0d%2F4532124df4d3ada2b0471abb0034%2Fshoot-110123-7.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/69e5cf7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6041x3390+0+318/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2F0d%2F4532124df4d3ada2b0471abb0034%2Fshoot-110123-7.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Chicago police Supt.

O’Neill Burke ha mantenido que su oficina está &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"http://limited in its ability to actually prosecute\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;limitada en su capacidad de realmente procesar&lt;/a&gt; y condenar a agentes federales en servicio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mientras tanto, su oficina ha estado trabajando para desarrollar un sistema que aclare los roles que los policías y los fiscales jugarán en la investigación y en la presentación de cargos contra los agentes federales acusados de delitos, incluidos los tiroteos y otros actos de violencia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El fiscal general Kwame Raoul enfatizó la importancia de tener “un entendimiento común de cuál es la ley en estas situaciones y qué protocolo debería implementarse para hacer cumplir la ley”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No se trata sólo de si crees o no que alguien hizo algo mal, se trata de si, con las evidencias que tienes disponibles, has llegado a un punto donde puedes proceder, donde estás seguro de que puedes probar el caso más allá de una duda razonable”, dijo Raoul en una entrevista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raoul afirmó que comprende las frustraciones de los funcionarios electos y los miembros de la comunidad que han visto videos virales de personas siendo asesinadas por agentes federales. Pero dijo que es crucial que los fiscales sigan las nuevas directrices y advirtió contra el riesgo de sobrepasar su autoridad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Una de las cosas de las que debemos tener cuidado es no caer en lo mismo por lo que criticamos al actual presidente”, dijo. “El presidente Trump ha, en muchas ocasiones, dado directivas muy públicas al Departamento de Justicia y a otras fuerzas del orden para perseguir a individuos específicos”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En los últimos seis meses, los agentes federales han arrasado ciudades en todo el país, llevando a cabo el audaz operativo de aplicación de Trump. Los agentes han desatado niveles sin precedentes de fuerza, utilizando gas lacrimógeno, bolas de gas pimienta y disparando fatalmente a personas en Minneapolis y Chicago en los últimos meses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hasta ahora, ningún agente federal ha sido acusado de cometer un delito mientras estaba en el trabajo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El abogado de Marimar Martínez, la mujer de Chicago que fue baleada por un agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza el otoño pasado en el vecindario de Brighton Park, dijo que es optimista de que el protocolo actuará como “un poco de disuasión”, especialmente si los federales regresan con fuerza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Por lo menos hay una política establecida en el Condado de Cook de que si actúan ilegalmente, al menos podrían estar potencialmente sujetos a algún tipo de investigación”, dijo el abogado Chris Parente. “Creo que eso es mejor que nada”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parente ha sido informado de que hay una investigación activa sobre la conducta del agente Charles Exum por parte de la oficina del fiscal en South Bend, Indiana. Pero si esa investigación no avanza, Parente dijo que recurrirá a los fiscales estatales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Las autoridades en Minneapolis han iniciado una investigación sobre los tiroteos fatales de Renee Good y Alex Pretti, pero no han presentado cargos y están encontrando obstáculos para obtener pruebas del gobierno federal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En el Condado de Cook, un oficial del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) ha sido &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/01/23/ice-officer-charged-with-attacking-immigrant-rights-activist-in-chicago-suburbs\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;acusado de atacar a un manifestante&lt;/a&gt; mientras estaba fuera de servicio en Brookfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Jesse Jackson's family to have the civil rights leader lie in honor at the U.S. Capitol — but alternative Washington, D.C., locations are being discussed, and the push for a Capitol viewing isn't quite over, sources close to the Jackson family confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Johnson denial fell in line with  past precedents set for officials in the Rotunda of the Capitol. As of Friday, the family had been  exploring alternative locations in Washington, including Howard University, the Washington National Cathedral or the National Museum of African American History. The family is also planning for Jackson to lie in honor at the state Capitol in South Carolina — making Jackson the first African American to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still an effort to see whether Jackson could lie in honor  in another part of the Capitol. A concurrent resolution is needed to lie in the Rotunda, but Johnson would have to announce the use of National Statuary Hall to lie in honor. Republicans in September held a vigil for conservative activist Charlie Kirk in National Statuary Hall. Kirk was assassinated last September in Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Old Supreme Court Chamber, the entrance to the House Chamber and the East Central Front Portico have also all been used for those who have laid in state. Lying in state is reserved for officials, like presidents and members of Congress, while lying in honor is reserved for private citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Congressional Black Caucus is actively pursuing options for Jackson to have a Capitol viewing and will return to Washington next week for President Donald Trump's State of the Union address. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former President Jimmy Carter was the last person to lie in state in the Rotunda, which took place last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jackson family this week announced that it would hold events in South Carolina, where Jackson was born, and in Washington, D.C., to allow people to mourn the civil rights leader. Details on the South Carolina and Washington events are still being finalized but will happen between March 1 and 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson will lie in state Thursday, Feb. 26, and Friday, Feb. 27, at Rainbow PUSH’s Kenwood headquarters at 930 E. 50th St. The services both days will start at 10 a.m. A “People’s Celebration” in Chicago will be held at 10 a.m. on Friday, March 6, at House of Hope at 752 E. 114th St. Doors open at 9 a.m. Private homegoing services are scheduled for 10 a.m. Saturday, March 7, at Rainbow PUSH. Doors open at 8 a.m., with limited capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relatives of Jackson said that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/17/what-we-know-rev-jesse-jacksons-death-services\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“all are welcome,”&lt;/a&gt; regardless of political party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson died at age 84 on Tuesday. He had been in declining health for a decade. In 2017 he announced he had been &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2017/11/17/18375473/rev-jesse-jackson-announces-parkinson-s-diagnosis\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; two years earlier, but last April he revealed that it was actually misdiagnosed progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare neurological disorder.  He stepped down as president of PUSH in July 2023, citing health concerns. Jackson appeared onstage at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 2024, when he was presented to the crowd after a video celebrating his life, but he did not speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump was among top political leaders to extend his sympathies after Jackson's death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew him well, long before becoming President,” Trump posted on his Truth Social account. “He was very gregarious — Someone who truly loved people! Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;",

Jesse Jackson, social justice was also entwined with economic justice and labor organizing, including organizing boycotts, pushing for job opportunities and supporting unions to pressure businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Like the entire generation that led the Civil Rights Movement, Rev. Jackson rightly understood that economic exploitation through capitalism was one of the main drivers of racial inequality,” Alvin Tillery Jr., political science professor at Northwestern University, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson’s “life and work serves as a reminder that issues of racial justice are intertwined with both economics and civil rights. From the beginning of his life as an activist, Jackson saw politics, economics and civil rights not as a siloed spheres, but rather as interdependent,” Chris Cooper, political science professor at Western Carolina University in North Carolina, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last February, the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the nonprofit Jackson founded, joined a nationwide boycott of corporate giants such Amazon and Target for rolling back diversity initiatives after President Donald Trump took office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar efforts date back decades. In 1962, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., launched Operation Breadbasket in Atlanta. The campaign sought to create economic opportunities by pressuring companies to hire Black workers, according to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition. In 1966, King appointed Jackson as the first director of Operation Breadbasket in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Jackson, then a Chicago Theological Seminary student, Operation Breadbasket pressured five dairy businesses for more opportunities for Black workers. Three companies negotiated to add jobs for Black workers immediately and two complied after boycotts, according to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Jackson often used boycotts and other economic threats and actions to influence civil rights. He understood that political change often depended on economic actions,” Cooper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/obituaries/2026/02/17/rev-jesse-jackson-civil-rights-leader-rainbow-push-obituary\"   &gt;Rev. Jesse Jackson, civil rights leader and Chicago icon, dead at 84&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chicago's Operation Breadbasket went on to focus on Pepsi and Coca-Cola bottlers and then supermarket chains. It won 2,000 new jobs for Black workers worth $15 million a year in new income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What was different about Rev. Jackson was that he used his Operation PUSH and Rainbow PUSH Coalition to scale up this fight on a national level for the first time,” Tillery said. “In short, he took the fight directly to the Fortune 500 companies and to Wall Street through public pressure campaigns and boycotts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melody Spann-Cooper, CEO of Midway Broadcasting Corp. in Chicago, recalled Jackson was at the first boycott she attended when she was a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was a grocery store called A&amp;amp;P here in Chicago, and it was serving rancid meat in a lot of the stores in the Black communities and Rev. Jackson shut them down,” she told the Chicago Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson founded Operation PUSH in 1971 in Chicago to improve the economic conditions of Black communities across the U.S., according to its website. In the 1970s, it expanded into social and political development using direct action campaigns, a weekly radio broadcast and awards that honored Black people in the U.S. and abroad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Operation PUSH, Jackson also sought to protect Black homeowners, workers and businesses. In 1996, it merged with his National Rainbow Coalition to become the Rainbow PUSH Coalition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson’s efforts to influence business were transformative, Tillery said. “He negotiated diversity agreements, procurement commitments, executive hiring benchmarks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillery added, “The reason every Fortune 500 company today had some form of supplier diversity program before the Trump administration began to attack them is not accidental. That norm was forged in the 1970s and 1980s through sustained pressure campaigns led by Rev. Jackson.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1996, Jackson and the Citizenship Education Fund founded the Wall Street Project to diversify the financial services industry. The initiative is “one of the most underappreciated parts of his legacy,” Tillery said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When Jackson began pressuring investment banks and asset managers to diversify underwriting and capital allocation, many elites were stunned. Civil rights activism had entered high finance,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson took his mission of economic and social justice around the world. In 1979, he traveled to South Africa to investigate the firing of 700 Black workers from a Ford Motor Co. plant and helped lead the international movement to end apartheid, according to the United Auto Workers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stood with the AFL-CIO at mobilizations and worker rallies, from coalfields to campaigns for janitors, the union said in a statement Tuesday. In 2002, Jackson joined the AFL-CIO and local unions in organizing laid-off Enron workers to secure fair severance pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson “brought communities together with a simple, powerful truth: Economic justice and civil rights are inseparable,” AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler and AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Fred Redmond said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson was also a longtime champion for health care, said 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, the country’s largest health care union. In the 1980s, he marched with 1199SEIU picket lines to win organizing rights for tens of thousands of home care workers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pressed for universal health care through his presidential campaigns and the Rainbow PUSH coalition. He also helped secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, according to 1199SEIU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He joined former UAW President Bob King in 2010 on a multicity tour calling for jobs, justice and peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He stood with workers in the streets from Detroit to cities nationwide, demanding industrial policies that create jobs, enforce workers’ and civil rights and put people before profit,” the UAW said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson “understood the bond between civil and workplace rights,” the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said this week. He stood with Teamsters during contentious contract campaigns, including the 1997 UPS national strike and with United Airlines mechanics in 2016. Jackson also rallied in 2023 with UAW Local 551 in Chicago and hundreds of autoworkers during their “Stand Up Strike” that targeted big carmakers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His leadership and solidarity in that moment reflected a lifetime of commitment to the cause of the working class, and the cause of humanity,” the UAW said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contributing: Nicole Jeanine Johnson/WBEZ&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/17/what-we-know-rev-jesse-jacksons-death-services\"   &gt;What we know about Rev.

Doors open at 8 a.m., with limited capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relatives of Jackson said that \"all are welcome,\" regardless of political party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Do not bring your politics, out of respect to Rev. Jesse Jackson and the life that he lived, to these homegoing services. They come respectful and come to say thank you,\" Jesse Jackson Jr. said during a media event in front of the Jackson family home. \"But these homegoing services are welcome to all — Democrat, Republican, liberal and conservative, right wing, left wing, because his life is broad enough to cover the full spectrum of what it means to be an American.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family plans to livestream the services and will later share more information about how to watch from home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where will he be buried?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson will be buried at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/curious-city/2025/06/04/prejudice-follows-us-to-the-grave-the-segregated-past-of-chicago-cemeteries#:~:text=Mayor%20Harold%20Washington%20is%20buried,bring%20it%20to%20an%20end.\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Oak Woods Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, the largest cemetery on the South Side, in Greater Grand Crossing.

In 2015,&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2017/11/17/18375473/rev-jesse-jackson-announces-parkinson-s-diagnosis\"   &gt; Jackson was initially diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, but he revealed last April that he actually had progressive supranuclear palsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How is the political world reacting to his death?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political figures from across the country have weighed in to pay their respects and honor his legacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement, former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama wrote: \"Michelle and I will always be grateful for Jesse's lifetime of service, and the friendship our families share. We stood on his shoulders. We send our deepest condolences to the Jackson family and everyone in Chicago and beyond who knew and loved him.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump also extended his sympathies to Jackson's family in a statement posted to Truth Social Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I knew him well, long before becoming President,\" he said. \"He was very gregarious — Someone who truly loved people! Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago leaders, including Mayor Brandon Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker, also shared their condolences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"In honor of Rev. Jackson's service, and as our city mourns, the Chicago flag will lower to half-staff,\" Mayor Johnson wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker also ordered all flags across the state to fly at half-mast to honor him in a statement posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He broke down barriers, inspired generations, and kept hope alive. Our state, nation, and world are better due to his years of service,\" Pritzker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How are Chicago residents reacting to his death?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the city, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2026/02/17/jesse-jackson-chicago-remembers\"   &gt;Chicago residents mourned Jackson’s death&lt;/a&gt; and urged that his legacy continue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Travis, a congregant of Apostolic Church of God in Woodlawn, said in his youth, his parents brought him to demonstrations organized by Operation Breadbasket, a group Jackson led. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, 64, Travis remembers Jackson as \"instrumental in fighting for justice and freedom for all people.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chloe Gould, 41, a Bronzeville resident, said that his death hit \"like you lost a family member.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of his death, she said she worries about the future of civil rights activism, as activists and leaders have not stepped in to fill his shoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Who is gonna be the civil rights activist now?\" she asked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contributing: Nicole Jeanine Johnson&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

I must be respected. I must be protected. I am ... &lt;i&gt;somebody!&lt;/i&gt;\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That, in essence, is the message Rev. Jackson devoted his life to championing — for Black people in general and himself in particular. From leading Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s open housing campaign in Chicago in 1964, through his close association with the great civil rights leader during the last three years of King’s life, to the tumultuous 1970s, when Jackson started what became the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, to the 1980s, when he ran the first viable presidential campaign by a Black candidate in the United States, to the 1990s, when he traveled the globe, to free hostages, advise leaders, join picket lines and lend his internationally famous name to often desperate causes. To his later years, when he settled into the role as a revered elder statesman of Black Chicago and an unceasing voice for social justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev. Jackson died at age 84 on Tuesday, his family said in a statement. He had been in declining health for a decade; in 2017 he announced he had been &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2017/11/17/18375473/rev-jesse-jackson-announces-parkinson-s-diagnosis\"   &gt;diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; two years earlier, but last April revealed that it was actually misdiagnosed progressive supranuclear palsy, a condition also affecting bodily movements. He stepped down as president of PUSH in July 2023, citing health concerns. Rev. Jackson appeared onstage at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 2024,  when he was presented to the crowd after a video celebrating his life, but did not speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-780000\" name=\"image-780000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/459870a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff8%2Fba%2F8b1db2dd47e29d644649723a99e9%2Fdnctu-082124-24.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e36895/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff8%2Fba%2F8b1db2dd47e29d644649723a99e9%2Fdnctu-082124-24.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/107b35d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff8%2Fba%2F8b1db2dd47e29d644649723a99e9%2Fdnctu-082124-24.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Rev.

Rev. Jesse Jackson was in the public eye for six decades, a tireless wielder of social pressure. He was respected and dismissed, inspiring adoration and disdain, a Chicago institution who left footprints on the world stage, an ardent advocate for civil rights whose attempts to wield political power himself were thwarted, and channeled into the power of protest, persuasion and complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Yet, there are doubts and criticisms raised about this complex man, a man characterized by ambiguity and contradiction,” the New York Times magazine wrote about him in 1972. \"He is a brilliant speaker, a skilled mobilizer. He is also vain and self-seeking, a star, a man of great ambition, a man who, at times, uses the tricks of a demagogue.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is another way to describe a powerful orator who inspired and uplifted millions of people, whether one-on-one or through the media he played skillfully around the world. In everything he did, Jackson was always pushing to be counted and make a difference.

in a three-room, tin-roofed house without running water. His mother was an unwed 16-year-old high school student named Helen Burns. His father, Noah Robinson, was a married neighbor more than twice her age — 33 — with three stepchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Jesse was a toddler, his mother married Charles Jackson, who adopted Jesse when he was about  12. Charles Jackson  worked as a janitor, and sometimes young Jesse would help him  clean buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a deeply segregated time and place. When   baseball star Jackie Robinson came to Greenville for the NAACP, he wasn’t allowed to use the bathroom at the airport. Young Jesse was taunted for his stammer, which would return in moments of excitement later in life. His mother was his first adoring audience. She always told him, Rev. Jackson later recalled: \"You’re going to be somebody. Just hold on.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His calling came early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Jesse was an unusual kind of fella, even when he was just learning to talk,\" Robinson remembered. \"He would say he’s going to be a preacher. He would say, 'I’m going to lead people through the rivers of water.'\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;As a teen, Jackson arrives in Chicago&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson was drawn to Chicago by an uncle, Henry Williams, who lived at 61st and Vernon and worked at the U.S. Postal Service’s Englewood station, but often returned south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He would travel back home in the summertime to visit,\" Rev. Jackson wrote. \"After his stay, we went with him to the station and it was so sad when the train would pull off ... how we desperately wanted to accompany him ... bound for Chicago.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He got his wish at 15, when he was put on the train, fortified with his mother’s ham sandwiches, hard-boiled eggs, sweet potato pie and a jug of lemonade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"God,\" he thought, arriving at the 63rd Street station. \"I am in Chicago.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-820000\" name=\"image-820000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a55b594/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2509x1408+0+796/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa1%2F76%2Fd84cef154bee9ad48e68c3250db0%2Fdashiki-garment-0001a-4518.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4c3d4a3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2509x1408+0+796/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa1%2F76%2Fd84cef154bee9ad48e68c3250db0%2Fdashiki-garment-0001a-4518.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/92800ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2509x1408+0+796/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa1%2F76%2Fd84cef154bee9ad48e68c3250db0%2Fdashiki-garment-0001a-4518.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Rev.

The 6-foot-2-inch student was a three-letter high school athlete — baseball, basketball and football.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1959 he went to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana on an athletic scholarship. It was during a trip home to Greenville for his first Christmas break that Rev. Jackson was drawn, quite by accident, into the civil rights struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was supposed to write a speech — on patriotism, ironically — but the books he needed were not available at the McBee Avenue Colored Branch of the Greenville Public Library. The librarian there sent him with an explanatory note to the main, whites-only library downtown, naively phoning ahead, thinking to smooth the way. What the call did was make sure two police officers were waiting for him as he walked to the library. He tried to get the books he needed; the police threatened to arrest him if he didn’t leave without them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The humiliation stung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I had to break off my Christmas vacation four days early to get back to Illinois to get that speech done,\" Rev. Jackson told The New Yorker in 1992. \"I remember riding that train alone back to Atlanta and to Nashville, and up [to] Chicago and on the bus back to Urbana, thinking the whole way, &lt;i&gt;That library’s public.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;And when I get back home this summer it’s going to go public for real. I’m going to use that library&lt;/i&gt;.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘The Greenville Eight’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so he did. On July 18, 1960, he returned with seven friends, went into the reading room and looked at books, refusing demands that they leave. The police came and arrested them  for disorderly conduct, and they became “The Greenville Eight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subsequent lawsuit led to a ruling that the libraries must be desegregated. Greenville instead shut down all its public libraries, blaming those who tried to use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The efforts being made by a few Negroes to use the White library will now deprive all White and Negro citizens of the benefit of a library,” Greenville Mayor J. Kenneth Cass said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prejudice was not limited to the South. Disappointed with the racial isolation and slights he found in  Illinois, Rev. Jackson transferred to North Carolina Agricultural &amp;amp; Technical College in Greensboro before his junior year. There, he met a first-year student named Jackie Davis Brown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He looked at me, and he said, 'Hey girl, I’m going to marry you',\" she told Frontline. \"Which totally offended me because at that time, I had no interest in being tied down with children and a family and a responsibility.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They married on New Year’s Eve 1962.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-390000\" name=\"image-390000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bcf061b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1928x1082+0+57/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fd6%2Fdc6ffd184263a5098fb3cea44534%2F1-21-lachat-jackson-2.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/224dca9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1928x1082+0+57/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fd6%2Fdc6ffd184263a5098fb3cea44534%2F1-21-lachat-jackson-2.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/004e58e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1928x1082+0+57/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fd6%2Fdc6ffd184263a5098fb3cea44534%2F1-21-lachat-jackson-2.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Jesse Jackson and his wife Jackie share a moment during the Sunday service at Salem Baptist Church on 118th St. &amp;amp; Indiana. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/004e58e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1928x1082+0+57/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fd6%2Fdc6ffd184263a5098fb3cea44534%2F1-21-lachat-jackson-2.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/74712cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1928x1082+0+57/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fd6%2Fdc6ffd184263a5098fb3cea44534%2F1-21-lachat-jackson-2.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/004e58e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1928x1082+0+57/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc7%2Fd6%2Fdc6ffd184263a5098fb3cea44534%2F1-21-lachat-jackson-2.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Jackson and his wife, Jackie, share a moment during the Sunday service at Salem Baptist Church on 118th St. &amp;amp; Indiana in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean Lachat/Sun-Times file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson graduated with a bachelor’s in sociology in 1964.

Jackson was an excellent student who got a D in preaching, because he refused to write out his sermons ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"That’s Jesse. He’s a very brilliant guy. But undisciplined,\" said the Rev. Victor Obenhaus, Jackson’s faculty adviser and a professor of Christian ethics. \"We have very rigid requirements. One has to do with articulating your philosophical and theological groundwork. Jesse couldn’t do that in a coherent fashion.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A desire to meet MLK&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with so many others, Jackson was energized by television coverage of the police attacks on civil rights marchers in Selma in March 1965. He   urged his fellow students to put their abstract notions of faith into action and 30 joined him driving down to Alabama, where Jackson met King adviser Ralph Abernathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev. Jackson insisted he be given a job and an audience with King, and was granted the latter. He urged King to bring his work to Chicago, an uncommon local view, since the most influential Chicago Black ministers were in Mayor Richard J. Daley’s back pocket, and would hold a televised news conference, urging King to stay away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-870000\" name=\"image-870000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bf828ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2100x1179+0+190/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6d%2F8a%2Fe3953ba9c68b7dfec001f6cc7bef%2Fmlk1967summit.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/748ed84/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2100x1179+0+190/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6d%2F8a%2Fe3953ba9c68b7dfec001f6cc7bef%2Fmlk1967summit.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f998db8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2100x1179+0+190/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6d%2F8a%2Fe3953ba9c68b7dfec001f6cc7bef%2Fmlk1967summit.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Jesse Jackson (far right) joins Raby, King, and Ed Berry at the Civil Rights Summit meeting in Chicago in 1966. | \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f998db8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2100x1179+0+190/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6d%2F8a%2Fe3953ba9c68b7dfec001f6cc7bef%2Fmlk1967summit.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bc0c8c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2100x1179+0+190/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6d%2F8a%2Fe3953ba9c68b7dfec001f6cc7bef%2Fmlk1967summit.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f998db8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2100x1179+0+190/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6d%2F8a%2Fe3953ba9c68b7dfec001f6cc7bef%2Fmlk1967summit.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesse Jackson (far right) joins Al Raby, the Rev Martin Luther King and Ed Berry at the Civil Rights Summit meeting in Chicago in 1966.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun-Times file photo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 1966, Rev. Jackson started reaching out to local congregations for help starting what he called \"a ministry of jobs.\" By April, 400 ministers had signed on and Rev. Jackson expanded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s Operation Breadbasket to Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first business approached, the Country Delight dairy, refused to cooperate. For a while. Three days after a boycott was announced, 44 new or upgraded jobs for Blacks were found at the dairy. Rev. Jackson began with dairies, he later explained, “because it is particularly vulnerable. Milk can’t stand around. It has to be sold, or the man suffers a loss.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson also became a voice on the Chicago political scene. In March 1966, when Daley allowed Prince Philip to address the City Council, Rev. Jackson wondered why the royal had been welcomed while King was turned away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Dr. King’s mission is more serious than Prince Philip’s,\" Rev. Jackson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 1966, Rev. Jackson led a march against housing restrictions, guiding 300 supporters, outnumbered seven to one by a \"jeering, missile-throwing\" crowd of 2,000 whites carrying Confederate flags and signs reading, \"Keep Out Black Trash,\" while hurling bottles, rocks and cherry bombs. The marchers turned back after police threatened to arrest the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 4, 1968, King stepped out onto the second-floor balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. Rev. Jackson was in the parking lot below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-3f0000\" name=\"image-3f0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/126b80e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+249/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F16%2F31%2F70b0404532c47fa5c2b6fe1189eb%2Fmlk-jj.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07c98b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+249/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F16%2F31%2F70b0404532c47fa5c2b6fe1189eb%2Fmlk-jj.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b66337e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+249/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F16%2F31%2F70b0404532c47fa5c2b6fe1189eb%2Fmlk-jj.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The Rev.

Billy Kyles, a minister who had urged King to come to Memphis. \"He got himself invited.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moments later a single shot cut down King. Rev. Jackson flew to Chicago, where he appeared on television wearing the same bloody tan turtleneck he had on the evening before, claiming he had cradled King’s head as he died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"On my chest is the stain of blood from Dr. King’s head,\" Rev. Jackson told the cameras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The claim drew furious denunciation from King’s inner circle and caused bitterness that lasted for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I look around and sure enough. … Jesse Jackson’s shirt was drenched in blood,\" King confidante Hosea Williams later said. “And I realized the only way Jesse could’ve gotten that blood was stoop down on that floor of the Lorraine motel, and [he] raked that blood off that floor and put that blood on him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson biographer Marshall Frady viewed the act in context of the tendency of followers of slain prophets to preserve the blood of their fallen martyrs, observing that, even if Williams were correct, the act amounts to “a kind of anointing with King’s very blood,” one proven prophetic in light of subsequent events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"To a considerable degree,\" Frady wrote,  “in the national activation of the black voting rights won by King in Selma, in his perpetuation of King’s vision in the national life, in his ascent to become almost a totemic figure for America’s black community, Jackson has proved to be probably King’s single notably legatee.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev. Jackson was ordained at Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church on June 30, 1968.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The origins of PUSH&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constantly clashing with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC] back in Atlanta, Rev. Jackson formed his own organization, originally called People United to Save Humanity but gradually morphing into the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time magazine devoted a special issue to \"Black America 1970\" in April of that year. \"Any one of a dozen such grass-roots leaders could be used to symbolize the ways in which black gains, however modest, are being achieved in communities,\" Time  wrote, before singling out the minister whose face was on the cover. \"One who is more articulate and arresting than most is Rev. Jesse Jackson, an intense, passionate advocate of using black economic power.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-260000\" name=\"image-260000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3da755b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+220/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F16%2F38%2F0c68e21240d797ab7443d37803ae%2Ftambo-oliver-president-of-the-african-national-congress.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1747a00/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+220/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F16%2F38%2F0c68e21240d797ab7443d37803ae%2Ftambo-oliver-president-of-the-african-national-congress.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c4531b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+220/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F16%2F38%2F0c68e21240d797ab7443d37803ae%2Ftambo-oliver-president-of-the-african-national-congress.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The Rev.

In South Africa, he condemned apartheid as “ungodly,” denouncing its government as a \"terroristic dictatorship\" and \"making more of a stir among both blacks and whites than any American political figure to come here in many years,\" the Washington Post reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev. Jackson’s breakout year was 1983, when he crisscrossed the country, registering Black voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly before the Democratic National Convention in July 1984, Jackson embarked on a tour of Central America. In Nicaragua, he condemned financing of anti-Sandinista insurgents by Ronald Reagan’s administration. In Cuba, he met with Fidel Castro, negotiated the release of 22 American prisoners and brought them back to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I did it for him,\" said Castro, insisting he had freed the prisoners \"as a result of Rev. Jackson’s visit.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The first foray into politics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson ran as a candidate himself in 1984, and did well in the Democratic primaries, garnering 21% of the vote. After Rev. Jackson was quoted in an interview by a friendly Black reporter calling Jews \"Hymies\" and New York \"Hymie town,\" his campaign became bogged down in controversy, particularly after Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, whose Fruit of Islam provided security to Rev. Jackson, threatened to kill the reporter and his wife, and Rev. Jackson was slow to repudiate Farrakhan’s words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rift with the Jewish community would take years to heal, and was widened by Rev. Jackson’s embrace of Yasser Arafat and the cause of Palestinian independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1988, Rev. Jackson ran again and did even better, earning 29% of the primary ballots — 7 million votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson moved from Chicago to Washington in 1989, where he ran for one of two shadow senator positions created by the District of Columbia Council to lobby for D.C. statehood inside Congress. He used that six-year term — which came with no salary, office or budget — to advance his Rainbow Coalition agenda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of pushing for a third presidential run in 1992, Jackson pulled back from politics, recasting himself as a TV commentator, appearing on CNN for eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and threatened to scatter Western hostages to sites that might be attacked by American air strikes, Rev. Jackson went to Baghdad and negotiated their release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment reflects the duality of Rev.

Jackson remained in the thick of politics in the 1990s as President Bill Clinton took office and Jesse Jackson Jr., his second-oldest child, was elected to fill a seat vacated by U.S. Rep. Mel Reynolds, who resigned in 1995 after a jury convicted him of sexual assault charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an initially rocky relationship, Rev. Jackson became an adviser and friend to Clinton, counseling him during the hearings leading to the president’s impeachment by the House and subsequent acquittal by the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1997 Jackson accepted a Clinton appointment as special envoy of the president and secretary of state \"for the promotion of democracy in Africa.\" In that role, he visited troubled republics from Nigeria to the Congo, met with leaders including Nelson Mandela of South Africa, Daniel T. Arap Moi of Kenya and Frederick J.T. Chiluba of Zambia and engaged in government-sanctioned negotiations. In war-torn Sierra Leone on May 24, 1999, he brokered a cease-fire between President Tejan Kabbah, and rebel leader Foday Sankoh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2000 he received the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev. Jackson acknowledged in January 2001 that he’d had an extramarital affair after the National Enquirer learned of Jackson’s relationship with Rainbow PUSH employee Karin Stanford. The couple had a daughter in May 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I fully accept responsibility, and I am truly sorry for my actions,\" Rev. Jackson said. \"As her mother does, I love this child very much and have assumed responsibility for her emotional and financial support since she was born. I was born of these circumstances, and I know the importance of growing up in a nurturing, supportive and protected environment.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Obama and Jackson&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev. Jackson kept a low profile after the scandal, but the rise of Barack Obama prompted him to seek credit for the changes he helped bring. It was hard for Jackson to see the younger man strive for and achieve the true political power — insider power — that had always eluded him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev. Jackson made the rounds of newspaper editorial offices, quietly lobbying for recognition of his role in the ascent of Obama, for laying the groundwork. He felt he deserved some of the credit — but in unguarded moments was less diplomatic, sometimes saying Obama was too white, or talked down to Black people, once muttering \"I want to cut his nuts out\" into an open Fox News microphone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-870000\" name=\"image-870000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31a9601/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1384x777+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fbe%2Fd669d6544a18a7f3702da6da6c0f%2F1-17-podgo-mlk-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aecabbc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1384x777+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fbe%2Fd669d6544a18a7f3702da6da6c0f%2F1-17-podgo-mlk-10.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18cf10f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1384x777+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fbe%2Fd669d6544a18a7f3702da6da6c0f%2F1-17-podgo-mlk-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Rev.

And, of course, injuries and quality of play throughout the spring could change the roster picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Roster decisions out of spring training are based on a number of things,” manager Criag Counsell said Friday when asked about the players competing to make the team. “Certainly, performance is one of them. But they're going to get opportunities, for sure. We signed them because we think they can provide major-league value.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s one possible Opening Day roster configuration, plus the factors the Cubs are weighing this spring:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Starting pitchers (5)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RHP Cade Horton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RHP Jameson Taillon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RHP Edward Cabrera&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LHP Matthew Boyd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LHP Shota Imanaga&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs’ rotation is all but set. What’s left to sort out this spring are rotation order and the Opening Day starter. Horton, after one of the best second-half performances of any starting pitcher last year, is considered the favorite to win the Opening Day nod, but Counsell has not tipped his hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as the Cubs’ pitching staff remains healthy, the rotation crunch will happen when left-hander Justin Steele (elbow surgery) returns from the injured list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Relievers (8)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;RHP Colin Rea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RHP Daniel Palecia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RHP Phil Maton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RHP Hunter Harvey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RHP Jacob Webb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RHP Porter Hodge&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LHP Caleb Thielbar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LHP Hoby Milner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs’ bullpen is also pretty straightforward, but they have interesting options for the final spot. Right-hander Porter Hodge is included here, after a rocky 2025 season that included injury and mechanics issues —  which were likely linked. Hodge, who has served as the Cubs’ closer at times the last two years, is a bounce-back candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs, however, could go a number of ways. If Ryan Rolison or Luke Little stand out this spring, the Cubs could carry a third left-hander. If they want another option who could provide length, Ben Brown or Javier Assad could fill that role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Catchers (3)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C Miguel Amaya&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;C Carson Kelly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DH/C Moisés Ballesteros&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly and Amaya are poised to split time behind the plate. Ballesteros is expected to mostly serve as a designated hitter, but the Cubs want to make sure he gets some catching experience this season. The Cubs can also use the DH spot to get their lineup regulars days off in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Infield (6)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1B Micheal Busch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2B Nico Hoerner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SS Dansby Swanson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3B Alex Bregman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UTL Matt Shaw&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1B Tyler Austin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw is set to play a super-utility role, which will also include reps in the outfield. Austin gives the Cubs a right-handed option off the bench to pair with Busch. But Busch, a left-handed hitter, is also expected to get more at-bats against left-handed pitching this season, compared to years past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outfield (4)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LF Ian Happ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CF Pete Crow-Armstrong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RF Seiya Suzuki&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OF Dylan Carlson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth outfielder spot is one of the more intriguing battles in Cubs camp this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlson, a non-roster invitee, is included in this roster projection. His switch-hitting ability could be valuable off the bench, and he’s a former first-round pick who in 2021 finished third in NL Rookie of the Year Voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and fellow NRI outfielder Chas McCormick are both proven major-leaguers who were derailed by injury. The pair appear to be neck-and-neck in the competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already on the 40-man roster are Kevin Alcántara and Justin Dean. Both have minor-league option years left, which will factor in as the Cubs ponder roster decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Injured list&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LHP Justin Steele&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RHP Shelby Miller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele and Miller are both recovering from elbow surgeries. Steele is targeting May or June for his return to a major-league mound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller had an internal brace procedure this past offseason to address his UCL injury, before he signed a two-year deal worth $2.5 million this spring. Like Steele, Miller avoided a full Tommy John surgery, which should shorten his recovery. He hopes to return late in the season, but pitching in 2026 is not guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module

Across eight variations the dancers prance and flirt, partnering with a light touch through at times impossibly brisk footwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gayeon Jung and Evan Boersma (on opening night) share a waltzing duet marked by astonishing lifts, as Jung alternately leaps into Boersma’s arms and then seems to almost fly away. Elsewhere, the men aim to outdo each other with bravura tours and cabrioles, and a vivacious Ao Wang practically levitates as she bounces through a rapid-fire duet with Jung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Jack Mehler’s giant tree looming upstage, it’s as though the balls of Vienna are removed from the drawing room and restaged as a frolic in the bracing country air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-7d0000\" name=\"image-7d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a297a9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2020+0+202/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2b%2F29%2Fe8138f7a48d09eca1e0f6e5142ae%2F4-secular-games-the-joffrey-ballet-ensemble-photo-by-cheryl-mann.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8df97a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2020+0+202/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2b%2F29%2Fe8138f7a48d09eca1e0f6e5142ae%2F4-secular-games-the-joffrey-ballet-ensemble-photo-by-cheryl-mann.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aa1e5ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2020+0+202/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2b%2F29%2Fe8138f7a48d09eca1e0f6e5142ae%2F4-secular-games-the-joffrey-ballet-ensemble-photo-by-cheryl-mann.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"4_Secular Games_The Joffrey Ballet Ensemble_Photo by Cheryl Mann.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aa1e5ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2020+0+202/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2b%2F29%2Fe8138f7a48d09eca1e0f6e5142ae%2F4-secular-games-the-joffrey-ballet-ensemble-photo-by-cheryl-mann.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/736812f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2020+0+202/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2b%2F29%2Fe8138f7a48d09eca1e0f6e5142ae%2F4-secular-games-the-joffrey-ballet-ensemble-photo-by-cheryl-mann.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aa1e5ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2020+0+202/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2b%2F29%2Fe8138f7a48d09eca1e0f6e5142ae%2F4-secular-games-the-joffrey-ballet-ensemble-photo-by-cheryl-mann.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martha Graham’s 1962 piece “Secular Games” features a loose and playful energy felt throughout the Joffrey’s “American Icons” program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo by Cheryl Mann&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graham’s 1962 piece “Secular Games” continues this loose and playful energy. Ostensibly set on a Greek island beach, the piece draws less explicitly from myth than Graham’s early work (no minotaurs, no Medea). Still, her modernist hallmarks endure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here six men, barechested, preen, stretch, arc, and contract like a clutch of peacocks, jousting their way through sets of stag leaps and other Graham angularities. As their torsos flex and ripple in courtship and competition, they manipulate their female partners into gloriously off-kilter shapes, arabesques askew and elbows akimbo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while all in all, this is a showcase of athletic masculine virility, a pas de deux for Boersma and Olivia Duryea pulls the work in a classical direction, as the pair moves together in fluid unity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An excerpt from Joffrey’s “Postcards” (1980) is similarly lighthearted, enriched by the surprise appearance of mezzo-soprano Camille Robles. Clad in white, Anais Bueno and Stefan Gonçalvez execute a sinuous and youthful pas de deux. Bueno’s port de bras are exquisitely expressive, and the brief work feels both romantic and fresh. Robles’s rendition of a Satie chanson evokes the Parisian café setting and leaves the audience longing for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-1c0000\" name=\"image-1c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b3e15a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2020+0+180/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faa%2F54%2Ff8b23d424a36951b70502f021f11%2F6-postcards-anais-bueno-and-stefan-goncalvez-photo-by-cheryl-mann.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f957f21/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2020+0+180/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faa%2F54%2Ff8b23d424a36951b70502f021f11%2F6-postcards-anais-bueno-and-stefan-goncalvez-photo-by-cheryl-mann.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d71a5b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2020+0+180/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faa%2F54%2Ff8b23d424a36951b70502f021f11%2F6-postcards-anais-bueno-and-stefan-goncalvez-photo-by-cheryl-mann.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"6_Postcards_Anais Bueno and Stefan Gonçalvez_Photo by Cheryl Mann .jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d71a5b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2020+0+180/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faa%2F54%2Ff8b23d424a36951b70502f021f11%2F6-postcards-anais-bueno-and-stefan-goncalvez-photo-by-cheryl-mann.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07bc433/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2020+0+180/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faa%2F54%2Ff8b23d424a36951b70502f021f11%2F6-postcards-anais-bueno-and-stefan-goncalvez-photo-by-cheryl-mann.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d71a5b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2020+0+180/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faa%2F54%2Ff8b23d424a36951b70502f021f11%2F6-postcards-anais-bueno-and-stefan-goncalvez-photo-by-cheryl-mann.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anais Bueno and Stefan Gonçalvez execute a pas de deux in an excerpt from Robert Joffrey’s “Postcards.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo by Cheryl Mann &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mood shifts dramatically with the final work: Glen Tetley’s “Voluntaries,” created in 1973 for the Stuttgart Ballet as a memorial for his friend John Cranko. If the rest of “American Icons” channels America’s youthful exuberance, “Voluntaries” is a move into maturity, alternately elegiac and hopeful, grappling with mortality and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Voluntaries” begins in silence and stillness, Joffrey principals Victoria Jaiani and Dylan Gutierrez in white unitards center stage against the backdrop of a glowing orb. They move forward and, as Jaiani extends her endless leg, the first chord of Poulenc’s “Concerto for Organ, Strings and Timpani” crashes down, breaking the spell, and she is lifted, spiraling toward the sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the full company on stage, the work is a perpetual motion machine, the dancers moving in unison and in canon through motifs surely grueling in their technical demands. Tetley’s choreography is classical in essence but requires the dancers to twist and contract along unexpected meridians as they breathe through the endlessly iterating arabesques and sidelong tilts of modern dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The men eat up the stage with liquid leaps; the women are swept into daring lifts, piking overhead, diving to their partners’ ankles, and repeatedly borne aloft in narrow X’s reminiscent of the Crucifixion — an image later made explicit as the dancers repeatedly extend their arms, birdlike, into a downturned cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The religious, or spiritual, overtones are clear, with the organ blasts contributing to the air of majesty. As an exploration of grief, “Voluntaries” is emotional and expansive. With a purity of movement and intent, there is nothing coy happening here, just pain, joy and transcendence. The whole evening delivers, but in the stunning hands — and legs — of the Joffrey dancers, “Voluntaries” lifts the program to the heavens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

County officials had asked lawmakers for an extension, following a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/11/07/cook-county-property-tax-bills-due-dec-15-after-several-months-delay\"   &gt;several-month delay&lt;/a&gt; of second installment bills for 2024, to give property owners “some breathing room,” Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle and Cook County Treasurer Maria Pappas said in a joint news release Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sun-Times reported in November that the delay was caused by a “critical overhaul” of the county’s property tax computer system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preckwinkle and Pappas — who are both up for reelection this year — said in the news release that their offices “remain in close coordination to continue improving the system, with staff in regular communication throughout the day to keep the process moving forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payments can be made online at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"cookcountytreasurer.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;cookcountytreasurer.com&lt;/a&gt;. The first installment is 55% of a property owner’s total tax bill from the previous year, with exemptions applied to second installments due later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the treasurer's office accepts partial payments, failing to pay in full on time will result in a 0.75% late charge per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The county will distribute money collected through the first property tax bill cycle to local government agencies within 30 days of receipt of the funds, county officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook County properties are reassessed on a triennial basis, meaning that one-third of the county is reassessed each year. New property values are not reflected until the second installment of annual property tax bills the year after the reassessment.&lt;/p&gt;",

Three fights in the first nine seconds in the first meeting put the 4 Nations in the spotlight, and their epic final won by Canada in overtime only built the anticipation for the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Canada did its part by rallying to beat Finland 3-2 earlier in the day, the U.S. had no trouble against the Slovaks, who made an improbable run and were simply overmatched. They'll face the Finns for bronze on Saturday night, looking for just the second hockey medal in the country's history after getting the first with a third-place finish in Beijing in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is playing for gold after the semifinals were a much easier go than the quarterfinals against Sweden, when overtime was needed to survive a scare. Dylan Larkin, Tage Thompson, Hughes and Eichel scored the four goals on 23 shots that chased Samuel Hlavaj out of Slovakia's net past the midway point of the second period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson, one of just a handful of newcomers who did not play at the 4 Nations, exited later in the second after blocking a shot. He was held out the rest of the way, according to the NBC broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hughes got his second just after a power play expired, and Brady Tkachuk scored on a breakaway with just over nine minutes left to provide some more breathing room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goaltender Connor Hellebuyck did his job as his teammates outshot Slovakia by a substantial margin. Everything he has done at the Olympics has validated coach Mike Sullivan's decision to go with Hellebuyck as the U.S. starter over Jake Oettinger and Jeremy Swayman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. last reached the final in 2010 when it lost to Canada in overtime on Sidney Crosby's famous golden goal. Crosby's status is uncertain this time after getting injured in the quarterfinals Wednesday and not playing Friday against Finland. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

But it’s crunch time for every team, every program and every coach and player. The dreams and goals are so much more in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following are the 25 teams ranked in this past week’s Super 25 rankings — all hopeful of making plenty of noise in coming weeks — who are chasing some kind of history. We examine each team’s current status and hopes as it relates and compares to past history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 1 Benet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the program’s first state championship won last season, Benet has its eyes set on joining a select group of programs and royalty: back-to-back state champions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if this team has everything it needs to win a state championship this year — size, intimidating interior defense, rebounding, shooting and experienced guard play — it’s never, ever easy to do, no matter the circumstances or players returning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is far from a sure thing. But if the top-ranked Redwings reach that point of playing for a state championship, it will be their fifth title game appearance since 2014. That would be the most state title game appearances by any program during that time — more than Young, Morgan Park, Simeon and DePaul Prep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 2 DePaul Prep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move up to Class 4A presents something new — and daunting — after winning 2A and 3A titles the past three seasons. But a state championship next month would give the Rams four straight titles and entry into rare company. Only two teams have accomplished this in state history: Peoria Manual (1994-1997) and Simeon (2010-2013).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 3 Curie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curie is among the city basketball giants. The consistent, high-level of success the Condors have enjoyed probably isn’t appreciated enough. While it did win a state championship in 2016, the other recent giants of the Public League — Simeon, Morgan Park and Young — all have multiple state titles. Curie and coach Mike Oliver have a shot at joining that club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 4 Kankakee&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The faithful have waited a long time for this. It was just a little over 11 months ago when Kankakee lost a sectional heartbreaker — a 65-63 loss to Metamora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kankakee returned the best player in school history from last season, 6-6 wing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lincoln Williams, and then welcomed back transfer EJ Hazelett, a Division I prospect headed to Indiana State, this past summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as one of the true Class 3A favorites, the hype in Kankakee is palpable, their fervor is felt, as the Kays are searching for their first-ever IHSA State Finals appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 5 Warren&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legendary coach Chuck Ramsey won big in his 19 years as head coach at Warren. Now coach Zack Ryan is doing so as well. There are 11 sectional titles and three state runner-up finishes in program history, leaving only one thing left for this program to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After falling just short last season, can the Blue Devils get over the hump and claim a state championship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 6 Neuqua Valley&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coach Todd Sutton has won 700-plus games and reached a pair of supersectionals. But the program is still in search of its first trip to state. The road is very difficult but doable with the talent the Wildcats possess and the season they’ve put together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 7 Homewood-Flossmoor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vikings broke through two years ago under coach Jamere Dismukes, capturing their first-ever state title. But a trip to state and another state trophy — and under a new coach, Brandin Brown — really would solidify H-F as the preeminent program in the south suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 8 Bolingbrook&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2015, Bolingbrook has won four sectional championships and qualified for state three times. While they’ve brought home three trophies, finishing third in 2015 and 2017 and fourth in 2022, the Raiders have never played in a state championship game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It starts with winning arguably the state’s best sectional, where No. 1 Benet and No. 6 Neuqua Valley are the top two seeds. If it can take those two down? The Raiders could be on their way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 9 Loyola&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been 50 years since the last time Loyola reached the IHSA State Finals. They came close in 2006, 2014 and the Covid-interrupted season of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can the Ramblers beat Catholic League foe DePaul and neighborhood rivals New Trier and Evanston in the sectional? If so, it’s a legit taking-off-point as it would then enter the supersectional as the favorite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 10 St. Patrick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last season the Shamrocks and longtime coach Mike Bailey finally broke through, reaching the State Finals and finishing third in Class 3A. Now they take a step up. Can St. Pat’s go on a memorable run in 4A?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 11 Marist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RedHawks won 29 games two years ago and 31 last season. They are knocking on the door of 30 wins again this season. But deep postseason runs at Marist have been lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a sectional title 45 years ago — the only sectional championship in program history — but no Marist team has ever reached the IHSA State Finals. This one has a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 12 New Trier&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a long history of high-level success at New Trier, going back decades under multiple coaches. New Trier has qualified for state in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and four times since the turn of the century — 2000, 2002, 2023 and 2024. But an elusive state championship is what’s been missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 13 Evanston&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like its biggest rival, New Trier, the Evanston basketball program has also had a huge historical presence in the sport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, six of the last seven coaches — Jack Burmaster, Herb Williams, Mike Hart, Paul Pryma, Bobby Locke and Mike Ellis — have all taken at least one team to state. Ellis has taken three teams alone, losing in the 2019 state championship game and finishing third in 2018 and again last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s been a long, long time, nearly 60 years in fact, since the Wildkits won their only state championship. While it’s not an obvious state title contender, can Evanston, a fun watch with its offensive punch and perimeter shooting, match or surpass last year’s run?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 14 Fremd&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fremd basketball has won a ton of games, spanning five decades, under longtime coaches Mo Tharp and Bob Widlowski. Both had a team that finished fourth in the state — Tharp’s 1993 team and Widlowski’s 2017 team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something special is afoot again. Now a fresh-faced coach, Mike Brown, has a chance to add his name to the Fremd history books as the Vikings earned a No. 1 sectional seed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 15 St. Ignatius&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program’s relevancy has been raised under coach Matt Monroe, who took over in 2016. There was a third-place finish in 2022 and a fourth-place finish in 2023, the first state trophies won in program history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the only team to have beaten top-ranked Benet, there should be a belief the Wolfpack could potentially better those previous finishes this year and play for a state championship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 16 Palatine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The record-breaking season came just two years ago. The Pirates broke the school record for wins (28) and reached its first-ever IHSA State Finals, where it finished fourth in the state in Class 4A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a return trip to state this year — Palatine is the No. 2 sectional seed and does own a win over top-seeded Fremd — the Pirates would go to another level when it comes to Mid-Suburban League basketball royalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coach Eric Millstone’s program would become just the second Mid-Suburban League school with two state trophies in the trophy case. Schaumburg was the other in 1999 (fourth in Class AA) and 2001 (Class AA state champs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 17 Mount Carmel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t want to sell the fortunes of this year’s team short. However, the youthful Caravan will be hard pressed to duplicate the program’s very best, both when it comes to the distant past (state champions in 1985) or recent history (state runner-up in 2024).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about a third straight sectional championship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the No. 4 seed playing on its home floor in the sectional, winning three in a row — and with the bulk of its team coming back next season — would be an unprecedented program achievement and a big-time accomplishment. And it would certainly be a launching point to next season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 18 Kaneland&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to start with the unbeaten record. Yes, the Knights are a perfect 29-0. When will the first defeat come? Will it come?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There has never been an unbeaten state champion since the arrival of four classes in 2007. There hasn’t been an unbeaten state champion since Seneca’s 35-0 team in 2006. The last big school state champ with a perfect record was King in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most won’t know or remember, Kaneland does have a pair of IHSA State Finals appearances. There was the Class A state runner-up finish in 1973 and a state quarterfinal appearance in 1982. But a lot of time has passed since the Knights played on the state’s biggest stage — and even longer for an unbeaten state champ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 19 Glenbard East&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the top seed in the sectional, the Rams, who are 27-3, should surpass the school’s all-time win total of 28 victories next week with a regional championship. Plus, a soft sectional also provides a lot of runway for a postseason push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is a lot of work still to do in order to match the school’s best team and season. The 2010-11 team won 28 games and reached the state semifinals before settling for a third-place finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 20 Waukegan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a strong postseason run, this group will return relevancy to Waukegan basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, this is a program many believed was dead and buried after a 3-27 season just four years ago. Coach Ron Ashlaw and this group has pumped life back into Waukegan basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a sectional appearance last season and a likely return this season. But if the Bulldogs make the most of a third opportunity playing Warren in the sectional? The postseason ceiling will be determined by how well it can consistently defend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There hasn’t been a sectional title since the Jereme Richmond days 16 years ago. Taking down Jaxson Davis and Company will be a monumental task. They’ve lost twice to Warren — by three points back in December and by 13 points last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 21 Lincoln Park&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lions made their first city title game appearance in over 120 years this season, so there is already a huge sense of accomplishment at the North Side school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will soon need to turn the page and be on the quest of winning the first sectional championship in school history. That’s the big picture goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just winning a regional championship won’t be easy to do as the No. 6 seed in a loaded sectional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 22 Hillcrest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this program has done is win. Since 1990 — first under coach Tom Cappel and then for the past 19 years under Don Houston — the Hawks have been a perennial power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highlight was the 2010 state championship. But are Don Houston’s Hawks in the midst of writing a new memorable chapter in Country Club Hills?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a late-season push and a weakened Class 3A field, suddenly Hillcrest appears to be a significant player this postseason. This would make five IHSA State Finals appearances if the Hawks can return to state for the first time since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 23 Kenwood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been a budding program for some time now. And the Broncos have been so close in recent years to reaching the IHSA State Finals, losing in the supersectional in 2023 and again last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those two teams were expected to get there — and beyond. Both of those teams were awarded No. 1 sectional seeds. Last year’s team was 27-1 and the top-ranked team overall heading into the postseason, while the 2023 team was ranked No. 3 in the Super 25 when the regular season ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s team is entering the postseason in a completely different mode and fashion. As the No. 7 seed in the tough Mount Carmel Sectional, the Broncos are a sleeper and looking to sneak up on some higher-seeded foes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With two juniors leading the way, Kenwood looks to play the role of spoiler and build momentum heading into next season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 24 Young&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With four state championships and three state runner-up finishes since 1998, Young is already an established state powerhouse. But the Dolphins are also not accustomed to losing in the sectional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;True, it’s only been three years without a sectional championship. However, a sectional loss this season would make it four years without winning one, something unheard of in the Tyrone Slaughter era. It would be the longest stretch for the Dolphins since Slaughter took over as coach in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 25 Hyde Park&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The history of playing high-stakes basketball late in the season is short. Very short. It basically starts and ends with the 2008-2009 team, coached by the late Donnie Kirksey with starring roles provided by Malcolm Griffin and Fabyon Harris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to playing in a city championship game that season, which it lost to North Lawndale, Hyde Park won its only sectional championship. The run ended in a supersectional loss to Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under coach Jerrel Oliver, Hyde Park has been inching its way closer. The Thunderbirds have won three straight regional championships. But they’ve lost in the sectional semifinals all three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year? The road is paved pretty nicely for the Thunderbirds. Now can they take advantage of it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeded first in a very winnable sectional, Hyde Park is in prime position to make program history. The likes of De La Salle, King, Leo, Hillcrest and Thornton are the beatable teams standing in its way of a state semifinal appearance in Champaign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
