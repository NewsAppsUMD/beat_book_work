Robin Kelly and Raja Krishnamoorthi as the only candidates &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/what-to-know-us-senate-primary-midterms-dick-durbin-seat\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;in a field of 10&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who met the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/02/Nexstar-Debate-Criteria-2026-1.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;network’s requirements to&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debate opened with Stratton and Krishnamoorthi once again trading barbs over campaign funds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratton took shots at Krishnamoorthi for &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/12/08/raja-krishnamoorthi-senate-campaign-donors-trump-allies-maga-money\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;taking campaign contributions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from supporters of President Donald Trump, as well as an executive at a company contracted by ICE — a month after Stratton went on the offensive during an &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/01/26/senate-debate-sun-times-wbez-uchicago-krishnamoorthi-stratton-kelly\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;hourlong debate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hosted by the Chicago Sun-Times, WBEZ and UChicago’s Institute of Politics and International House&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnamoorthi shot back at Stratton for allowing the Democratic Lieutenant Governor’s Association to take money from CoreCivic, a private prison and ICE contractor, in 2024. He added that he had since donated the money he received to three immigrant groups, which he did not name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those are his values, he’s not going to be one to stand up to the people,” Stratton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnamoorthi shot back: \"I’m an immigrant, I don't need a lecture on standing up to ICE.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnamoorthi once again called to specifically abolish “Trump’s ICE\" as opposed to Stratton's wider call to abolish ICE. Kelly said U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem must be removed and federal agents “have to have rules like regular police officers do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/01/26/senate-debate-illinois-krishnamoorthi-stratton-kelly\"   &gt;Lt.

The war started Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas led an attack that took 251 hostages and killed nearly 1,200 Israelis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratton said she wanted to “see the suffering end” and wants Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to step down, but added that she believes Israel has a right to “safety and security.” When the moderators asked her a second time if what Israel is doing is genocide, she stumbled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnamoorthi said he wanted to see existing restrictions on foreign military funding enacted across the board as a means of reaching a two-state solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly noted she is a co-sponsor of the Block the Bombs Act, which would block the president from selling or exporting offensive weapons systems to Israel, and also called for Netanyahu to step down. She was the only candidate who would call Israel's actions genocide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There were a lot of things that happened before Oct. 7, also,” Kelly said. “It may not have started that way, but genocide was the result.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The candidates' remarks were posted online after the debate and can be found at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://wgntv.com/news/politics/wgn-democratic-senate-primary-debate-kelly-krishnamoorthi-stratton-02192026/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;WGNTV.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also running for the Democratic nomination are Steve Botsford Jr., Sean Brown, Awisi A.

They’re starting to feel each other out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unseld said that Giddey and Jones have started making comments on who they would like to be paired with, and that the two would be on a minutes restriction. These remaining 26 games are important in seeing who the Bulls want to keep around in the next phase of executive vice president of basketball operations &lt;b&gt;Artutras Karnisovas’&lt;/b&gt; plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Size disadvantage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls were already at a size disadvantage before the trade deadline, and they’re certainly facing an uphill battle after acquiring an abundance of guards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls aren’t going to get taller or stronger over the last portion of the season, leaving the coaching staff to get creative with their defensive coverages. They can start blitzing pick-and-rolls, picking up full court or having the roll man play more at the level of the screen rather than in a traditional drop coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to have to try and do different things, pressure, try to junk the game up at times, keep teams off balance,” Unseld said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls entered Thursday ranked 29th in opponents’ turnover percentage (12.3%). They haven’t been a very aggressive defense because of their lack of size and rim protection in the paint. With &lt;b&gt;Nick Richards&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Jalen Smith&lt;/b&gt; as their only nominal centers, the Bulls will have to be more of a pressing defense to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second-year forward &lt;b&gt;Matas Buzelis&lt;/b&gt; likely will take on more defensive responsibility. He has proven to be an imposing shot-blocker while serving as a weak-side defender. He has improved his reading of opposing offenses, which has allowed him to react quicker and use his long wingspan to rack up steals, deflections and be a rim deterrent for a team that desperately needs one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Buzelis has] done a better job of keeping those small, quicker, athletic wings and guards in front,” Unseld said. “We keep putting it on him, as far as increasing his workload, his retention to that side of the ball.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Home cooking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls began a seven-game homestand Thursday. The Bulls don’t play their next road game until March 5 in Phoenix. For such a new group trying to find its way together, this time at home could be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh, definitely,” Dillingham said. “Because we’re not on the road as much, [then] we all can be closer together. While we’re at home, [we can] get some wins and get some home-field advantage with the fans.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The number after DX corresponds to the density, with higher numbers allowing for larger buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Planning and Development’s zoning administrator said the proposed tower at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/07/14/west-town-developer-domus-30-story-residential-tower-fulton-market\"   &gt;215 N. Racine Ave.&lt;/a&gt; was “not appropriate,” making a rare recommendation against the project. The highest level of zoning approved in the project's area is DX-7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Plan Commission voted in favor of the project, which will advance to the Committee on Zoning, Landmarks and Building Standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A DPD representative said during the meeting that the agency isn't necessarily opposed to the project. It recommended Domus purchase nearby land to expand the project’s boundaries, or reduce the building’s size and unit count to match the area’s density.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domus is proposing a 29-story tower with 347 apartments, including 70 affordable units. It would have studios, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, the larger of which are a rarity for the area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There would also be ground floor commercial space, 88 parking spots and an amenity terrace with a pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project includes the purchase of land at 1240 W. Carroll Ave., which would be turned into a privately-managed public park, according to the development team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest requests from Fulton Market residents is green space, along with more family-sized units, Ald. Walter “Red” Burnett (27th) said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no green space whatsoever,” Burnett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of speakers, many from West Loop or Fulton Market, during the meeting's public comment period spoke in favor of the project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the West Central Association Chamber of Commerce wasn’t on board. The chamber’s executive director, Patti Doyle, said they were against the higher zoning designation and the precedent it sets for the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To be clear, the [chamber] supports more density. We want more family-oriented units and more affordable housing,” Doyle said. “Our position here is about process and precedent and ensuring that growth happens in a way that is consistent, predictable and aligned with long-term planning and growth for the Near West Side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DPD Commissioner Ciere Boatright voiced support for Domus' project and said she’s “hyperaware” of the city’s need for more mixed-income housing and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also acknowledged how projects of 215 N. Racine’s scale can create a slippery slope, because those larger projects don’t always get built. Other times, properties get sold after the city rezones them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financing for the $175 million project is in place, according to the development team. Boatright said the development agreement includes a clause stipulating the property’s zoning can be reversed if its ownership changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The building alone really fits into what Fulton Market is and where it’s going,” Burnett said. “We need this housing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Plan Commission also approved a 32-story residential tower at 1338 W.

Angela Clay’s (46th) office. Some neighbors weren’t on board with the building that they said is too dense for the area, while supporters argued that the neighborhood needs more housing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on Thursday, speakers overwhelmingly supported the project and pointed to the rapid rise of Chicago rents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Plan Commission also gave approval to Sarah’s on Sunnyside, a building for the nonprofit Sarah’s Circle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Located at 4432-4458 N. Clarendon Ave., the site will serve women facing homelessness, offering 54 supportive housing units for single women, staff office space and community space for residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The efficiency units will be 480 square feet and will target homeless women earning 30% of the area median income.&lt;/p&gt;",

They ended a playoff drought that dated back to 2017 and won a postseason game for the first time since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge this season for Berhalter and the Fire is to reach another level and grow into a true Eastern Conference contender &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/fire/2025/10/21/after-eight-years-away-fire-finally-set-for-playoff-return\"   &gt;after finishing eighth in 2025,&lt;/a&gt; 13 points behind the first-place Philadelphia Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s turning into a good team like the Fire did last year or maturing into a really good one like they hope to in 2026, they know both steps are difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They might be equally hard,” said Fire attacker Philip Zinckernagel, a 2025 MLS All-Star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berhalter, Zinckernagel and the Fire open the season Saturday night in Houston against the Dynamo. Despite selling midfielder Brian Gutierrez in December to Mexican club Chivas de Guadalajara, the Fire arguably have a stronger roster than 2025. Through free agency, they added experienced midfielder Robin Lod while signing promising South African defender Mbekezeli Mbokazi and acquiring Swedish midfielder Anton Salétros from Stockholm-based AIK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re also in their second year under Berhalter, who understands the grind of an MLS schedule. He said the Fire’s focus is having a strong season to position themselves to win a championship, and not trying to win a trophy in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to be well-positioned as we go into the playoffs, to be able to win playoff series and keep moving,” Berhalter said. “It’s easier said than done, but what I’d say is the group understands the expectations. We’ve added quality to this group, we’ve added experience to this group, so we’re hoping to be better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being better than the 2025 Fire would mean shoring up the team defense. They gave up 60 goals last year, fourth-worst in the East. Because of those issues, the Fire only finished with a plus-8 goal differential despite scoring the second-most goals in the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More important than goal difference, the Fire could only clinch a playoff berth with two games to spare and were thrown into the Eastern Conference wild-card game. They beat Orlando City 3-1 in that home match but earned the right to face the Union and were dispatched in two games that highlighted the gulf between the Fire and an MLS power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zinckernagel wants to do better in 2026. He said the Fire have the high-quality players, potential and hunger to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ideally, we want to be qualifying for the playoffs much earlier, maybe competing for [the Supporters’] Shield, or be at the top of our conference,” Zinckernagel said. “It’s still a project that’s only been a year since Gregg came in and we’re building on our playing style and trying to get better every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least for the Fire, the questions around the 2026 team are different from most of the last 15 years. Instead of wondering about the future of the coach or whether the team is making progress, the subject is if they can build on legitimate success and rise to the level of a true MLS contender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zinckernagel said that isn’t adding any pressure to him and his teammates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The team is very motivated and hungry to get better and take [the] next steps. We made it to the playoffs last year, we won at home but we want to make it further,” Zinckernagel said. “We want to set the tone for this club to be up there as a team that can compete and be in the playoffs every season – not only being in the playoffs but also achieving something.”&lt;/p&gt;",

They were then cuffed and taken to a holding area to receive medical care. After that, the staff left the holding area to tend to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, “Duncan’s body slumped forward in the holding area and remained in that position until correctional staff and medical staff returned,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duncan was transported to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recently released findings, the medical examiner’s office listed the cause of Duncan’s death as cardiac arrest “during physical struggle with restraint.” Smoke inhalation, atherosclerosis and obesity were listed as secondary contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear how long the fire was burning in the cell before Duncan and his cellmate were removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duncan’s death was one of nine recorded at the jail last year, according to the sheriff’s office. Of the remaining eight, two deaths were ruled suicides, and two were determined to be from natural causes. The cause and manner of death of the other four are pending the completion of autopsies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew McLoughlin of the Illinois Network for Pretrial Justice said he wasn’t surprised to hear about the details of Duncan’s case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Deaths in Cook County Jail have been all too common over the last decade,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that many of them are a result of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.injusticewatch.org/project/jail-deaths/2024/cook-county-jail-deaths-2023/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;inadequate supervision and medical care&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are incredibly concerned that the Cook County sheriff's office has made clear that they are unable to keep people that are in their custody safe,” McLoughlin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A homicide ruling by the medical examiner indicates that another person caused Duncan’s death, but it does not imply that a criminal act took place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force is investigating Duncan’s death for any potential criminal behavior by staff, according to the sheriff’s office. The sheriff’s office custodial investigations unit and the sheriff’s office of professional review are also conducting their own investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But McLoughlin said he’s not confident that the investigations will deliver justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Speaking to the volume of instances where these deaths have happened, people have not been brought to justice, and there haven't been fundamental changes made over at the jail to prevent deaths like these,” McLoughlin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheriff’s office plans to pursue criminal charges against Duncan’s cellmate, who the spokesperson said has admitted to starting the fire.&lt;/p&gt;",

Dillingham was the 11th man, and guard Jaden Ivey did not play in the Bulls’ 110-101 loss against the Raptors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dillingham is used to playing under a microscope. He was drafted No. 8 overall to an ascending Timberwolves team that made the Western Conference Finals during his rookie year. Every mistake was magnified given the championship aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s kind of the situation I’ve been going through since I got into the NBA,” said Dillingham, who played 10 minutes on Thursday. “I just try to figure out what’s the best way I can impact the game in whatever minutes I get.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, in Chicago, he was supposed to be removed from those lofty expectations. The Bulls were supposed to afford Dillingham a runway to explore his immense offensive talents. In the last game before the All-Star break, Dillingham played a season-high 30 minutes and scored 16 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dillingham and Ivey were the two promising players the team acquired at the deadline, so seeing them receive scarce or no playing time was weird. Acting coach Wes Unseld Jr. said Ivey’s DNP was a “basketball decision.” Ivey said he was healthy and practiced in full before Thursday’s game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was prepared to play,” Ivey said. “[The guards] were up in the air as far as who was going to play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outcome of games should be secondary for the Bulls at this juncture. The goal at the trade deadline was to escape the dreaded middle the franchise seemed destined for each year. But the coaching staff not prioritizing the two young guards they added shows a lack of foresight and isn’t instilling any confidence for a fan base growing restless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with the roster at full strength, Dillingham didn’t enter the game until the 2:18 mark of the first quarter. Ivey was relegated to the bench. Minimizing Ivey and Dillingham’s roles does no good for the Bulls going forward. Ivey will be a restricted free agent this summer, and the Bulls have to make a decision on Dillingham’s third-year option in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dillingham talked when he first came to Chicago about how he lost his confidence in Minnesota. He’s a dynamic offensive talent who can break his man down off the dribble. Dillingham showed both what makes him a tantalizing offensive player and so maddening with a key three-pointer and a subsequent turnover. It’s far too early to determine if Dillingham or Ivey is worth keeping beyond their current contracts, but playing them is the only way to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I like Josh’s game because he can do everything,” Dillingham said at shootaround. “He can guard one through five, shoot the ball, get to the rim and he can pass the ball. In college, I played off the ball a lot. Playing off the ball is easier for me to play in transition, get kicks. Playing with Josh is easy for me because I don’t really be needing the ball.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls are 1-10 over their last 11 after Thursday’s loss when they prioritized their veteran guards. Acquiring players such as Dillingham and Ivey and not playing them is another half-measure for Karnisovas and the organization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Back in November, his coaches and teammates knew it would take a while for Lee to get up to speed with all of the Rams’ defensive schemes and offensive sets. The senior had a lot of homework to catch up on. Lee has been faithfully putting that work in, and it started to pay off on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/19/chicago-illinois-high-school-basketball-scores\"   &gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in a packed gym in Gurnee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love to play in big games like this,” Lee said. “This is where I rise up the most. It’s been a lot of learning here, but my teammates trusted me and I trusted myself. I’m just doing whatever the coaches tell me. I’m feeling a lot more comfortable now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strong, mobile guard scored 12 points, grabbed 10 rebounds and sparked DePaul Prep to a 58-54 win against No. 5 Warren in a playoff atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The kid is fearless, which is something we love about him,” Rams guard Rykan Woo said. “He was amazing. We have been waiting for this. We know this is who he is and who he will continue to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren (28-3) was building some momentum early, and the large crowd started to make some noise. Lee shut it down with a three pointer at the end of the first quarter, and then the Rams took control of the game with a 12-0 burst midway through the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woo scored eight in the run and finished with 15 points. Rashaun Porter, a 6-7 senior, led the Rams (26-3) with 16 points and 10 rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Lee] was awesome,” DePaul Prep coach Tom Kleinschmidt said. “We asked a lot of him and he’s coming along great. He’s a beast, physical, and he’s been making shots for us the last six or seven games. And he got us going when we were flat to start.

The junior was 1-for-8 from three-point range. The Blue Devils shot 5 of 24 from three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is not a whole lot you can do about Jaxson,” Woo said. “We did the best we could. We had to make it as hard as we could on him. The coaches did a great job preparing us and our scout team. They don’t get appreciated as much as they should. They played a huge role in this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePaul Prep led 54-42 after a three-point play from Porter with 1:56 left and some fans started to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Warren chipped away and cut the lead to 57-54 on two free throws by Davis with 8 seconds left. That was as close as it would get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With our size we try to make teams beat us on contested twos and take the three away,” Kleinschmidt said. “We wanted to show on Jaxson early. We did a nice job guarding. When they had 22 points at half I was really happy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Braylon Walker led Warren with 20 points and nine rebounds and senior forward Avonn King added 11 points and six rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the final game of the regular season for the Blue Devils. DePaul Prep hosts Ridgewood on Friday. Both teams are among a handful of top contenders for the Class 4A state title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a good game for us,” Blue Devils coach Zack Warren said. “We got better. We needed a tight physical game, we haven’t had many of them this year. We didn’t hit a lot of shots and the margin for error is really small against a team like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-200000\" name=\"html-embed-module-200000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"No Shot Clock, Ep. 202: Breaking down the 3A and 4A state championship contenders\" allowtransparency=\"true\" height=\"150\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);height:150px;\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=2i5vy-1a4a779-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=auto&amp;logo_link=episode_page&amp;btn-skin=c73a3a\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

We fell in love, got married and stayed together for seven years. Things changed; our divorce was amicable. We went on to successful professional lives and happy second marriages. We stayed in touch over the years, mostly through holiday cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I started getting emails from Bobbie about things and ideas we shared together. She lost her husband earlier this year, and I lost my wife about the same time. I stopped by to see her last summer during a visit with some other friends, and we had a nice visit over brunch. She looked good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would I be crazy to see if I could rekindle our relationship after 50 years? She lives a long way away now, but I've thought several times about moving back to the area where I grew up. It's clear we still share the ideals of our youth, and I'll admit I've always had a soft spot for her. I don't have much to offer these days, but I get kind of lonely. — &lt;i&gt;LOOKING BACK IN WYOMING&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR LOOKING BACK:&lt;/b&gt; I don't think it would be crazy at all to explore rekindling your relationship with her, but please take your time. If you want to move back to the area where you grew up, keep that issue separate from the romance. It would be unfortunate if you relocated, things didn't work out as you hoped, you had given up all of your social contacts and you had to start completely over solo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My son married my daughter's best friend, \"Kayla.\" I have loved this young lady since she was a little girl. When Kayla became part of the family, I was overjoyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kayla and my son now have had a baby, and I am not allowed to see the child. The only people who get to see the baby are Kayla's mother and her mother's family. Kayla's parents are divorced, so her father doesn't see his grandchild often either, but it's far more often than my husband and I do. I wrote a text to my son. It wasn't a nice one, but please remember I haven't been able to see my grandchild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know what to do. I'm heartbroken. I did tell them I was sorry and I shouldn't have written what I did, but they still keep me at arm's length. In addition, they have just announced that I'm going to be a grandmother again. I'm not overjoyed about the news, knowing what it's been like with this first child. I'm sure it will be more of the same with the new baby. I love my grandchildren and their parents, but I'm tired of being the bad guy. Advice? — &lt;i&gt;KEPT AWAY IN TENNESSEE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR KEPT AWAY:&lt;/b&gt; It is not unusual for new mothers to gravitate toward their own mothers after the birth of a child. Why do I suspect there may be more to this estrangement than one nasty text written to your son? I wish you had mentioned what may have caused a rift between you and Kayla, whom you say you have loved since she was a little girl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because apologizing to your son and daughter-in-law was not enough to assuage their anger, you are finally going to have to accept that this regrettable situation is one you cannot change on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

After living seven years up North, the citified brothers returned home to the devil they knew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Sinners\" — a movie nominated for a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2026/01/22/sinners-makes-history-setting-oscars-nomination-record\"   &gt;record-breaking 16 Oscars&lt;/a&gt; — is a Jim Crow-era story of allegorical vampires wrapped in blues, sharecropping and spirituality. The film frequently nods to the unseen character Chicago: a Pullman train car in the background, the sweet Buddy Guy cameo and Outfit mob references.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago shaped the Smokestack twins, and so did World War I. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Ain’t you a soldier?\" a shopkeeper challenges a twin in \"Sinners.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I’m a soldier,\" a brother confidently says in another scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veterans like the Smokestacks fought for democracy abroad but found their country hemmed them in second-class citizenry, and that dichotomy sparked a national movement. In the 1920s, scholar &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/alain-locke#:~:text=Alain%20Locke%20(1885%2D1954)%20was%20a%20philosopher%2C%20writer%2C,traveling%20art%20exhibitions%20of%20African%20American%20artists**\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Alain Locke &lt;/a&gt;conceived the term \"New Negro\" to express an understanding of self and agency in the face of racism. The Harlem Renaissance is most closely associated to the period, but that reflected the cultural aspect. New Negro thought spread to other Northern cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-3d0000\" name=\"module-3d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I peeped the New Negro swagger of Smoke and Stack revealed early in the film. During a deal to purchase an old sawmill for a juke joint conversion, the white owner called one of the twins a boy. A twin snapped back that they were grown men, flashing money and bullets. I knew a suspected Ku Klux Klan leader wouldn’t take kindly to that urban uppity attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago’s Black population soared by more than 100,000 from 1920 to 1930, and the twins would have joined an influx of WWI vets settling on the South Side. Scholar&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/JAAHv92n3p347\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt; Chad L. Williams &lt;/a&gt;writes about the racial militancy vets brought to the New Negro ideology: \"Emerging from the war, the New Negro rejected the conservatism, parochialism, and political accommodationism of the 'Old Negro,' a signifier of individual leaders and methods of civil rights protest deemed outdated in the context of the postwar period.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 1919 Chicago race riots, vets used military-style defense of their neighborhoods from white rioters. In 1926, the Victory Monument was erected at 35th and Grand Boulevard in the Black Belt to honor an African American unit that served in France during WWI. It remains there today, the street now King Drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p080104\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“The Rise of Chicago’s Black Metropolis 1920-1929,”&lt;/a&gt; Christopher Robert Reed writes \"the New Negro personality of the 1920s bloomed and grew enormously in terms of an expanded African American worldview, expectations, and accomplishments.\" Chicago represented a place to dream, as migrants transitioned from cotton fields to concrete sidewalks. WWI produced a Black industrial proletariat. Negro women’s clubs worked to advance the race. An upper-class community of doctors, teachers, dentists and social workers expanded. Churches and new political leaders emerged alongside cultural events such as the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/08/09/billiken-parade-black-history-chicago-defender-back-to-school\"   &gt;Bud Billiken Parade&lt;/a&gt;. \"The father of gospel music,\"&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://gospelmusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame-inductees-and-honorees/thomas-a-dorsey\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt; Thomas Dorsey&lt;/a&gt;, entertained migrants who couldn’t afford the club and in 1929 switched piano blues chords for a new gospel sound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Second City ingrained mark on brothers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I imagine Smoke and Stack settled in this new milieu reading the Chicago Defender, purchasing an insurance policy from a Black-owned firm and partying like a scene from an &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.peoriariverfrontmuseum.org/exhibits-collections/exhibits/archibald-motleys-bronzeville-at-night\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Archibald Motley&lt;/a&gt; painting.

At night, the twins headed to South State Street nightclubs on The Stroll. Elsewhere in the Black Belt, the Vendome, Phoenix and Grand Theaters singers &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/ethel-waters/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Ethel Waters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://nmaahc.si.edu/lgbtq/bessie-smith\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Bessie Smith&lt;/a&gt; graced the stages. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/gertrude-ma-rainey\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Ma Rainey&lt;/a&gt; belted blues numbers at the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://cinematreasures.org/theaters/66379\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Monogram Theatre&lt;/a&gt;, a major vaudeville house on 34th and State Street. One hundred years ago this month, educator Carter G. Woodson launched &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://news.uchicago.edu/story/century-black-history-month\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Negro History Week at the Wabash YMCA&lt;/a&gt;. Later that year, on Christmas Day, police raided the Plantation and Sunset clubs for patrons doing a dance called “the black bottom.” Officers also found 20 gallons of liquor. Al Capone’s syndicate controlled those two clubs during Prohibition. Smoke and Stack probably sipped and foot-tapped in their fancy suits before hooking up with his henchmen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Second City made its ingrained mark on the brothers. In \"Sinners,\" Smoke and Stack recall serving in the German trenches and hustling in Chicago gangways, their bond unshakable. One of the last scenes reveals that the former sawmill owner indeed led the KKK. It’s \"getting a little too uppity around here,\" he smirks as he and his racist pals prepare to kill Black juke joint revelers at sunrise. Only Smoke is left, and he ambushes the men, tossing grenades and triggering a machine gun; they never saw the attack coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New Negro brandished his own brand of democracy, courtesy of the WWI tools and skills given to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Natalie Y.

The decrease we’ve seen since the high-water mark during the pandemic is astounding. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/criminal-justice/2025/04/16/chicagos-robbery-surge-is-over\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Starting in July 2024&lt;/a&gt;, Chicago began experiencing a double-digit drop in robberies compared to the year prior.

Fortunately, experts are fairly uniform in their assessment: We invested in communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wesley Skogan, a professor emeritus at Northwestern University who analyzes crime numbers, attributed the drop to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/criminal-justice/2025/04/16/chicagos-robbery-surge-is-over\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;the more frequent use of violence interruption programs and fully functional youth and recreational services&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-cc0000\" name=\"module-cc0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Commentary bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commentary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally recognized crime data analyst Jeff Asher likewise &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://jasher.substack.com/p/why-i-think-murder-is-plunging\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;theorizes that&lt;/a&gt;, “a strong investment in communities from private and public sources after the shock of the pandemic stands out as a major cause” of the decrease in homicides.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes money spent on infrastructure, violence intervention, job support and supporting communities. Some of the money came from state and local investments, and some from the federal government. Unfortunately, President Donald Trump is now rolling back many of these investments and using U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Border Patrol and the threat of the National Guard to destabilize our communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We cannot forget that we now have a blueprint for community safety that is worth pursuing. Unlike jail and prison, these community investments actually address the root causes of crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as our investments are working, some want to return to the failed “lock 'em up” policies that created mass incarceration but didn’t create safety. Trump has made a concerted effort to take credit for our success in Illinois, saying that decreases in crime — which significantly predate the federal government's invasion — are due to its reign of terror and kidnapping residents off the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as decreases in crime started long before Trump’s invasion, decreases in crime started long before the new Cook County state’s attorney took office. Crime started falling in 2023 from its COVID-19 high, and the trends in Chicago &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://jasher.substack.com/p/why-i-think-murder-is-plunging\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;mirror those we see across the country&lt;/a&gt;. This, of course, suggests that the professors and data analysts are right: Something else is afoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also know that increased jailing actually leads to negative public safety consequences long term. Studies have repeatedly shown that even &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/security=policy:eyJleHBpcnkiOjQwNzg3NjQwMDAsImNhbGwiOlsicGljayIsInJlYWQiLCJ3cml0ZSIsIndyaXRlVXJsIiwic3RvcmUiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwicmVtb3ZlIiwicnVuV29ya2Zsb3ciXX0=,signature:9df63ee50143fbd862145c8fb4ed2fcc17d068183103740b1212c4c9bc858f63/NPfbpQtCQzyQFam13VLU\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;short periods of pretrial jailing increase the likelihood that someone will be arrested again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no coincidence that the decrease in crime has coincided with the number of people jailed awaiting trial decreasing over the last decade. It’s because ensuring as many people as possible are home awaiting trial has long-term, positive consequences. People are able to keep their jobs, family and community connections and housing while awaiting their day in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When implemented, the Pretrial Fairness Act ended the use of money bond in 2023. We ensured that families would no longer have to choose between paying the rent or paying ransom to secure the constitutional right to the presumption of innocence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judges are now receiving more information and spending more time on decisions regarding pretrial release and detention. And most importantly, the law is working. In Cook County, the vast majority of people on pretrial release are succeeding. In the two years since the Pretrial Fairness Act took effect, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ocj-web-files.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/documents/2025-12-27_OCJ_PFA_Dashboard_New_Layout_25.12.15_FINAL.pdf?VersionId=SB34JEQ_HSHWWp197pKXbqCLujcAOTng\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;94% of the more than 130,000 people released pretrial have not been charged with new offenses against a person&lt;/a&gt;, according to summary data compiled by staff at the Cook County chief judge's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We must not lose sight of what works. In 2023, in addition to ending money bond, opening back up our schools, recreation centers and public gathering spaces, we started investing in programs that have been shown to actually protect safety: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2025/april/20-Mil-Violence-Intervention-Grant.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;community violence interruption programs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/03/06/illinois-opioid-drug-overdose-deaths\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;substance use disorder treatment and harm reduction programs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicagohealthonline.com/change-makers/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;hospital-based violence intervention programs&lt;/a&gt; that support the people most affected by gun violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These investments and reforms to our criminal legal system are working. It would be a mistake to allow politicians who are focused on advancing their careers at the expense of our communities to allow us to return to the failed “public safety” policies of the past. It takes a long time for root-cause solutions to show results, and we are finally seeing the effect here in Chicago and nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Illinois state Rep.

The hands of classmates were bound with tape to symbolize chains. The teacher said that students with bound hands would be “shipped off in a cage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When his mother contacted the school, both principal and teacher denied that the reenactment took place. They were saying, in effect, that her son was lying. More anger for the mother. More distress for the son. Now he was forced to insist to his mother that he was telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This fine young son of Juanyea and Alexis has been traumatized. He is nervous about going to sleep. In his dreams men are chasing him. He needs healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could someone do something, as retired TV newsman &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2026/02/10/phil-ponce-retired-chicago-tonight-host-video-latino-ice-agents\"   &gt;Phil Ponce&lt;/a&gt; has urged on another front? Could someone contact Barack Obama and ask him to send a letter of comfort? Maybe the family could be invited to the opening of the Obama Presidential Center. Maybe the positive experience of meeting a former president — the first Black president — would erase the bad dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe Obama and this boy could toss a football back and forth at the center's &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/architecture-design/2025/12/08/obama-presidential-center-home-court-building-opened-exclusive-look\"   &gt;Home Court&lt;/a&gt;, and Chicago Public Media could film it.

Many small restaurants cannot afford a delivery driver or have the ability to deliver within very short distances. I too live in Lincoln Park and find that those little robots are probably more polite than the residents who choose to have strollers larger than SUVs taking up all the room or ride electric bikes and scooters at alarming speeds on the sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those robots are keeping small businesses alive, and while they should not be allowed to overpopulate the sidewalks, they should be allowed to travel on them. We share the roads with bicycles. Why not share the sidewalk with delivery bots? As it says on their little electronic sign, the robots are \"on the job.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mary von Goeben, Lincoln Park&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Peas in a pod&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow!

The Humboldt Park resident paid the balance through the now-defunct platform PayUSAtax, which was linked on the IRS website and listed as an authorized payment provider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people have complained online about PayUSAtax, which was operated by Value Payment Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Better Business Bureau has logged 294 complaints about Value Payment Systems' parent company, Catalis, over the last three years, though it reports a drop-off to 21 complaints in the last 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Johnson, executive vice president at Georgia-based Catalis, said the complaints represent a small fraction of its transactions, and most of the issues with PayUSAtax stemmed from mistyped numbers or names, or Social Security numbers and names that don't correspond, in the case of tax returns filed jointly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Occasionally, there's one that falls through the cracks,\" Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Byrne logged into the IRS website, he saw his payment status was pending. Since the money had already been charged to his credit card — along with a convenience fee of $17.82 — he figured the IRS was slow in crediting the funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, the pending status disappeared, but his account showed he still owed the IRS $979, plus interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Byrne said the IRS told him to contact PayUSAtax, who said they couldn't help and referred him back to the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By early 2025, Byrne was still trying to get his PayUSAtax payment processed by the IRS. Meanwhile, he filed his 2024 federal tax return, only for the IRS to seize almost half of his $2,561 refund.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"They claimed that they could not see a pending payment of $979, and there was no evidence I ever made a payment of that amount and that I owed the $1,057.32 that they removed from my refund,\" Byrne said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He tried, unsuccessfully, to also dispute the PayUSAtax charge with his credit card issuer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I felt helpless, actually,\" Byrne said. \"No one was giving me any answers.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Sun-Times asked Catalis about Byrne's problem last summer, and the company said it would contact the IRS and try to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catalis determined Byrne didn't make any errors, and by October, it heard from the IRS that the payment \"was located [and] was unpostable.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IRS spokesperson said in a statement in January that \"some transactions, payments and returns cannot post to the master file due to programming checks for specific conditions. These conditions generate 'unpostables' that may require review and resolution determination.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS found the payment around the time of the government shutdown, which lasted from Oct. 1 through Nov. 12, affecting some IRS activities. Finally, in mid-December, the IRS sent Byrne a refund check — for $1,105.42, which included interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-8e0000\" name=\"image-8e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/00d0bb0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F15%2F9c4d9d224c8cbb57f5015b132944%2Ftaxpayusa-260222-4.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3b7dc37/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F15%2F9c4d9d224c8cbb57f5015b132944%2Ftaxpayusa-260222-4.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a69b1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F15%2F9c4d9d224c8cbb57f5015b132944%2Ftaxpayusa-260222-4.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Humboldt Park resident Brendan Byrne walks by a metal fence.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a69b1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F15%2F9c4d9d224c8cbb57f5015b132944%2Ftaxpayusa-260222-4.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/41aca3c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F15%2F9c4d9d224c8cbb57f5015b132944%2Ftaxpayusa-260222-4.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a69b1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5d%2F15%2F9c4d9d224c8cbb57f5015b132944%2Ftaxpayusa-260222-4.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humboldt Park resident Brendan Byrne, said he felt “helpless” as he spent nearly two years trying to straighten out a botched tax payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;PayUSAtax would send funds to the IRS \"almost instantaneously,\" but if there was a problem, the IRS would be responsible for straightening out the issue, Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said complaints about poor customer service  were due in part to a lag in federal background checks for about two dozen extra call center workers Catalis was trying to hire in 2023. The company also created a new system in December 2023 to help taxpayers more easily check on the status of their payments, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, PayUSAtax processed about 6 million transactions, totaling about $10 billion. Johnson said the company estimated \"less than 0.1%\" of transactions had problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PayUSAtax shuttered in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson said Catalis got out of the federal tax payments business and is no longer an IRS vendor. Catalis focuses on providing software and processing payments for local governments collecting taxes, parking violation fees, child support payments and other bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS still uses third-party payment processors for taxpayers who are using their debit or credit card. The companies, Pay1040 and ACI Payments, each charge a card processing fee at rates dependent on the payment type. For example, credit card transaction fees can range from 1.75% to 1.85%.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.irs.gov/payments\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;ways to pay&lt;/a&gt; your federal income tax includes mailing a check or money order, same-day wire or direct pay, which draws the money from the taxpayer's bank account for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS also allows certain filers to apply for a payment plan, though some may charge a user fee, which can be reduced, waived or reimbursed depending on a taxpayer's income. &lt;/p&gt;",

He said he was a gold miner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, officers on a drug task force had taken his luggage from an Amtrak train at Union Station in Chicago. Inside was $115,000 in cash. To them it was the usual thing. A one-way ticket. A suitcase full of bills. A long trip across the country. They had seen it before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ross said the money came from the ground. He worked claims in Oregon and California. He said he pulled gold from the earth and sold it, and this was the return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyer, Stephen Komie, knew how it sounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one was going to believe it unless we could prove it,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Ross brought him some rock solid evidence: a gold nugget, dull and heavy, small enough to sit in the palm. He said he had dug it out himself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komie carried it into federal court and set it down before the judge, U.S. District Judge Robert Dow. The judge picked it up. He turned it in his hand and looked at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Judge Dow examined the gold,” Komie says. “And that was the end of any question that he was a gold miner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late January, the government agreed to give the money back. There was no apology. Nothing on the record to say why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ross, the loss had cut deep, Komie says. He went without the money for about seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Mining takes tools. It takes chemicals and fuel. It takes trucks and long drives into rough country. Without money, there is no work. It was catastrophic,\" Komie says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. attorney's office in Chicago declined to comment on the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-db0000\" name=\"image-db0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/50595ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F87%2F69%2F4fc90033484e8149c3f7cac03811%2Fkomie-gold.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/06ff87d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F87%2F69%2F4fc90033484e8149c3f7cac03811%2Fkomie-gold.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1aac82e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F87%2F69%2F4fc90033484e8149c3f7cac03811%2Fkomie-gold.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Lawyer Stephen Komie holds a gold nugget in the palm of his hand.

The law allows officers to take money and property they believe is tied to crime. They do not have to arrest anyone. They do not have to file charges. The owner must go to court and try to win it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ross’s money was taken through the Drug Enforcement Administration’s Transportation Interdiction Program. For years, agents and local police have worked airports, train stations and bus terminals. They watched travelers. They asked questions. They searched bags for drugs and for cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the Justice Department’s inspector general looked at 100 cash seizures made through the program. Most, a report said, were carried out without any prior intelligence about a specific drug crime. Many did not lead to arrests. The watchdog said DEA could not tell whether the seizures risked civil liberties, moved investigations forward or stopped crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2024, the inspector general weighed in again. A memo spoke of poor training in the program. It described a traveler who missed his flight after agents searched his bag. They found no drugs. They found no cash. The stop had begun with a tip from an airline employee. The employee had received tens of thousands of dollars from the DEA for information about passengers thought to be suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memo prompted the attorney general’s office under President Joe Biden to suspend the program in November 2024. The DEA terminated it in January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"For some airline workers, tipping off the DEA pays off big\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;For some airline workers, tipping off the DEA pays off big&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-980000\" name=\"image-980000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/989d469/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5a%2Fe5%2F9e847bb14c73a0c0f06345442d36%2Funionstation-072325-016.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4182549/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5a%2Fe5%2F9e847bb14c73a0c0f06345442d36%2Funionstation-072325-016.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/482b499/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5a%2Fe5%2F9e847bb14c73a0c0f06345442d36%2Funionstation-072325-016.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The renovated Great Hall in Union Station at 225 S.

Some of the judges say we’re just acting on a hunch, but we do have strong reasonable suspicion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the future of the Transportation Interdiction Program is not settled. After Donald Trump returned to office, Drug Enforcement Administration lawyers told the courts the agency might revive some version of it. They spoke of more training. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without the program, officers are allowed to take cash at airports and stations if it is tied to an active criminal investigation, the attorney general’s office had said when the 2024 suspension was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The money involved is considerable. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2024, U.S. attorneys reported more than half a billion dollars in civil asset forfeitures across the country. The Northern District of Illinois ranked third in total value, behind the Central District of California and the District of Columbia. More than $60 million was reported in the Chicago region alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, the DEA accounts for about 80% of civil asset forfeitures, according to the inspector general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;How the stops worked&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Union Station and at O’Hare and Midway airports, agents from the DEA worked with local police on a task force called Group 24. They read passenger lists. They studied ticket records. In their reports, they wrote about one-way tickets bought close to departure, about cash payments, about third-party credit cards. These were signs, they said, of drug couriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They approached travelers for what they called consensual interviews. In the reports, the traveler was often described as nervous. The agents asked for permission to search the luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the traveler said no, as Ross did, the agents could call for a dog trained to detect drugs. If the dog alerted, that was enough to take the bags and hold them while they sought a warrant to open them. Travelers were given a receipt and went on their way without their luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the property back, owners had to file a claim in federal court. Sometimes that meant coming back to Chicago at their  own expense, to stand before a judge and say the money was theirs and not the government’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e40000\" name=\"image-e40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d0cb975/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1c%2F75%2Fec1cd42245dc94aab602d858444a%2Fkomie-office.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/54daa62/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1c%2F75%2Fec1cd42245dc94aab602d858444a%2Fkomie-office.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7092d19/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1c%2F75%2Fec1cd42245dc94aab602d858444a%2Fkomie-office.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Lawyer Stephen Komie in his Loop office.

At shows and small exchanges, raw minerals change hands for bills counted out on folding tables. Gold dust. Flakes. Nuggets wrapped in cotton gauze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says the agents ignored obvious evidence about Ross that should have cut against their suspicions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside Ross’s luggage was a bill of sale. It listed “gold dust, pickers, flakes and nuggets weighing 88.5 ounces from southern Oregon mining claims.” Ross was named as the seller. Records from the Bureau of Land Management show he holds mining claims in Oregon and California, Komie says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the government might have been more focused on other information: Ross also had an ownership interest in a recreational marijuana dispensary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for a drug-detection dog’s alert on Ross’s money, Komie calls it thin proof. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies and media experiments have long suggested that a significant portion of circulating U.S. currency carries trace amounts of narcotics residue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a widely cited 1985 test arranged by the Miami Herald, dogs alerted to bills carried by public figures including a future attorney general, Janet Reno, and a future Florida governor, Jeb Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Money passes through many hands. It carries what it has touched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tilted scales&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odds of getting seized money back are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal report once estimated that only about 5% of owners succeed in reclaiming their property. In many cases, no one files a claim at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some travelers may have been involved in crime and decided they were fortunate not to be arrested. They let the money go and did not invite more attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others may have done the math. A lawyer costs money. Time costs money. A trip back to court costs money. For some, the fight would cost more than what was taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the cash stays with the government, and the suitcase does not come home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-e90000\" name=\"module-e90000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Some of Chicago’s civil forfeiture losers — and their alibis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\" id=\"rte-146f20a0-0ce4-11f1-abcf-d7bfe8cf2af5\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2005, a woman said she was taking $15,000 to her sick aunt in Mexico. DEA task force officers found money order receipts in her luggage for inmates locked up in federal prison. She forfeited the money seized at the Amtrak terminal at Union Station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2015, a man said he was taking $330,000 to Oregon to buy racing pigeons and a car. He forfeited the money seized at Union Station.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also in 2015, a man said he was traveling with $76,480 he used to service ATM machines. He never filed a claim for the money seized at O’Hare Airport, and the money was forfeited.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komie calls himself the “Dean of Forfeitures” on his firm’s website. He has made a practice of fighting these seizures. It's steady work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A review of 20 Chicago cases he has handled since 1992 shows he often gets at least something back for his clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven recovered all their money. The total was $864,000. One was a salesman from China who carried $294,000 in cash through Union Station after attending a jade show in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine others settled. Prosecutors returned $357,000 and kept $638,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four lost everything. Together, they forfeited $257,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them was Nicholas Marrocco. He fought for 15 years. In 2018, a federal appeals court ruled against him. He lost $101,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says many lawyers will not take smaller cases on contingency. The money is not enough to justify the risk. And many criminal defense attorneys do not know the narrow rules and strict deadlines that govern forfeiture law. It is its own kind of fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The scale is tilted in the government’s favor,” Komie says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2016/4/18/18404540/13-years-later-man-s-war-with-u-s-over-shoebox-cash-rages-on\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;13 years later, man’s war with U.S. over ‘shoebox’ cash rages on&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2016/4/18/18360688/government-shouldn-t-seize-assets-without-greater-proof-of-crime\n\n\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Government shouldn’t seize assets without greater proof of crime&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e60000\" name=\"image-e60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/da1077b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1986x1115+0+96/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff7%2F73%2F1eb93ee340dbb415875d484f64be%2F11-5-white-henry-hyde-3-1.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1b1bcfa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1986x1115+0+96/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff7%2F73%2F1eb93ee340dbb415875d484f64be%2F11-5-white-henry-hyde-3-1.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a7cf349/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1986x1115+0+96/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff7%2F73%2F1eb93ee340dbb415875d484f64be%2F11-5-white-henry-hyde-3-1.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The late U.S. Rep.

Agencies that seize assets can keep the proceeds, using them to buy vehicles, equipment and other items. State and local departments can share in the funds if they participate in federal task forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Police Department has been among the agencies benefiting from federal forfeitures. In 2021, the Justice Department’s inspector general criticized the department for lacking adequate policies to track how it spent those funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say allowing agencies to keep what they seize creates what the late U.S. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., once called “contingent fee law enforcement.” In 1996, as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, he held hearings questioning the constitutionality of civil cash seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are confronted in Illinois with a system that has run amok,” Hyde said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komie testified at Hyde’s hearings. He warned that forfeited cash could be spent with little oversight from elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courts, too, have expressed concern over the years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1997, Judge William Bauer wrote for the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals that a Chicago pizzeria owner should get back more than $500,000 seized from him by Chicago police officers and \"adopted\" by the federal government for civil forfeiture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We reiterate that the government may not seize money, even half a million dollars, based on its bare assumption that most people do not have huge sums of money lying about, and if they do, they must be involved in narcotics trafficking or some other sinister activity,\" Bauer said, adding, \"As has likely been obvious from the tone of this opinion, we believe the government's conduct in forfeiture cases leaves much to be desired.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, an Illinois appellate court ordered the return of $280,000 seized from a Canadian traveler at Union Station. Chicago cops seized the money more than a decade earlier. The court held that purchasing a one-way train ticket in cash less than 24 hours before departure, standing alone, did not establish probable cause to search luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Komie represented the claimants in both cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legislative and legal challenges&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Capitol Hill, lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle have have tried and failed to tighten the rules in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their latest effort, U.S. Sens. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., have sponsored the FAIR Act, which would require the federal government to meet a higher burden of proof before permanently taking property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pending legislation would also direct forfeited funds to the U.S. Treasury rather than to law enforcement agencies, reducing what supporters describe as a financial incentive to seize assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar bill is expected to be introduced in the House on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Stories about a grocer in Michigan, a restaurant owner in Iowa and farmers in Maryland have all exposed government overreach within the civil asset forfeiture process,\" a sponsor, U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., said in a statement. \"We must put the presumption of innocence back where it belongs, on the side of the American people.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meantime, the debate over civil asset forfeiture is playing out in Pittsburgh, Pa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawsuit filed there in 2020 challenges a DEA seizure of $82,373 from a Pennsylvania man who said the money represented his life savings. A woman from Florida and a man from California joined him. Their cash had been taken at airports as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are asking a federal judge to stop the agency from making those kinds of seizures in the future. They want the case to proceed as a class action for other travelers who say their money was taken the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DEA says the dispute is moot. It canceled the program last year, the agency says, and there is nothing left to challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in court filings, its lawyers did not rule out bringing back the Transportation Interdiction Program with some changes. The agency declined to answer questions about those filings.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DEA continuously evaluates the effectiveness of its investigatory techniques and adapts in accordance with the law,” an agency spokesperson said, referring the Sun-Times to the Justice Department “for information related to future policies under the Administration.”   &lt;/p&gt;",

For joint filers, the amount has increased to $30 million. The individual limit has tripled from $5 million in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will the increased exemption affect you? Most Americans will not be affected, at least not directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new policy amounts to an estimated $5.7 million tax cut for the wealthiest residents, or 1 in 1000 estates, who glean the majority of their income from investments. In 2026, there are about 4,000 estates that exceed the exemption amount. By contrast, the average wealth transfer from baby boomers to their heirs is expected to fall short of $335,000 over the next 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The primary effect of the tax change on most people is the federal government's larger deficit and the likely need to raise taxes or cut spending in the future,\" certified financial planner and estate planning attorney Ari Weisbard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increased exemption is estimated to raise the national deficit by more than $212 billion over the next 10 years. For lower-income Americans, the massive increase in the estate tax exemption in recent years can be felt in the form of decreased revenue for public services such as Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and federal student loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the limited few who may leave behind enough assets to surpass the exemption limit, careful tax planning is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"First, get very clear on your net worth, as the IRS imposes the tax on all assets, including your home, retirement accounts and business interests and even the death benefit of your life insurance,\" Todd Villarrubia, tax lawyer and founding partner of Wealth Planning Law Group, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to amounts that surpass the exemption limit, a progressive federal tax rate of 18% to 40% will apply. So for an inheritance of $20 million from an individual benefactor, the heir could be taxed up to 40% on the $5 million that surpasses the federal exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that said, estate taxes can still be reduced or even avoided altogether through strategic tax planning, including the use of trusts, charitable giving and portability, which gives married individuals the option to transfer the unused portion of their exemption to their surviving spouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who want to leave assets behind but fall far short of the exemption amount, there are still reasons to pay attention to the changes and consider updating your tax strategy. For example, if you live in a state with an estate tax exemption that's far lower than the federal threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The Illinois tax has a much lower exemption than the federal system,\" Villarubia said. \"So families can owe Illinois tax even when no federal estate taxes are due.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state's exemption remains at $4 million, where it was set in 2014. For assets that surpass that level, a state tax rate of 0.8% to 16% can apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like federal taxpayers, Illinoisans can use gifting and trusts to shield them from estate taxes for over-limit assets. However, Weisbard advised proceeding with caution, since the state tax rate is much lower than the federal rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois residents should also keep in mind that the value of their assets is calculated differently for state versus federal taxes. For those reasons, it's best to seek guidance from a qualified tax adviser or estate-planning attorney familiar with Illinois tax policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another group that should take heed of the change is high net worth taxpayers who could have more valuable assets to pass on in the future. Even if you fall short of the limit today, consider the possibility that the future returns on your investments could push the value of your total assets beyond the federal or state exemption levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you come close to the new exemption amount or not, it's wise to occasionally revisit your estate planning strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Many households with estate plans from many years ago have complicated living trusts and other arrangements that made sense when the estate tax exemption was much lower than it is today,\" Weisbard said. \"These households should consult their attorney about revising their plans to make them simpler and avoid the negative capital gains tax consequences of these estate tax avoidance strategies that are no longer necessary.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

In return, users receive more of the crypto that was staked, similar to the benefits of interest-bearing bank accounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Airdrop is when a new crypto project launches and sends out free tokens to a select group, often as part of a broader marketing effort for the new currency. Receiving these coins count as a taxable event when the recipient is able to use or access the currency, according to TurboTax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using crypto to buy goods and services also creates a taxable event, just like selling it for cash, according to Mark Gallegos, tax partner at Porte Brown’s Elgin office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So everyday transactions, like buying a cup of coffee with crypto, can technically create a tax reporting obligation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How long a filer held their crypto before selling or exchanging it can determine its tax rate, similar to how investments are taxed by the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you owned the currency for one year or less before spending or selling it, any profits are typically considered short-term capital gains, taxed at your ordinary income rate that could be between 10% and 37%. If you held it for more than one year, profits are typically long-term capital gains that are subject to tax rates at either 0%, 15% or 20%, according to TurboTax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital transactions, including crypto, should be reported on Form 8949, where taxpayers must report personal sales, trades and crypto positions, including acquisition and sales dates, proceeds, cost basis and the resulting gain or loss. The tally is documented on Schedule D, which summarizes your overall capital gains or losses for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For other income, such as interest earned or staking earnings, these are reported by taxpayers on Schedule B or Schedule 1, said Curt Mastio, managing partner at Chicago-based Founder’s CPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you received crypto as income, it's taxed by the IRS as ordinary income based on the fair market value at the time you were paid. And you must report the funds on your return, even if you didn't receive a Form 1099-NEC or W-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you dispose of or sell digital assets, you generally subtract your basis [or fair market value at purchase] from the fair market value at disposition to compute gain or loss,” Mastio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a filer isn't keeping track of each transaction's capital gains or losses, it can become difficult to untangle when tax season arrives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, the IRS may still have ways of tracking your crypto activity, according to TurboTax. Some exchanges that provide filers Form 1099-B will report client trades to the IRS. The federal agency also uses blockchain analytics tools to identify the crypto activity of digital wallets, especially to help spot suspected tax evasion or money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 2026 tax year, crypto brokers and exchanges are required to issue clients a Form 1099-DA, or the Digital Asset Proceeds From Broker Transactions form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It will catch a lot of people by surprise ... when it goes into effect,” Slettengren said. “In essence, the IRS knows your crypto holdings and it is time to start paying your taxes now if you have not reported in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For taxes due in April, service providers like Coinbase or Robinhood were only required to report sales during the calendar year on Form 1099-DA but that stipulation changed on Jan. 1, according to Brian Kearns, founder of Haddam Road Advisors in Evanston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Starting in 2026, custodians will also need to provide basis information for gains and losses for crypto assets,” he said. “If your crypto is not held by a custodian, you alone are responsible for reporting gains and losses and for calculating the requisite tax.”&lt;/p&gt;",

And the deduction is available to filers who take the standard deduction or itemize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new senior deduction is also on top of the extra standard deduction of $2,000 for single filers, or $1,600 per qualifying individual for married joint filers, aged 65 or older. That extra deduction increases by $50 for the 2026 tax year, or returns due in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior deduction may bring some much needed relief to taxpayers grappling with inflation at the grocery store and increased health care and housing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tax Foundation estimates that on average, each household with a qualifying senior will see a roughly $780 increase in their take-home pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the nonprofit said low-income retirees will likely miss out because they already benefit from the standard and extra $2,000 deduction, and their tax liability is close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 2025 tax year, the standard deduction is $15,750, or $31,500 for married filing jointly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior deduction phases out at a 6% rate for taxpayers with a modified adjusted gross income over $75,000, or $150,000 for joint filers. Single filers with an income above $175,000 and married filers with an income above $250,000 are ineligible for the tax deduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the deduction is supposed to provide some relief for eligible seniors, it may not have an impact on deciding whether to itemize or claim the standard deduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of seniors are probably taking the standard deduction [versus itemizing] … just because it’s so high. For 2025, if you’re filing jointly, the standard deduction is $31,500, which is a really huge amount. On top of that, there is an additional standard deduction for senior citizens, and then, on top of that, there’s this new enhanced deduction for seniors,” Shaun Hunley, tax expert and executive editor at Thomson Reuters, said in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They could get up to $46,700 when combining all three deductions. That’s a huge amount, so I would say, overall, most seniors are probably taking the standard deduction, unless they have high medical expenses, because that’s an itemized deduction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Illinois seniors, the deduction wouldn’t apply to their state income tax return. That’s because the senior deduction is a “below-the-line” deduction, meaning it’s reported after your adjusted gross income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois taxable income starts from the federal adjusted gross income, which means the senior deduction wouldn’t be factored into the AGI reported on your state return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greg Mermel, certified public accountant and partner at Chicago-based Mermel-Goldman CPAs, said many Illinois filers may not even notice the absence of the $6,000 deduction because the state doesn’t tax Social Security, pension or retirement plan income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It really only benefits middle-income taxpayers because people who are just scraping by on Social Security — who there are far too many in America — are not paying taxes anyway,” Mermel said.&lt;/p&gt;",

Among the other linguistic items are boarding school materials that were translated into Dakota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of these materials provide an important connection to the past and an important connection to ancestors,” Miron said. “I have seen people in the collection weep upon seeing something that is related to their family, or is related to their community that they've never seen before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tribal nations can also request digitization of other parts of the collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mellon funds will also be used to hire three additional staff members, including a second dedicated librarian for the Indigenous collection. Additionally, the dollars will go toward fellowships for people who work for tribal nations, travel for tribal members to visit the collection and for librarians to visit tribal nations. Some grant funds are intended, too, for compensation for tribal members who help the library review items in the collection and for in-depth projects with partner tribal nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, Newberry says, more than half the funds will go directly to tribal nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We fundamentally believe that tribal nations are the best representatives of their own history,” said Miron, adding that the library is also open to repatriating items in its collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-530000\" name=\"image-530000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72632ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+226/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2F54%2F807dc9ad43ac8426afb9fbd38151%2F3-schoolcraft-ayer-e77-s41-plt-60-o3-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1cc879c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+226/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2F54%2F807dc9ad43ac8426afb9fbd38151%2F3-schoolcraft-ayer-e77-s41-plt-60-o3-1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1b95896/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+226/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2F54%2F807dc9ad43ac8426afb9fbd38151%2F3-schoolcraft-ayer-e77-s41-plt-60-o3-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Symbolic Petition of the Cippewa Chiefs\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1b95896/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+226/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2F54%2F807dc9ad43ac8426afb9fbd38151%2F3-schoolcraft-ayer-e77-s41-plt-60-o3-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/994381e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+226/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2F54%2F807dc9ad43ac8426afb9fbd38151%2F3-schoolcraft-ayer-e77-s41-plt-60-o3-1.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1b95896/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+226/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4a%2F54%2F807dc9ad43ac8426afb9fbd38151%2F3-schoolcraft-ayer-e77-s41-plt-60-o3-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This image, part of Newberry’s collection, represents the clans of the ogimaag (chiefs) of the Lake Superior bands of Ojibwe.

Ayer, whom Miron said was an avid collector of books, manuscripts, artwork and publications about different tribal nations. Ayer also endowed the collection, and that has allowed the Newberry to grow the collection over the years and dedicate a librarian to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Miron said, the approach to expanding this collection has shifted to “prioritizing materials created by Native people rather than just materials about Native people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest round of Mellon funding is an extension of a previous planning grant, which the museum received in 2020. The planning process resulted in the “&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/curious-city/2024/11/21/indigenous-chicago-project-shows-the-city-has-always-been-a-native-place\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Indigenous Chicago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” project, which looks to provide information and resources on Chicago’s historic and modern-day Indigenous communities. It includes interactive online maps that reinterpret Chicago’s history from Native American perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project comes amid other recent local efforts to better recognize Indigenous people and their culture. A new partnership between the American Indian Center of Chicago and the Forest Preserve of Kane County led to the introduction of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/environment/2026/01/23/burlington-prairie-bison-herd-kane-county-illinois-native-americans\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a new bison herd&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the animals to the local tallgrass prairie for the first time in 200 years. The center will steward the herd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her role at the library, Miron said she is conscious of the way institutions like Newberry have contributed to pain inflicted upon Indigenous communities. “As an institution that has benefited from colonialism, I really see it as our job to try to undo some of that harm and to really return control to tribal nations,” Miron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grant work is now underway and will continue through December 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Courtney Kueppers is an arts and culture reporter at WBEZ.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Either way, the matter lands with a top administrator at the state’s financial and professional regulation department for a final decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators don’t need to prove the allegations against Dobrescu, only that another jurisdiction took “adverse action” against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"

graduate of Northwestern University and raised in Munster, Indiana, Dobrescu has portrayed the central allegations against him in Alaska as “false,” saying the investigator’s affidavit was rife with misinformation and laid the mistakes of others on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the complaining doctors alleged that Dobrescu “used a nonstandard strategy of transecting the aorta entirely to gain access to the aortic valve, which led to significant bleeding that Dr. Dobrescu was unable to remedy,” according to the affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dobrescu “was confronted with the severe bleeding from his suture lines,” he persisted “in a failing strategy of adding stitches... and refused to perform hypothermic circulatory arrest despite repeated recommendations to do so,” according to the affidavit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaining doctor said that “in efforts to repair the bleeding that Dr. Dobrescu had caused, Dr. Dobrescu inadvertently perforated the pulmonary artery,” the affidavit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dobrescu has, in turn, pointed blame for the outcome of the surgery on one of the complaining doctors, an anesthesiologist, who Dobrescu alleged “did not replace blood products correctly” as the patient bled out, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anesthesiologist has insisted he acted properly, and an administrative law judge in Alaska concluded in 2025 that “the evidence is too ambiguous to make a clear finding on whether there were departures from the standard of care in the final administration of blood products,” records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge also seemed to find no major fault in how Dobrescu performed the surgery, writing: “Fundamentally, the demonstrated problem with this surgery is not its execution, but instead that it probably should not have been occurring in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge hammered Dobrescu for forging ahead with an operation not deemed urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"

surgery on December 7 overlooked important risk factors” — including “poor” diabetes control in the patient — “as did his downstream failure to reconsider up to the hour of surgery,” the judge wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The decision-making process fell below the standard of care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge wrote that the patient’s death “was substantially related to the substandard pre-operative risk evaluation,” and that after “losing a patient in this manner, the licensee” — Dobrescu — “exhibited deeply irresponsible behavior by failing to provide an operative report.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dobrescu said he was “put in an impossible position” because his lawyer advised not to immediately release that report due to  concerns it would be used to help prosecute him for negligent homicide, though a criminal case never materialized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An autopsy could have provided more clarity over the man’s death, but for reasons still unclear one wasn’t conducted initially and wasn’t possible later because the patient had been cremated, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge’s ruling also found regulators had “proven” that Dobrescu “obtained licensure in Alaska by fraud” by failing to reveal on his paperwork that he “was under active investigation in Virginia” administratively “for incompetence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dobrescu argued that a consultant he’d hired to complete the application advised that the Virginia investigation — which examined his personal and professional conduct in a number of states — didn’t need to be disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alaska patient’s daughter testified at Alaska’s administrative hearing that she was there when her father was wheeled into surgery, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hugged him, and I kissed him, and I told him to do good,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And he said, ‘Don't tell me. Tell them to do good.’”&lt;/p&gt;",

What's normal in the city's majority-Latino communities today isn't what it was before Operation Midway Blitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Southeast Side, long defined by steel mills and working-class communities, was one of the first places Mexicans came to Chicago more than a century ago. On the Lower West Side, Pilsen stands out for its colorful murals, rich arts and culinary scene and lively Mexican American culture. Farther southwest, Little Village, also known as La Villita, has a vibrant commercial corridor and community celebrations like the Mexican Independence Day parade that are among the oldest and largest in the Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neighborhoods carved separate paths to becoming majority-Latino and cultural centers for Mexican communities in Chicago. But they shared a common experience last fall: the Trump administration's Operation Midway Blitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/live/2025/09/16/cbp-raids-ice-chicago-elgin-operation-at-large\"   &gt;The immigration enforcement campaign began Sept. 16,&lt;/a&gt; Mexican Independence Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal officials said the operation targeted violent criminals without legal status, though &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/03/28/tren-de-aragua-venezuela-gang-trump-tom-homan-terrorism-violence-crime-chicago-colombia-honduras-ecuador-nicolas-maduro-salvador\"   &gt;this proved largely untrue&lt;/a&gt;. As enforcement increased, fear spread across Chicago and its suburbs. Latino and immigrant-majority neighborhoods, including Pilsen, Little Village and the Southeast Side, went on high alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These communities developed their Latino identities over generations, shaped by migration, labor and displacement.

Many arrived in 1919, when they were recruited during a national steel mill strike. These communities became part of the backbone of heavily industrial South Chicago and the East Side, creating an identity that endures today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1923, the community established Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, the first Mexican American parish in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 2023, Latinos on the East Side and South Chicago made up half of the neighborhoods’ 52,000 residents, according to the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. The East Side alone is nearly 90% Latino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stories from South Chicago and the Southeast Side&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sc-masa\"   &gt;Cecy’s Molino de Masa&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sc-maria\"   &gt;Maria&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#ses-natg\"   &gt;Illinois National Guard member&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sc-pedraza\"   &gt;Corina Pedraza&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#ses-bautista\"   &gt;Olga Bautista&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"pilsen-top\" name=\"pilsen-top\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c107295/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/efbfe2a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53a3f35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Maria Ruiz and Rita sit atop a car in the Mexican Independence Day Parade as it travels down East 91st Street on the Southeast Side on Sept. 15, 1957.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53a3f35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2efd0e4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53a3f35/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1567x879+0+82/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9d%2F11%2F918e03ff455199c18490e744a55d%2F1981-120-08.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria Ruiz and Rita sit atop a car in the Mexican Independence Day Parade as it travels down East 91st Street on the Southeast Side on Sept. 15, 1957.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Southeast Chicago Historical Society&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pilsen&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Pilsen became known for its Mexican and Mexican American identity — its streets lined with colorful murals, Mexican stores and restaurants — the neighborhood was home to waves of European immigrants. Named after Plzeň in what is now the Czech Republic, Pilsen began to change in the mid-20th century as Mexican and Puerto Rican families moved in, many displaced from the Near West Side by expressway construction and the expansion of the University of Illinois Chicago campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the 1960s, Pilsen had become predominantly Latino, shaped by social activism, civic engagement and artistic expression. Today, Pilsen is 68% Latino and Hispanic, according to U.S. Census data. In recent years, rising housing costs and new development have raised concerns about gentrification and the displacement of longtime residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stories from Pilsen and the Southwest Side&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#pils-alejandra\"   &gt;Alejandra&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#sw-progresando\"   &gt;Latinos Progresando&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"lv-top\" name=\"lv-top\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a5c4ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/777bfd5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49a8def/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mexican students protest at Froebel school in 1973.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49a8def/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4529303/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/49a8def/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3024x1697+0+154/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F26%2F059d9d0045febfe48f877f2ec10b%2Fst80005939-0007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexican students protest at the Froebel Branch of Harrison High School at 2021 W. 21st St. in Chicago, May 5, 1973.

But Little Village’s white residents still moved to the suburbs, leaving room for Mexican families, many of whom were pushed west from Pilsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 1980, Latinos made up nearly half of Little Village’s population, with Mexicans as the dominant group. In 1990, the Mexican government donated the Little Village arch, cementing the neighborhood's identity. It reads “Bienvenidos a Little Village.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neighborhood was proud of its roots. Many began to call Little Village the “Mexico of the Midwest.” The latest U.S. Census data shows South Lawndale, still the area’s official name, is 81% Latino and Hispanic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pilsen and Little Village corridor now has the largest concentration of Latinos in the Midwest. Little Village’s 26th Street commercial corridor generates millions in annual revenue and is the city's second highest tax-generating district, after the Magnificent Mile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stories from Little Village/La Villita&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#lv-viento\"   &gt;Viento, the running club&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#lv-morenos\"   &gt;Moreno’s Liquors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"  data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-6e0000\" name=\"image-6e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b0e00db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/51731da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e14a6c4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Funeral and procession for Rudy Lozano\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e14a6c4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1ef1083/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e14a6c4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1347+0+51/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffd%2Fb9%2F8e36c73544eb8fbcf01ab5f5d97a%2Fbiltz-01.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1983, Rudy Lozano, a Mexican-American community activist who was instrumental in campaigning for the election of Harold Washington as mayor, was murdered in his home following Washington’s victory.

Gregory Bovino told a WBEZ reporter that some people are arrested based partly &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/09/28/ice-agents-spotted-downtown-on-michigan-avenue-along-chicago-river\"   &gt;on “how they look.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the operation, on Nov. 10, dozens of Border Patrol agents posed Downtown in front of The Bean. As they prepared to take the picture, an agent reportedly said, “Everyone say ‘Little Village!” According to media reports, the agents shouted back “Little Village!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In between, federal agents &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/05/daycare-teacher-taken-by-ice-north-side-immigration\"   &gt;disrupted daily life&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in places like Little Village, Pilsen and the Southeast Side. Immigrants and other Chicagoans feared detention while walking outside, waiting for the bus or taking children to school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some neighborhoods, the streets were empty. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/07/chicago-business-civic-leaders-ice-economy\"   &gt;Business owners saw drastic declines in sales.&lt;/a&gt; Some feared having to close. Community events and parades were canceled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neighborhoods known for their vibrancy and close-knit community life were quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families feared separation, and parents worried about the long-term impact on their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/06/judge-sara-ellis-operation-midway-blitz-tear-gas-deportation-campaign\"   &gt;Critics of the immigration operations pointed to violent tactics&lt;/a&gt;, performative operations and unconstitutional detentions. Supporters said the federal government was targeting violent and dangerous immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to U.S. Department of Justice documents, 97% of those detained during Operation Midway Blitz had no criminal records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration continued to push the narrative that it was taking murders and rapists off the streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the agents posed at The Bean, they began leaving Chicago. The federal influx of some 300 agents for Operation Midway Blitz ended. But ICE enforcement — U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — continues.

   \n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Operation Midway Blitz, the captains and runners of Viento, the Little Village run club, would message each other only to cancel a run. Now they message to check if there have been sightings of federal agents and then decide when they’ll run and their route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm usually checking in, ‘How are you all personally?’ but also, ‘What do you think about running today? What's something that we should keep an eye on?’” says Jess Vergara, 37, who was part of the group that created the club 13 years ago. “So we are prepared when things kind of pop up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The club has a new rule: No one can run by themselves. Vergara says runners will slow down or run back to make sure no one is too far behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viento means \"wind\" in Spanish. The club is mostly Latino and runs three times a week, meeting at 26th Street and South Central Park Avenue, as they have for 13 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents recognize them. Business owners wave as they pass, and members often gather after runs at restaurants for coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal immigration agents arrived in September, about a month before the Chicago Marathon. For many runners, not running wasn’t an option after weeks of training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vergara and the other captains wanted to keep the runners safe. They mapped out routes and water stops; they identified safe havens in case agents targeted them. Members provided emergency contacts in case any runners were detained. The club held Know Your Rights training for runners and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Vergara says, they are trying to keep the runners motivated, but they are also preparing, in case the feds come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are constantly checking the news, what other organizations are doing in La Villita and around Chicago,” she says. “We keep in touch with the rapid response teams and see what they're saying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's such a different feeling. It's this constant vigilance and heightened anxiety.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#lv-top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"lv-morenos\" name=\"lv-morenos\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Little Village: Moreno’s Liquors&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        &lt;bsp-carousel class=\"Carousel Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"gallery-e30023\" name=\"gallery-e30023\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slides\"&gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slide\"&gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-media\"&gt;\n        \n            \n                \n                    &lt;picture data-crop=\"large\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1204764/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x4045+0+19/resize/840x555!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2F57%2F8f254b3642c8a8e379d4c823af11%2Fblitzeffect-260215-31.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f90045d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x4045+0+19/resize/1680x1110!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2F57%2F8f254b3642c8a8e379d4c823af11%2Fblitzeffect-260215-31.jpg 2x\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9501cde/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x4045+0+19/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2F57%2F8f254b3642c8a8e379d4c823af11%2Fblitzeffect-260215-31.jpg\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mike Moreno Jr. and Mike Moreno Sr. at 3724 W. 26th St. in Little Village.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9501cde/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x4045+0+19/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2F57%2F8f254b3642c8a8e379d4c823af11%2Fblitzeffect-260215-31.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6391914/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x4045+0+19/resize/1680x1110!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2F57%2F8f254b3642c8a8e379d4c823af11%2Fblitzeffect-260215-31.jpg 2x\" width=\"840\" height=\"555\"\n        src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9501cde/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x4045+0+19/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F11%2F57%2F8f254b3642c8a8e379d4c823af11%2Fblitzeffect-260215-31.jpg\"&gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n                \n            \n        \n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-info\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-infoTitle\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-infoDescription\"&gt;Mike Moreno Jr. and Mike Moreno Sr. at Moreno’s Liquors, 3724 W. 26th St. in Little Village.

Customers have started to return, “but people have this uneasiness,” store owner Mike Moreno Jr. says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They send him messages asking if he can verify the area is clear of immigration agents before they go out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before immigration came in, if somebody saw a drone, no one thought anything of it,\" Moreno says. \"If somebody saw a helicopter flying over, they thought, 'OK, it's the news checking traffic or Chicago Police Department doing something.' Now people are scared.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreno, 34, is a third-generation entrepreneur. He grew up in Archer Heights. His grandfather immigrated to the United States in the 1960s, and his family later moved to Little Village, where they were among the first Mexican families in the neighborhood. In 1977, his father opened Moreno’s Liquors, which became one of the first Latino-owned liquor stores in Illinois. In 2019, Moreno expanded the business with Osito’s Tap, a speakeasy next door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the presence of federal agents last fall, people stayed inside, Moreno says. Sales dropped 20% at first, as much as 60% at one point, and leveled off at a 40% drop for two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says his business hasn’t fully recovered, and perhaps it won’t any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's the perfect storm. You've got inflation that's at an all-time high, you have tariffs that are exasperating that. Layoffs are happening across the board,” Moreno says. “You put all of those together, and the last thing you need is for people to be scared to even go out and shop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one should be treated like that. It’s disrespectful and inhumane,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreno says his family taught him the importance of civic engagement and advocacy. His father helped establish the Little Village Chamber of Commerce and worked with community leaders to build the neighborhood’s iconic arch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though there was fear in the fall, Moreno says, residents came together, and the moment could unite Latinos across communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To see people helping each other, bringing food to an abuelita who was afraid to go out or warning neighbors about threats, that was inspiring,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We won’t give up,” he adds. “Todo juntos. We’re in this together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#lv-top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"sc-masa\" name=\"sc-masa\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;South Chicago: Cecy’s Molino de Masa&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        &lt;bsp-carousel class=\"Carousel Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"gallery-a20008\" name=\"gallery-a20008\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slides\"&gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"Carousel-slide\"&gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-media\"&gt;\n        \n            \n                \n                    &lt;picture data-crop=\"large\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e90a353/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7302x4825+0+23/resize/840x555!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Faf%2Fbfbda29a48de8b8a9ee6bac06eba%2Fblitzeffect-260215-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/922b23a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7302x4825+0+23/resize/1680x1110!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Faf%2Fbfbda29a48de8b8a9ee6bac06eba%2Fblitzeffect-260215-08.jpg 2x\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"840\"\n     height=\"555\"\n        srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff1d075/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7302x4825+0+23/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Faf%2Fbfbda29a48de8b8a9ee6bac06eba%2Fblitzeffect-260215-08.jpg\"/&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"BLITZEFFECT_260215-08.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff1d075/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7302x4825+0+23/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Faf%2Fbfbda29a48de8b8a9ee6bac06eba%2Fblitzeffect-260215-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31272d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7302x4825+0+23/resize/1680x1110!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Faf%2Fbfbda29a48de8b8a9ee6bac06eba%2Fblitzeffect-260215-08.jpg 2x\" width=\"840\" height=\"555\"\n        src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff1d075/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7302x4825+0+23/resize/840x555!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F02%2Faf%2Fbfbda29a48de8b8a9ee6bac06eba%2Fblitzeffect-260215-08.jpg\"&gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n                \n            \n        \n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-info\"&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"CarouselSlide-infoTitle\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"CarouselSlide-infoDescription\"&gt;Cecilia Villarruel, owner of Cecy’s Molino de Masa at 8546 S.

\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1986, Cecilia “Cecy” Villarruel has been producing masa in South Chicago. She uses a molino, a machine that grinds up corn, water and other ingredients to make the dough used in Mexican favorites like tamales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of celebrating 40 years in business this year, Villarruel is worrying about her friends, family, employees and the neighborhood overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After ICE and Border Patrol began targeting South Chicago and the adjacent Southeast Side neighborhoods last fall, Villarruel noticed a change, especially around Thanksgiving and Christmas, typically a busy time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was slow. The people were afraid to stand in line,” she says in her native Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her son, Saul Villarruel, who handles the finances for the business, says sales have dramatically decreased since the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even now, “People are terrorized to go out,” Cecy Villarruel says. “I’m not afraid to go, but I’m afraid for my employees.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villarruel, a naturalized American citizen, says one worker didn't want to go out for three or four months, and some of her workers still are afraid to go outside and come to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would deliver food to their homes. A lot of them would send their grandkids, and we would also try to take the products to their home,” Villarruel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saul Villarruel says when workers don’t show up, it’s up to other family members to pick up the slack for the small staff. “It’s still a problem,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a community of African and Latino immigrants, he sees \"people looking over their shoulder,” he says. “Some people are afraid of getting stopped for just being Latino.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though he’s American-born and a citizen, Saul Villarruel worries about his own safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By looking at me, nobody ever assumes that I'm Mexican. In that sense, I'm kind of protected. But I'm not. My parents are literally immigrants. A lot of people I know are from immigrants,” he says. “These are people I've worked with, people I've grown up with, people who have taken care of me. I feel an obligation, a responsibility to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"sc-maria\" name=\"sc-maria\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;South Chicago: Maria &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-640000\" name=\"image-640000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9842379/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4508x2530+0+238/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4b%2F70%2Fd70368c749009b5b028025e6ddfa%2Fblitzeffect-260222-03.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/67b989a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4508x2530+0+238/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4b%2F70%2Fd70368c749009b5b028025e6ddfa%2Fblitzeffect-260222-03.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5761ad8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4508x2530+0+238/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4b%2F70%2Fd70368c749009b5b028025e6ddfa%2Fblitzeffect-260222-03.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Maria stands for a photo in South Chicago, Friday, Feb. 13, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5761ad8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4508x2530+0+238/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4b%2F70%2Fd70368c749009b5b028025e6ddfa%2Fblitzeffect-260222-03.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fd5b5c7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4508x2530+0+238/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4b%2F70%2Fd70368c749009b5b028025e6ddfa%2Fblitzeffect-260222-03.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5761ad8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4508x2530+0+238/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4b%2F70%2Fd70368c749009b5b028025e6ddfa%2Fblitzeffect-260222-03.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria stands for a photo in South Chicago, Friday, Feb. 13, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria, a 46-year-old mother of four, describes a feeling of panic and being trapped in her South Chicago home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She goes to her job at a business in the surrounding area, but her family limits its other activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t go to events. We stopped going to the library, doctor’s appointments. It’s changed our lives 100%,” says Maria, who asked that her last name be withheld because she fears getting deported. “At nighttime, you can’t fall asleep. You’re afraid for them to knock on the door. You don’t know what time of day they are going to come. They could break your windows.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria arrived five years ago from the Mexican border town Reynosa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was great. We had a lot of fun. Life was good,” she says in her native Spanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that’s changed. Maria says she is scared to go out for groceries and to take her children to school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My 13-year-old daughter is under a lot of stress right now, and her hair is falling out,” she says. \"It's snowed, and we haven't been able to go play in the snow. … They have even had to miss things like football practice, boxing training and other everyday activities they were used to doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maria has to talk bluntly to her children so they are prepared for what could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We plan on staying here,\" she says. \"If God allows us to stay here, we’ll stay here, unless they come for us and we’ll have to return to Mexico. We would have to start over, because our lives are here.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"

   \n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining the National Guard seemed like a good idea to a 20-year-old Southeast Side resident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she was born in the United States, her mother and siblings are undocumented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says she joined the Guard hoping to ease the path for her relatives to be naturalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to give them a better future,” she says, asking that she not be identified because she fears reprisals for talking to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threat of President Donald Trump sending the National Guard into Chicago’s streets has diminished since the fall, but it still hangs over Guard members who in some cases would have to patrol their own neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I won't feel good with that at all,” the Southeast Side woman says. “I know if I go and I have to detain people, I will be crying because I can’t control myself. It’s people that came for a better life and better opportunities and give a better future for the kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says all her friends in the guard feel conflicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of the people that I work with are Hispanic,” she says. “They are really sad about the things, and they see how this government is just messed up and everything, but like, there's nothing they really can do about anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"sc-pedraza\" name=\"sc-pedraza\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;South Chicago: Corina Pedraza&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a00000\" name=\"image-a00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2047406/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3366+0+317/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fd1%2F6f83c42547baba7ab9e2f39d00a3%2Feastsideice-101625-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a26e74a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3366+0+317/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fd1%2F6f83c42547baba7ab9e2f39d00a3%2Feastsideice-101625-09.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba058f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3366+0+317/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fd1%2F6f83c42547baba7ab9e2f39d00a3%2Feastsideice-101625-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"EASTSIDEICE-101625-09.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba058f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3366+0+317/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fd1%2F6f83c42547baba7ab9e2f39d00a3%2Feastsideice-101625-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/896441d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3366+0+317/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fd1%2F6f83c42547baba7ab9e2f39d00a3%2Feastsideice-101625-09.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba058f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5998x3366+0+317/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2Fd1%2F6f83c42547baba7ab9e2f39d00a3%2Feastsideice-101625-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corina Pedraza, member of Southwest and Southeast Rapid Response Team, speaks about federal immigration enforcement incidents in her neighborhoods during a news conference at the United Workers Center at 9805 S.

That all got shattered in October. They found the East Side,” says Pedraza, 51, a member of both the Southwest and Southeast Side Rapid Response teams, community groups that mobilize when residents report sightings of ICE or federal agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the community at large was just shocked to see the level of violence and the aggressive behavior,” she says. “There were teenagers that were slammed to the ground right at the busiest corner of the East Side, 106th and Ewing. They were going after anybody and everybody who has dark skin.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Pedraza says people here are living their lives more cautiously. ICE encounters are down, but community members fear a return in March and residents are being cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are still going onto social media and saying, ‘I saw some dark SUVs. I saw an SUV with dark tinted windows. Can someone check?’” Pedraza says. “I don't think that has gone away. I think that people are definitely keeping eyes and ears open, because we know that agents have not left the area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pedraza’s family arrived in South Chicago in the 1960s. Her father taught at several local institutions before opening a small business of his own, and her mother worked long hours at Jay’s Potato Chips. Like many families there, Pedraza says, “They helped build the neighborhood brick by brick, shift by shift.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2024, to win the presidential election, Trump gained ground with Latino voters. Many, even in the Southeast Side and South Chicago area, support him and his policies, Pedraza said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s causing a divide in the community, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s definitely people who feel like 'I'm an American citizen, I have nothing to hide. It’s not a big deal to just show them your ID,'” Pedraza says. “But there are other people who feel that it is a big deal. Why can I not walk in my neighborhood without feeling like I have to prove to someone that I am a citizen? I thought we were living in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"

\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olga Bautista speaks proudly about the Southeast Side, her only home for all her 47 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This community is families from all over the world,” she says. “Eastern European families, Mexican families, people from Latin America. Black sharecroppers from the South came up to work in the steel mills. There’s such a rich mix of cultures here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nestled along Lake Michigan, the area is known for Calumet and Steelworkers parks, where families gather, children play soccer and generations have built memories. Bautista recalls walking to the lake in minutes, attending day camp and later watching her own child train as a lifeguard there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish, where she and her children were baptized, is among the oldest Mexican-American Catholic churches in the Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the sense of safety and community has been shaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have seen a huge drop in people on the streets, shopping in the commercial corridors,” says Bautista, a member of the Chicago Board of Education. “Folks are not going to their doctor's appointments. Children are not going to school. It is definitely impacting the way that we socialize, the way that we are in community with each other. The businesses here are taking a big hit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Coast Guard facility near Calumet Park had felt approachable, with Coast Guard members interacting with families, hosting Halloween trick-or-treating and sitting at picnic tables. Security and fencing increased and it became more “militarized,” Bautista says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and other residents believe the area has been used as a staging ground for immigration enforcement operations. Those operations have had a chilling effect across the neighborhood, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm still getting notices that families have been abducted just this week. They are being kidnapped,\" Bautista says. \"They're not asking for information. They just take these folks. They pull them out of their cars, out of their houses. It's very violent. It's very traumatizing to them and to their families and this whole community — from the stories of how people are being abducted to the visual images on TV.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to top&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"sw-progresando\" name=\"sw-progresando\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Southwest Side: Latinos Progresando &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c30000\" name=\"image-c30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9ec74d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4066250/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d737ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Latinos Progresando CEO Luis Gutierrez leads a community resource meeting at Maria Saucedo Scholastic Academy in Little Village in February.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d737ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91950b6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d737ed/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcb%2F0a%2F5dfb817a45e6bd8c968258f595aa%2Fblitzeffect-260215-004.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latinos Progresando CEO Luis Gutierrez leads a community resource meeting at Maria Saucedo Scholastic Academy in Little Village in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latinos Progresando, an organization that supports immigrant communities like Pilsen and Little Village, is dealing with the fallout from Operation Midway Blitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community members want answers, says Luis Gutierrez, who founded the organization 28 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many ask for help navigating the immigration system and locating family members who have been detained. Staff members spend hours trying to determine where detainees are being held. Residents come in worried about their loved one not having their medicine or any means to communicate with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They come in every day looking for help,” says Gutierrez, 53, who spent the holiday season delivering groceries, essential household goods and gifts. He and his staff visited families who were too scared to leave their homes for fear of being detained or deported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work has taken a toll on nonprofit and advocacy workers, he says: “You’re constantly answering phone calls, emails and texts, trying to provide some sort of information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says advocates sounded the alarm early last year, asking for support, especially after they saw what happened in Los Angeles in the summer, but few outside the Latino community initially responded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Toward the end of last year, suddenly the city woke up,” Gutierrez says. “You saw people across communities standing up and saying, ‘This isn’t right.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of Mexican immigrants, Gutierrez, who grew up in Little Village, says he knows firsthand about fear and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possible detention by federal immigration officials has caused widespread anxiety and trauma, building a need for mental health services, he says. “Our community really has been in emergency response mode since COVID started, and we have not stopped.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m working with principals and we’re talking about kids walking to school by themselves,” Gutierrez says. “We’re talking about a lack of participation in programs and even in local school councils.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s sad,” he says. “But when I talk to community residents and see [them] navigating the system, talking to their kids, preparing their families, there’s so much strength and beauty in how they stand up during this time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gutierrez says residents believe immigration agents will return, but they feel more prepared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Other communities are standing up and protesting, and so we are going to continue the work, and whatever comes, we're going to deal with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"#pilsen-top\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Return to

active parent. For years, she’s enrolled her kids in after-school activities and volunteered with a parent support group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My biggest hope is that all my children grow up to be good people and become upstanding members of society,” she says. “It’s up to us as parents to lead them down the right path.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many immigrants from Mexico, Alejandra says she came to the United States 20 years ago looking for a better life and more opportunities for her future children. She and her husband wanted to raise their children in Pilsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now, after living through the fall surge of federal immigration enforcement, she is rethinking her community involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she’s tentatively allowed her children — one in high school and two in elementary school — to resume extracurricular activities like soccer and theater club that they had stopped doing in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she says that may change in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are still a little scared. I worry that people who agree with this administration behave badly or aggressively towards our community. I don’t want my kids to see any of that,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alejandra says Pilsen is usually calm and close-knit, but that the sense of safety is gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our lives have changed. You can feel it, [our community has] distrust. There are people that only see the color of our skin and identify us as enemies,” she says. “They don’t know how many years we have lived here and how we have been paying taxes and not receiving any benefits. I feel people think we are taking things from them, but that’s not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alejandra says her family knows people who have had encounters with immigration agents, including one family whose father was arrested and detained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This shouldn’t be happening,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says fear has reshaped everything. “People aren’t as chatty as they used to be. You notice people are gone, like the tamale vendor who used to be on the corner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite her fear, she remains optimistic about her children’s future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tell my

GM Ryan Poles and coach Ben Johnson could still find a Day 1 starter on either side of the line at No. 25, Jeremiah said — and don't need to swing a trade to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re in a good spot,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Ozzy Trapilo expected to need until at least midseason to recover from a patellar tendon injury and Braxton Jones about to become a free agent, the Bears are in the market for a starting left tackle, be it via trade, free agency or the draft. The Bears will continue to get a sense of the market when they attend the NFL Scouting Combine next week in Indianapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left tackles who could be available at No. 25 include Clemson’s Blake Miller, Georgia’s Monroe Freeling, Alabama’s Kadyn Proctor and Utah’s Caleb Lomu. Arizona State’s Max Iheanachor could climb up to that spot, too. The 6-5, 325 pounder moved to Los Angeles area from Nigeria in middle school and didn’t play football until junior college. Jeremiah ranked him No. 41 overall before he dominated during Senior Bowl week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s a big, physical dude whose best football is ahead of him,” Jeremiah said. “He could start getting ahead, into that range of the draft as well. Out of that clump, I can’t envision all of them would be gone, so you’re going to get one of those guys that would be able to be plug-and-play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fano and Freeling are ranked No. 19 and 21, respectively, on ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr.’s list of top 25 draftable players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At defensive end, the Bears could eye Miami’s Akheem Mesidor, who will be 25 when the season starts, or Auburn’s Keldric Faulk, who doesn’t turn 21 until September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faulk has an ideal body type and moves smoothly, Jeremiah said, but hasn’t shown the pass-rish production that teams want. Teams are “all over the map” about where he could get picked, Jeremiah said. Mesidor, who was born in Ottawa, has the ability to rush from wide but also from the inside when he moves to tackle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just not fair with him against college guards — he just kills them in there …” Jeremiah said. “This guy never stops. There’s never a breath you can take when you’re trying to block Akheem Mesidor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 6-3, Mesidor might be too short for Dennis Allen’s scheme. The same can be said for Texas A&amp;amp;M’s Cashius Howell, who is 6-2 and, Jeremiah said, has shorter-than-ideal arms. Still, he could run a blazing 40-yard dash next week. Clemson’s T.J. Parker, Oklahoma’s R. Mason Thomas and Missouri’s Zion Young could be available when the Bears pick 25th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah put Clemson defensive tackle Peter Woods on the Bears in his latest mock draft, praising his pass-rush ability. The Bears could turn to a standout safety class with their first pick, too, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re well-positioned for where they area,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only sure thing in this year’s draft appears to be the fact the Raiders will take Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza first overall. Jeremiah said he didn’t grade Mendoza as high as the Bears’ Caleb Williams, Patriots’ Drake Maye or Commanders’ Jayden Daniels when they left college two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He would slot in behind those guys,” he said. “But I think he’s excellent.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Pike House is storybook perfect: a quaint, wood and stone 19th century Tudor Revival home on the edge of a forest preserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its story had been one of neglect in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Forest Preserve District of Cook County owns the home, near 91st Street and Longwood Drive, at the southern tip of 257-acre Dan Ryan Woods. But it lacked the cash keep it in good repair — or even fix up the house when its condition slipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the 132-year-old Beverly landmark might end up happily ever after, as the first phase of stabilization and repairs on the vacant building is likely to begin this spring following a $1.5 million state grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funding was set aside in 2024 but wasn't able to be allocated until last month. That's when the Cook County Board approved a partnership agreement with the recently-created Eugene S. Pike House Foundation and the Beverly Area Arts Alliance that allows the groups to raise money for the home's rehabilitation and ultimately, use the building as the Pike House Community Cultural Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There's a lot of us out here who really care deeply about preserving any historic property that can be preserved,\" Eugene S. Pike House Foundation President Grace Kuikman said. \"But the Pike House — it's just special.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Once upon a time&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eugene S. Pike House was built in 1894 as a gardener's cottage on what were then the grounds of Pike's 32-acre estate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pike, a real estate developer who helped downtown rebuild after the Great Chicago Fire of 1872, hired architect Henry Hale Waterman to design the small home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waterman's solution was perfect for the site: a picturesque home with a deep-pitched gable roof, rusticated sandstone base, half-timbering and prominent turret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Institute of Architects Guide to Chicago said the house looks as if one could \"expect Hansel and Gretel to come tripping past.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-220000\" name=\"image-220000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/77b68b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5541x3110+0+485/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe0%2F3d%2F79f533c44987821d7012fdc2cbf8%2Fimg-0922.jpeg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4e30054/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5541x3110+0+485/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe0%2F3d%2F79f533c44987821d7012fdc2cbf8%2Fimg-0922.jpeg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f917bd2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5541x3110+0+485/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe0%2F3d%2F79f533c44987821d7012fdc2cbf8%2Fimg-0922.jpeg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"An early photo of the H.H.

Maher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Pike House, Waterman designed at least 40 other structures in the Beverly and Morgan Park communities from the 1890s to the 1920s, including what was briefly his own home at 10838 S. Longwood Drive, which was built into the glacial ridge along Longwood Drive that marks the two neighborhoods. (A non-Beverly/Morgan Park Waterman design I've always liked is &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/architecture-design/2025/06/19/endangered-washington-park-building-frank-lloyd-wright-rescue\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;South Park Terrace&lt;/a&gt; at 61st and King Drive.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ridge Historical Society Director Tim Blackburn said most of Waterman's Beverly and Morgan Park work sits on or near the ridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He just built so many houses and really used the ridge and the majestic hill [created by it] to its fullest effect,\" Blackburn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Forest Preserve District bought Pike's estate in 1921, when the agency moved to create Dan Ryan Woods. The home was used as the Forest Preserve District superintendent's office then became the Dan Ryan Woods watchman's house in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d60000\" name=\"image-d60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b44e5b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+172/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2Fbe%2F5defa6e24cbb8287e596ac8d5349%2Fpike-260209-14.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0000987/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+172/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2Fbe%2F5defa6e24cbb8287e596ac8d5349%2Fpike-260209-14.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6f6489c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+172/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2Fbe%2F5defa6e24cbb8287e596ac8d5349%2Fpike-260209-14.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Behind the Eugene S.

Legislation for the grant was sponsored by State Sen. Willie Preston (16th).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Kuikman said repair work will begin in the spring, another $1.5 million or so will be needed down the road to repair the home's interior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The interior is in pretty sad shape,\" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the work is done, the home will be an asset to the area, Beverly Area Arts Alliance President Sal Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group will have discussions with the community about the building's future use, she said. But the organization envisions the home hosting exhibitions, classes and an artist-in-residence program that could feature \"artists from all over the world to stay there and share their art,\" Campbell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We want to draw people to that place,\" she said.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "summary": "<img alt=\"Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson with his wife, Jacqueline, salutes the cheering crowd in Chicago, Wednesday, March 10, 1988. Jackson made environmental justice issues a key part of his campaign.\" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a294e3c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2997x1989+0+0/resize/840x557!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3e%2F01%2F6b1c83bd49c1b8e2b3d7255b69f8%2Fap8803100422-1.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;Peggy Shepard walked into her living room on Tuesday morning when her husband told her Jesse Jackson, the civil rights titan from South Carolina, had died. “Immediately tears started coming,” said Shepard, co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, a New York City-based nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 40 years ago, Jackson had altered the course of Shepard’s life. In the late 1980s, she was working as an editor at Time-Life Books, when a colleague mentioned an organizing meeting for Jackson’s 1988 presidential campaign in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village. “I walked into this Saturday meeting, and I walked out on air,” Shepard recalled. “Two hours later, I'm the press secretary for the Jackson campaign in Manhattan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That campaign — which would prove groundbreaking for Shepard and the country — pushed issues that had rarely been centered in national politics. Jackson made environmental justice, a term Americans were largely unfamiliar with at the time, a key plank of his second presidential run. He called for a national energy policy that would make offshore oil drilling obsolete, a plan to phase out nuclear energy, measures to reduce tailpipe pollution from cars, a conservation strategy to restore the nation's wetlands and forests, and a federally sponsored workforce in the style of the New Deal Civilian Conservation Corps. (The Biden administration launched a similar program, the American Climate Corps, in 2024, but &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://grist.org/politics/american-climate-corps-biden-jobs-program-trump/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;shuttered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it days ahead of President Trump’s return to office last year.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being in the Jesse Jackson campaign led to everything I'm doing right now,” said Shepard of the volunteer job that took her across New York City and exposed her to stark disparities between neighborhoods, especially in pollution burdens. “If I hadn't gone to that Saturday meeting, I'm not sure that I'd be sitting here today in this position.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., transformed American politics with his two historic presidential campaigns, and inspired countless organizers — including environmental justice advocates — along the way. In his later years, he began making connections between segregation in Greenville, South Carolina, where he was born, and the toxic drinking water in Flint, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Inspiring environmental justice advocacy in Chicago&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheryl Johnson, who runs the Chicago-based environmental justice nonprofit People for Community Recovery, was about 10 years old when she first saw Jackson in person. It was a grade-school field trip to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the prominent civil rights nonprofit he founded in 1971, headquartered on the South Side. The towering figure left a lifelong impression on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always remember he would say, ‘up with hope, down with dope,’” she said, recalling Jackson’s stockpile of charismatic appeals. “To see him fighting, at that particular time, for the right to be black in America, was an inspiration for me that I followed for many, many years,” Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2026/02/18/lights-camera-jesse-jackson-civil-rights-leader-pop-culture-presence\"   &gt;Lights, camera, Jackson: Civil Rights leader also became a pop culture presence&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From the television set to magazine covers, Johnson grew up with Jackson in the background. Her mother, Hazel Johnson, founded People for Community Recovery, one of the first environmental justice organizations in the country, and worked with Jackson several times during the Clinton administration. Today Hazel Johnson is remembered as “the mother of the environmental justice movement.” Cheryl Johnson never worked directly with Jackson on environmental issues in Chicago, but the two \"would have discussions on the phone,\" she said. \"He got it.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson was often pragmatic, not allowing environmental concerns to outweigh what he believed Black communities needed. In 2021, he successfully urged Illinois lawmakers to propose legislation making it easier to build a natural gas pipeline to the rural Pembroke Township south of Chicago, once referred to as the largest Black farming community in the Northern U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A secure source of energy would help kickstart other development — and in turn create jobs and generate hope,” Jackson wrote in an op-ed in support of the plan. As of this year, the pipeline is delivering &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.shawlocal.com/daily-journal/2026/01/15/economic-alliance/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;natural gas to over 100 residents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson also took an active interest in the Flint water crisis, showing up repeatedly and lending support. In early 2016, Melissa Mays filed a lawsuit against the city of Flint, Michigan, for exposing nearly 100,000 residents to unsafe water contaminated with lead, a toxic metal linked to developmental delays, cardiovascular issues, and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mays, a longtime Flint resident and a then-emerging clean water activist, remembers sitting in front of cameras and answering questions about her lawsuit when, unexpectedly, Jackson walked through the doors. “He walks right up to us to ask if he can say something,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after, Jackson declared that officials should put “tape around the city, because Flint is a crime scene.\" Mays said the moment validated her concerns and in part kicked off a longtime friendship between the two. Jackson returned to Flint repeatedly, helping turn the water crisis into national news and criticizing the Obama administration for not sufficiently responding to the crisis. He made his last public appearance in Flint in 2024 to visit the Flint Southwestern Classical Academy to highlight the importance of voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was not afraid of anybody,” Mays said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/17/what-we-know-rev-jesse-jacksons-death-services\"   &gt;What we know about Rev.

      "summary": "<img alt=\"Democratic presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson with his wife, Jacqueline, salutes the cheering crowd in Chicago, Wednesday, March 10, 1988. Jackson made environmental justice issues a key part of his campaign.\" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a294e3c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2997x1989+0+0/resize/840x557!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3e%2F01%2F6b1c83bd49c1b8e2b3d7255b69f8%2Fap8803100422-1.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;Peggy Shepard walked into her living room on Tuesday morning when her husband told her Jesse Jackson, the civil rights titan from South Carolina, had died. “Immediately tears started coming,” said Shepard, co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, a New York City-based nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 40 years ago, Jackson had altered the course of Shepard’s life. In the late 1980s, she was working as an editor at Time-Life Books, when a colleague mentioned an organizing meeting for Jackson’s 1988 presidential campaign in Manhattan’s Greenwich Village. “I walked into this Saturday meeting, and I walked out on air,” Shepard recalled. “Two hours later, I'm the press secretary for the Jackson campaign in Manhattan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That campaign — which would prove groundbreaking for Shepard and the country — pushed issues that had rarely been centered in national politics. Jackson made environmental justice, a term Americans were largely unfamiliar with at the time, a key plank of his second presidential run. He called for a national energy policy that would make offshore oil drilling obsolete, a plan to phase out nuclear energy, measures to reduce tailpipe pollution from cars, a conservation strategy to restore the nation's wetlands and forests, and a federally sponsored workforce in the style of the New Deal Civilian Conservation Corps. (The Biden administration launched a similar program, the American Climate Corps, in 2024, but &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://grist.org/politics/american-climate-corps-biden-jobs-program-trump/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;shuttered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it days ahead of President Trump’s return to office last year.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being in the Jesse Jackson campaign led to everything I'm doing right now,” said Shepard of the volunteer job that took her across New York City and exposed her to stark disparities between neighborhoods, especially in pollution burdens. “If I hadn't gone to that Saturday meeting, I'm not sure that I'd be sitting here today in this position.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., transformed American politics with his two historic presidential campaigns, and inspired countless organizers — including environmental justice advocates — along the way. In his later years, he began making connections between segregation in Greenville, South Carolina, where he was born, and the toxic drinking water in Flint, Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Inspiring environmental justice advocacy in Chicago&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheryl Johnson, who runs the Chicago-based environmental justice nonprofit People for Community Recovery, was about 10 years old when she first saw Jackson in person. It was a grade-school field trip to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, the prominent civil rights nonprofit he founded in 1971, headquartered on the South Side. The towering figure left a lifelong impression on her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I always remember he would say, ‘up with hope, down with dope,’” she said, recalling Jackson’s stockpile of charismatic appeals. “To see him fighting, at that particular time, for the right to be black in America, was an inspiration for me that I followed for many, many years,” Johnson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2026/02/18/lights-camera-jesse-jackson-civil-rights-leader-pop-culture-presence\"   &gt;Lights, camera, Jackson: Civil Rights leader also became a pop culture presence&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From the television set to magazine covers, Johnson grew up with Jackson in the background. Her mother, Hazel Johnson, founded People for Community Recovery, one of the first environmental justice organizations in the country, and worked with Jackson several times during the Clinton administration. Today Hazel Johnson is remembered as “the mother of the environmental justice movement.” Cheryl Johnson never worked directly with Jackson on environmental issues in Chicago, but the two \"would have discussions on the phone,\" she said. \"He got it.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson was often pragmatic, not allowing environmental concerns to outweigh what he believed Black communities needed. In 2021, he successfully urged Illinois lawmakers to propose legislation making it easier to build a natural gas pipeline to the rural Pembroke Township south of Chicago, once referred to as the largest Black farming community in the Northern U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A secure source of energy would help kickstart other development — and in turn create jobs and generate hope,” Jackson wrote in an op-ed in support of the plan. As of this year, the pipeline is delivering &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.shawlocal.com/daily-journal/2026/01/15/economic-alliance/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;natural gas to over 100 residents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson also took an active interest in the Flint water crisis, showing up repeatedly and lending support. In early 2016, Melissa Mays filed a lawsuit against the city of Flint, Michigan, for exposing nearly 100,000 residents to unsafe water contaminated with lead, a toxic metal linked to developmental delays, cardiovascular issues, and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mays, a longtime Flint resident and a then-emerging clean water activist, remembers sitting in front of cameras and answering questions about her lawsuit when, unexpectedly, Jackson walked through the doors. “He walks right up to us to ask if he can say something,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after, Jackson declared that officials should put “tape around the city, because Flint is a crime scene.\" Mays said the moment validated her concerns and in part kicked off a longtime friendship between the two. Jackson returned to Flint repeatedly, helping turn the water crisis into national news and criticizing the Obama administration for not sufficiently responding to the crisis. He made his last public appearance in Flint in 2024 to visit the Flint Southwestern Classical Academy to highlight the importance of voting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was not afraid of anybody,” Mays said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/17/what-we-know-rev-jesse-jacksons-death-services\"   &gt;What we know about Rev.

Woo was still adjusting to his role on the team during last season's run to the 3A title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I didn’t feel like I played at my best in the state finals, but I did help contribute to our win and the guys stepped up,\" Woo said. \"It was a collective.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woo was learning how to succeed while being the focal point of the opposition defense. He's fully mastered that now and is ready to lead the Rams through the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-4c0000\" name=\"image-4c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9ec324/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2Fb9%2Ffcc705d44525809f6c73e76e8d18%2Fob-cst-010126-8061.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/41c789c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2Fb9%2Ffcc705d44525809f6c73e76e8d18%2Fob-cst-010126-8061.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31fb6c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2Fb9%2Ffcc705d44525809f6c73e76e8d18%2Fob-cst-010126-8061.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"DePaul Prep&amp;#x27;s Rykan Woo controls the ball as the Rams play Benet at the Pontiac Holiday Tournament.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31fb6c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2Fb9%2Ffcc705d44525809f6c73e76e8d18%2Fob-cst-010126-8061.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3d3999c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2Fb9%2Ffcc705d44525809f6c73e76e8d18%2Fob-cst-010126-8061.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31fb6c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2Fb9%2Ffcc705d44525809f6c73e76e8d18%2Fob-cst-010126-8061.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePaul Prep’s Rykan Woo controls the ball as the Rams play Benet at the Pontiac Holiday Tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porter was born on the West Side and lived there before moving to Hillside in third grade.

He's developed into the best shooter in the city, posting multiple games of more than 30 points efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t say enough about his talent,” Marist coach Brian Hynes said. “And the whole school loves him.

But as a matter of text, history, and precedent, they are clearly lawful,” Kavanaugh wrote in the dissent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision doesn’t stop Trump from imposing duties under other laws. While those have more limitations on the speed and severity of Trump’s actions, top administration officials have said they expect to keep the tariff framework in place under other authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump set what he called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on most countries in April 2025 to address trade deficits that he declared a national emergency. Those came after he imposed duties on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2025/03/05/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-illinois-businesses-facing-scary-times\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Canada, China and Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, ostensibly to address a drug trafficking emergency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A series of lawsuits followed, including a case from a dozen largely Democratic-leaning states that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/04/23/dozen-states-sue-trump-administration-to-stop-tariff-policy\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;included Illinois&lt;/a&gt; and others from small businesses. The challengers argued the emergency powers law doesn’t even mention tariffs and Trump's use of it fails several legal tests, including one that doomed then-President Joe Biden's $500 billion student loan forgiveness program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court heard combined cases brought by the small businesses, including &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2025/09/11/supreme-court-president-donald-trump-tariffs-learning-resources-toys\"   &gt;Learning Resources and Hand2Mind&lt;/a&gt;, toy makers based in Vernon Hills that are owned by the same family. Learning Resources filed its lawsuit last year, as did a group of other small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As family-owned, mission-driven education companies, we brought this lawsuit to protect our 500+ employees and the schools and families who rely on us,\" Learning Resources said in a statement. The Supreme Court’s decision, declaring tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as unlawful, “is a powerful reaffirmation of the Rule of Law and Constitutional Separation of Powers that our country is built upon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We Pay the Tariffs, a national grassroots coalition of more than 800 small businesses, demanded automatic refunds to businesses that paid tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’ve taken out loans just to keep their doors open. They've frozen hiring, canceled expansion plans and watched their life savings drain away to pay tariff bills that weren't in any budget or business plan. Today, the Supreme Court has validated what we've been saying all along: these tariffs were unlawful from the start,” We Pay the Tariffs Executive Director Dan Anthony said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda Kezios, owner of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2025/11/28/shoppers-wicker-park-sales-small-business-saturday\"   &gt;Mojo Spa&lt;/a&gt; in Wicker Park and a We Pay the Tariffs member, said in a statement: “If tariffs were refunded quickly and reliably, my suppliers could lower ingredient and packaging costs. Restoring these products would immediately help close the revenue gap created during the months we were forced to discontinue more than 50% of our line due to tariff-related cost increases. That revenue is critical for sustaining the business through slower seasons and gives us a real chance to survive and stabilize.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are concerns about the lack of a refund system and that the Trump administration will find another way to impose additional duties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Small businesses are rightfully worried that the administration will respond to this legal defeat by simply reimposing the same tariff policy through other means,” Anthony said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court ruling comes despite a series of short-term wins on the court’s emergency docket that have allowed Trump to push ahead with extraordinary flexes of executive power on issues ranging from high-profile firings to major federal funding cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Republican president has been vocal about the case, calling it one of the most important in U.S. history and saying a ruling against him would be an economic body blow to the country. But legal opposition crossed the political spectrum, including libertarian and pro-business groups that are typically aligned with the GOP. Polling has found tariffs aren't broadly popular with the public, amid wider voter concern about affordability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Constitution gives Congress the power to levy tariffs. But the Trump administration argued that a 1977 law allowing the president to regulate importation during emergencies also allows him to set tariffs. Other presidents have used the law dozens of times, often to impose sanctions, but Trump was the first president to invoke it for import taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic impact of Trump's tariffs has been estimated at some $3 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Treasury has collected more than $133 billion from the import taxes the president has imposed under the emergency powers law, federal data from December shows. Many companies, including the big-box warehouse chain Costco, have already lined up in court to demand refunds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hannah Wilson, owner of The Dropped Stitch near Edgewater, said tariffs have raised costs and created stress and uncertainty for her yarn store. For example, costs have spiked for Wilson’s favorite knitting needle brand from a Michigan company that are considered the best on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of their production is done in China. Since I opened my store in November 2024, their wholesale prices have all increased by 20%-30%, due to the tariff situation,” Wilson said. “A complete set of needles that used to be $214.50 is now $271. Other brands are also increasing their prices, so simply switching to another supplier wouldn't help me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/economy/2025/10/03/chicago-ethnic-international-grocery-stores-produce-prices-tariffs-imports\"   &gt;Chicago’s ethnic grocery stores struggle to keep prices down and import goods&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/illinois-governor/2025/07/14/trump-tariffs-jb-pritzker-illinois-executive-order\"   &gt;Pritzker orders state agencies to assess potential effects of more Trump tariffs&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Funt remembers zero on-campus sports-betting chatter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minnick bottomed out on Nov. 12, 2022, during a 12-hour casino binge in which he maxed out several credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A family that once enjoyed comic Kevin Hart now despises him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s constantly in those ads,” Jennie Minnick, Rob’s mother, told Funt. “So now we hate [Hart].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s all in Funt’s new book, “Everybody Loses,” in which he shines a spotlight on the many ills of a legal industry that might have moved way too fast in blanketing the country since being given a green light in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time I see Hart, LeBron James, Wayne Gretzky, Shaquille O’Neal, Jamie Foxx, Jon Hamm and others promoting a sportsbook, I ponder their liability in leading people like Minnick astray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funt gave that cloudy issue clarity because those personalities have normalized this business, made it mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Especially for young people,” Funt said, “seeing their heroes tell them, not just that this is OK but a way to win money when that obviously is so far from the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key issues&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danny’s surname should ring a comedic bell or two. Allen, his grandfather, began a hidden microphone radio show in 1947 that transferred well to television, as ‘‘Candid Camera,’’ a year later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His son Peter, Danny’s father, continued it. In some form, ‘‘Candid Camera’’ aired on the small screen through 2014. A revival, Danny says, is in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danny, 34, explored plenty of tragedy, sorrow and duplicity in his 312-page maiden effort as an author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Georgetown, he graduated from Columbia with a master’s degree in journalism in 2015. Since 2021, he has contributed sports-betting features to the Washington Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more he dug, the more questions he compiled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two were most compelling. First, how, when and why did leagues change their tune on gambling? Not so long ago, the NFL barred Las Vegas from advertising during its precious Super Bowl broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there’s a spiffy domed stadium, not far from the Strip, that houses the Raiders and already has staged a Super Bowl. NFL-themed slot machines occupy casino floors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From saying it was such an evil to embracing it as enthusiastically as possible, I felt like we hadn’t gotten to the bottom of what exactly persuaded them to do a 180,” Funt said. “They weren’t offering answers that were satisfying.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, he says, industry leaders Draft-Kings and FanDuel are rather closed-off entities. “I wanted to take time to cultivate sources at those companies,” he said. “I wanted to learn what it’s like to work at one of those places, how the online business operates and to hear how they think of customers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will spoil nothing. Funt delivers with a deep excavation that demands attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shameful&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine states, plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, have legal sports betting. In four jurisdictions, the minimum age is only 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funt pressed a lobbyist, part of a law firm that has been influential in the national legalization movement, for details of how those moving parts work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In seeking all you wanted in Virginia, Funt asked her, what was one area that received the most pushback, the stickiest request?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She thought for a minute,” Funt said, “then finally said, ‘Uh, yeah, nothing comes to mind. We really got everything we wanted.’ When [regulators] don’t understand [sports gambling], it gives the industry so much leverage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such astounding ignorance and lack of guardrails allow a tout to charge customers for game picks and earn a percentage of their losses, via deals with affiliated companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So slimy,” Funt said. “Naive and gullible clientele being preyed on by those guys is just sad, just so wrong and shameful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those are his views, too, on the voracious Euro “ban or bankrupt” model that has so effectively crossed the pond to pollute the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funt includes a profound episode in the late NFLer Junior Seau’s life, which he called a sports horror story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We just forget about them so quickly,” Funt said. “Hopefully, people can learn from what he went through, and the fact that CTE [chronic traumatic encephalopathy] and gambling problems have some overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s pretty scary.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meager resistance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1971, cigarette ads were banned from TV. In the last 90 seconds before it began, ad wiz Jack Landry concocted a Marlboro ad featuring four cowboys riding into the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When, I ask Funt, might commercials for sports-betting companies meet a similar fate, Hamm, Foxx, Shaq (on a Clydesdale) and Hart (atop a Shetland pony) galloping away into a dusky desert?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would take something really tragic to get there,” Funt said. “A major match-fixing scandal or a clear surge in suicides due to gambling issues or an enraged gambler tries to kill an athlete because he cost him a bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any of that would be so scandalous, but the money pushing what the industry wants is so lopsided. And the resistance to that is pretty meager. I’m skeptical.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Jesse Jackson. Here's what you told us, lightly edited for clarity:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"My special memory of Jesse Jackson happened Super Tuesday — Feb. 5, 2008. I was an Obama volunteer attending the party and broadcast of Barack Obama's speech at the Hyatt. Jesse Jackson was in the bleachers behind me doing live shots with reporters. After the cameras were locked on Barack, I noticed Jesse alone and holding an Obama sign. His mind and heart were elsewhere — perhaps pondering what 'could have been' for himself or one of his children. It was the tenderest moment of a politician, activist, human that I've seen up close and personal.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;— Doreen Rice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"My husband and his friends frequented the Division Street Baths in the '70s thru the '90s. It was always a special occasion when 'The Reverend' and his entourage came into the steam room. Mr Jackson, like any good politician, would shake hands and introduce himself to everyone sitting on the tiled tiers. His charisma was contagious.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;— Sandy Doyle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I had the honor to know and do some work with him, appearing on his radio show ... and assisting his organizations where I could. I have spent most of my life defending people facing the death penalty, work which Rev. Jackson supported. My memory is not just [his] amazing work. ... It's of him sitting quietly with me at a table at the Illinois Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers dinner honoring his son, former Congressman Jackson. It's of him taking the time to speak with my then-teenage son, of his kind inquiries regarding my late husband's health, and his concern for humanity in general.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;— Andrea Lyon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"As a Northwestern University undergraduate, I marched with Jesse Jackson in the streets of Chicago for civil rights. In 1968, we were tear-gassed by Richard J. Daley's cops — illegally. I also marched with him in anti-Vietnam War marches.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;— Harvey J. Graff&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We went to a campaign rally in Iowa in 1988 and shook hands with Rev. Jackson. I will always remember how big his hands were!

Maybe you found the words within a giant heart painted inside an abandoned, run-down building you decided to explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pilsen artist known as Boots, whose real name is Kimberly Brown, has painted thousands of her original poetry snippets on sidewalks and elsewhere around Chicago since she began sharing her words with the world just before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you can find her painted poetry while walking through towns in all 50 states, part of a project that Brown says has “become bigger than me at this point.” All of them are tagged &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.instagram.com/poetrybyboots\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;@poetrybyboots&lt;/a&gt;, which is her Instagram handle. The biggest number by far are in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s always extra special when my hometown appreciates it,” says Brown, who receives tags, photos and messages nearly every day from fans who found her work. “It still blows my mind how many messages I’ll get.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While she has painted thousands of lines over the past eight years, there are some that resonate with a wider audience to which she frequently returns. Those include phrases like “Invest love in the ones who stay,” “We’re all damaged. It’s how we still love with a broken heart that matters” and “don’t give anyone the power to question who you are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown was featured on Good Morning America and other publications in 2022 while the country was in pandemic lockdown. Soon after that, she started selling shirts, bags and prints with her poetry stanzas on them in assorted fonts and graphics. Now, eight years after she began sharing her words, the Oak Lawn native said the hardest part is keeping the balance between staying true to her writing and ignoring the voice asking what might look good on the sidewalk or a hoodie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The past five years “has been a whirlwind,” she says. However, “the response has been beautiful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown began sharing her sidewalk poetry while living in Los Angeles after finishing her studies at Chicago's Columbia College. She pulled lines from the poetry that she began writing when she was 12 or 13, she says, and cut her own stencils with her words. She ventured into abandoned buildings and painted them on the walls, encased in big hearts. She moved back to Chicago in 2020, and continued her work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While fans would hold scavenger hunts to find her writing, Brown realized she wanted to share it with more than just those who enjoy exploring abandoned buildings. So she turned to the streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Brown meticulously researches each city she visits, figuring out the best places to add her word art. She might use different color paint in different towns, or different phrases in different neighborhoods. When she visits a new city she might add hundreds of poetry verses before she leaves, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She usually spray paints overnight and doesn’t plan to stop anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I live and breathe it,” she says. “It’s amazing how little sleep I can live on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-d00000\" name=\"module-d00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Murals and Mosaics Newsletter&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-990000\" name=\"html-embed-module-990000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"piano-sidebar-newsletter-murals-and-mosaics\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-b20000\" name=\"module-b20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Chicago’s murals and mosaics sidebar&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/murals-mosaics\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Chicago’s murals &amp;amp; mosaics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;Part of a series on public art in the city and suburbs. &lt;b&gt;Know of a mural or mosaic?
