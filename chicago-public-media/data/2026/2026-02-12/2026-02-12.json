He shot 8-for-15 and threw down a vicious tip dunk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuqua Valley is a consistently strong program and has posted big win totals and long win streaks in previous seasons. The &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/super-25-basketball-rankings/2026/02/08/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;No. 6 Wildcats&lt;/a&gt; are 27-1 this season and have won 25 consecutive games. In past years, that didn’t regularly lead to deep playoff runs. Neuqua Valley has played in two supersectionals (2008, 2009) but never advanced to state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The energy is definitely higher than last year,” Kelly said. “But it would help us get over that hump to become a great team if there was more energy, for sure. There needs to be something to get the town as a whole into it, not just Neuqua. This is a good year for us to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd Sutton is the only coach in school history. Neuqua Valley opened in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Friday nights are packed here, but [Naperville] is very divided,” Sutton said. “We are at the south end of town and we really don’t count. We are on a little island down here. But we take care of our own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly is a top 40 player in the national sophomore class and has college offers from Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and Drake. He’s averaging 20 points, eight rebounds and four assists and shooting 52%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly is turning in one of the most impressive sophomore seasons the area has seen in many years. Warren’s Jaxson Davis won Mr. Basketball last season after an impressive run to the state championship game as a sophomore. Bolingbrook’s Davion Thompson won the Sun-Times Player of the Year as a sophomore last season. But neither player was as good as Kelly has been this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You wouldn’t believe what we see in practice,” Sutton said. “It is [Kelly’s] passing. Wait until he gets stars around him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuqua Valley is in the Class 4A Bolingbrook sectional which features top-ranked Benet, No. 8 Bolingbrook and a slew of dangerous unranked teams including Naperville North, Downers Grove North, Oswego East, Oswego and Plainfield East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-bd0000\" name=\"image-bd0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d45dcd3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F93%2Fe5%2F71cd315348ca99ddc1497d4199b8%2Fob-cst-021226-7005.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/098f817/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F93%2Fe5%2F71cd315348ca99ddc1497d4199b8%2Fob-cst-021226-7005.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8af1092/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F93%2Fe5%2F71cd315348ca99ddc1497d4199b8%2Fob-cst-021226-7005.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Neuqua Valley&amp;#x27;s (L-R) Mason Martin, Carter Coviello, Cole Kelly, and Luke Balgro after the Wildcats defeat Yorkville Christian 74-43.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8af1092/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F93%2Fe5%2F71cd315348ca99ddc1497d4199b8%2Fob-cst-021226-7005.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/03ec14f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F93%2Fe5%2F71cd315348ca99ddc1497d4199b8%2Fob-cst-021226-7005.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8af1092/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F93%2Fe5%2F71cd315348ca99ddc1497d4199b8%2Fob-cst-021226-7005.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuqua Valley’s (L-R) Mason Martin, Carter Coviello, Cole Kelly, and Luke Balgro after the Wildcats defeat Yorkville Christian 74-43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can definitely make it far this year,” Wildcats junior Luke Balgro said. “Our chemistry has really improved. We are practicing really hard and moving the ball well and getting everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly isn’t alone. Junior Mason Martin also averages 20 points a game and committed to Illinois this season. Martin had nine points and eight rebounds against Yorkville Christian (16-10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balgro, point guard Carter Coviello and guard Arshil Khimani have improved steadily throughout the 25-game win streak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought we would be above average this year,” Sutton said. “People always tell me I’m sandbagging. But [Coviello] has had a good year. Balgro came out of nowhere and had a tremendous year. Guys we didn’t expect have really played well and the bench has been fantastic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naperville is a football city and not a basketball hot bed, but Kelly is the best high school basketball player the city has seen since Candace Parker graduated from Naperville Central in 2004. Maybe it will take a run to state for the excitement to truly ramp up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been a good year for me and the team,” Kelly said. “We have to take care of business against DeKalb and Naperville North to win the conference. I am hunting for a state championship. But the sectional is stacked and making it out of there is going to be super tough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-b40000\" name=\"html-embed-module-b40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"No Shot Clock, Ep. 201: Conference quick takes\" allowtransparency=\"true\" height=\"150\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);height:150px;\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=5patj-1a40c88-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=auto&amp;logo_link=episode_page&amp;btn-skin=c73a3a\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Anfernee Simons was returning to Boston since his trade to the Bulls and Nikola Vucevic was facing the team he played with for five-plus years before putting on Celtic green in that same deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it was on purpose or more likely accidental, both players articulately laid out the stark differences between the two organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just the opportunity to go out there and contribute to winning, and I’ve said before a historic franchise,” Simons said, when asked what he took away most from his time with the Celtics. “They have a lot of aspirations to win a championship, and you see that each and every day by the habits, by the way they speak to each other, it’s a one-common goal. So I learned a lot just being around and being able to experience that on the court, which I’m very grateful for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours later Vucevic was told of Simons’ comments and asked if he felt a difference between being a Bull and a Celtic, even as fresh as it was. He agreed with Simons’ take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obviously because of the history and they’ve won recently,” Vucevic said of the single-mindedness of chasing a title. “They have players that have been a part of it. But I think also because of how well they’ve been playing lately. They really feel like they have another chance at it. So you can really feel it. It just comes with the culture of having done it so much and having done it recently, having the players, coaching staff and the front office, everything. They’re really focused on winning now and going deep in the postseason, and you can really tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just the situation they’re in, it was different in Chicago because they were a younger team, trying to figure out the next move and the pieces, things like that. Here, you definitely feel that. It’s a good opportunity for me and I hope I can make the best out of it, help this team achieve its goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vucevic continued taking steps in that direction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing in his third game since the Bulls traded him, Vucevic reminded his former team why he was a walking double-double, scoring 19 points, grabbing 11 boards, handing out three assists and blocking two shots, all while finishing a plus-26 in the plus/minus category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Simons watched the Bulls (24-31) drop a fourth consecutive game since the trade deadline – sixth overall straight loss – as he scored seven against the Celtics, watching them still sit in the No. 2 seed of the Eastern Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk about the penthouse to the outhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for Bulls coach Billy Donovan his mission statement remains the same: Try and get this ship pointed in the right direction as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the defensive side we have got to get way more physical,” Donovan reiterated after the latest loss. “That’s first and foremost, even before the coverages and things like that. We’re getting hit on screens and held up, so way more physical. So I think it starts there first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The other thing too is we’ve got to be able to sit down and guard one-on-one a little bit. I thought there were drives that went right through us, knocked us out of the way and took layups. I think you’ve got to be way more physical. Whatever the schemes are, if you don’t (play physical) it’s going to be really hard.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

I think they’re just trying to get them to a certain stage where they spend more and more time on the court, and they get past where it’s tight. There have been previous days where it has been tight where, I don’t want to say they back up, but they hold them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do think they are moving in the right direction and they’re not far away. Hopefully the break helps the healing process and hopefully we get them back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because there are still major decisions to be made and a short runway to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls are keeping the likes of restricted free agent Jaden Ivey and Rob Dillingham (rookie contract) but still want to have conclusions on the futures of unrestricted free agents Collin Sexton and Anfernee Simons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means getting a complete view of what that looks like working with Giddey and Jones.&lt;br&gt;First things first, Donovan still wants to do what he can to get the new guards in better condition to also see how they fit the up-tempo pace the Bulls play at offensively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why a lot of guys will be taking some homework home with them for the break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things we’ve tried to do coming into this break and then coming back, for all these guys, is give them some kind of program and something they can do in terms of their conditioning and what they need to do the next week,” Donovan said. “I get it, it’s the All-Star Break, but the situation these guys are going to be in we need them working to get into better shape with how we’re trying to play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikola Vucevic met with the Bulls media before the game against his former teammates and was asked how he most wanted to be remembered in his five years with the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Good professional, good teammate, good guy, that would be the main three things,” Vucevic said. “I wish we had more team success. It wasn’t meant to be for different reasons, but I think I established some great relationships that will last a lot longer than I play basketball. I hope the fans remember someone that went out every night and was a true pro, did the best I could.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next man down&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frontcourt continued to be paper thin as the team headed into the break, as Isaac Okoro was out because of a sore knee. According to Donovan, Okoro banged his knee in the Denver loss, and it was acting up against Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team opted to shut him down and get him ready for the final push. Patrick Williams started in Okoro’s place.&lt;/p&gt;",

Aspira CEO Edgar Lopez says he will no longer be able to make payroll starting in mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to interim CEO/Supt. Macquline King, 13 of the 21 board members didn’t seem keen on Aspira’s request for a lifeline. They called it “unprecedented” and said it would violate a state law that limits the amount school districts can provide charters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board members urged the district to prepare for the “reality” of the charter operator’s potential insolvency and come up with a plan to allow the community to stay together as they leave for other nearby schools, as well as minimize disruptions to students’ educations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS officials did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charter network runs two high schools — Aspira Business and Finance High School and Aspira Early College High School — both in Avondale on the Northwest Side. Together, they have about 570 students. Aspira also runs a third school, an alternative school that re-enrolls dropouts, through Youth Connection Charter School. It is unclear how these students might be impacted by a potential closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If Aspira closes, we are not the ones closing Aspira, Aspira’s actions and Aspira's plans and Aspira's decisions are what is closing that school,” said Debby Pope, a board member representing a North Side district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Board member Norma Rios-Sierra, whose district includes both Aspira high school campuses, acknowledged the dire situation for the charter network and said she’s spoken with principals at other nearby schools about supporting Aspira students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“&lt;/b&gt;We have come to a space where the very real reality is we are going to possibly see a mid-year closure,” Norma-Rios Sierra said at a Chicago Board of Education meeting Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One parent told the Sun-Times that she is preparing to transfer her freshman out of Aspira Early College. “I’m done with it,” said Edith Villasenor, noting that the turmoil has dampened her son's excitement about school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lopez said he doesn’t “see” CPS allowing schools to close down mid-year, though he admitted, “I don’t control it. I can’t say for sure what’s going to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lopez warned CPS in November that the charter network couldn’t make it to the end of the year without $5 million in additional revenue. District officials rejected that request, instead giving Aspira a $750,000 cash advance and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/11/19/chicago-public-schools-aspira-charter-network-finances-cps-investigation\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;sending a letter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; accusing the network of a “failure of governance” and a “lack of financial proficiency necessary\" to run a school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lopez said his network is suffering from CPS’ chronic underfunding of charter schools and declining enrollment. In an interview Tuesday, he pointed out that CPS has a lot of underenrolled schools that get more money per student than those with healthy enrollment. Lopez said he is putting together a list to prove this to CPS officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Board members, though, seem to be growing weary of having to bail out charter schools, several of which are struggling with declining enrollment and rising costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the school board voted to take over five charter schools and let two close. And in November the CPS board voted to turn the privately run, publicly funded Chicago High School for the Arts into a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/11/04/cps-chiarts-epic-academy\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;district-run magnet school&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after its operator didn’t renew its contract with the district due to financial deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many members of the board are generally against school closings, citing the harm caused to students, but they are allowing a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2025/09/16/south-chicago-charter-school-may-abruptly-close-stranding-250-students\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;small charter school in South Chicago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to close in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter signed by the 13 board members demanded the district improve its oversight and renewal system for charter school contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/11/25/cps-to-help-aspira-make-payroll-but-charter-operators-financial-woes-remain\"   &gt;CPS to help Aspira make payroll, but charter operator’s financial woes remain&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Gregory Bovino praised him after the shooting. The support continued up the chain, he said, from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem up to someone known as “El Jefe himself” — who might even be President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Martinez and her attorneys say &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/10/marimar-martinez-the-chicago-woman-shot-by-border-patrol-agent-expected-to-file-lawsuit-release-evidence\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;newly released evidence&lt;/a&gt; shows Border Patrol agent Charles Exum lied to justify her shooting. And Wednesday, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said Exum “was placed on administrative leave.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesperson, who made the comment in an email to the Chicago Sun-Times, did not respond to a follow-up email asking when the leave began, or if it’s still in effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While incremental, it’s a notable development that comes after a weekslong campaign by Martinez, who was shot five times by Exum on Oct. 4 on the Southwest Side. Martinez decided to speak out last month after immigration officers in Minneapolis&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;fatally shot Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-580000\" name=\"image-580000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2d2faf0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1012x568+88+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2F08%2Fa0028a8f4e6e9b98ab87fb4c5310%2Fexum2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6faed92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1012x568+88+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2F08%2Fa0028a8f4e6e9b98ab87fb4c5310%2Fexum2.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fabd1b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1012x568+88+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2F08%2Fa0028a8f4e6e9b98ab87fb4c5310%2Fexum2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Bovino email to Exum\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fabd1b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1012x568+88+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2F08%2Fa0028a8f4e6e9b98ab87fb4c5310%2Fexum2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4251d08/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1012x568+88+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2F08%2Fa0028a8f4e6e9b98ab87fb4c5310%2Fexum2.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fabd1b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1012x568+88+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2F08%2Fa0028a8f4e6e9b98ab87fb4c5310%2Fexum2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An email from U.s.

But it’s unclear where that investigation stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and other members of Martinez’s legal team said they plan to pursue a Federal Tort Claim Act complaint against Homeland Security and Exum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a time where you just cannot trust the words of our federal officials,” Parente said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/10/marimar-martinez-the-chicago-woman-shot-by-border-patrol-agent-expected-to-file-lawsuit-release-evidence\"   &gt;Border Patrol agents say ‘time to get aggressive’ in footage that contradicts claims against Marimar Martinez&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Evidence in Martinez’s case was released Tuesday by Chicago U.S. Attorney Andrew Boutros’ office. It released the records even though it had previously objected to the disclosure of certain evidence, including text messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Georgia Alexakis on Friday &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/02/06/federal-judge-will-let-marimar-martinez-release-text-messages-sent-by-border-patrol-agent-who-shot-her\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;gave Martinez permission&lt;/a&gt; to release the evidence, anyway. By releasing it Tuesday, prosecutors preempted Martinez’s news conference Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parente said they released it “at the eleventh hour in a misguided attempt to take the sting out of just how damaging it is for the government.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez followed the Tahoe driven by Exum on Oct. 4. She honked her horn, yelled “la migra” and tried to warn people about the agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she pulled her Rogue beside the Tahoe near 39th and Kedzie, where she said Exum swerved toward her Rogue and their vehicles swiped each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXGuQ7FrC38?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Border Patrol footage contradicts claims against Marimar Martinez\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In body-worn camera footage from the incident, agents riding in the Tahoe are heard saying “it’s time to get aggressive” and “we’re going to make contact, we’re boxed in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exum appears to turn his steering wheel to the left,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;toward Martinez’s car, as his Tahoe collided with the Rogue. Exum told the FBI he “veered his vehicle to the left” after the collision “in an attempt to create space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that undermines the initial claim by Homeland Security that Martinez “rammed” Exum’s Tahoe with her Rogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the collision, an agent can be heard saying “we’ve been struck, we’ve been struck.” Exum also gets out of the vehicle, and five gunshots are heard off-camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez said she stopped her Rogue but feared being “manhandled” by the agents, so she drove away. She said she drove to her “farthest left” to avoid the agents climbing out of their vehicle on her right. But as she passed, she said Exum opened fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-110000\" name=\"image-110000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/612eb0b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0850f39/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a80d80/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Charles Exum text message\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a80d80/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e5c3f8a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a80d80/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text messages by Border Patrol agent Charles Exum after the Oct. 4 shooting of Marimar Martinez in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney’s office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exum wrote in a text message that his superiors had been supportive after the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has been including Chief Bovino, Chief Banks, Sec Noem and El Jefe himself … according to Bovino,” Exum wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agent even shared a text from someone in Vermont.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;It said,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“good job brother, glad you are unharmed and get to live to tell the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You are a legend among agents you better f---in know that.

You're a natural leader with concerns for social justice. You're objective and progressive. You appreciate the finer things in life. This is a year of service, perhaps service to family. Take care of yourself so you can be a resource to those who turn to you for guidance, comfort and encouragement. &lt;/p&gt;",

Now [Liam] can get back to wrestling.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly, an Illinois recruit, won the Class 3A 157-pound title last season and has competed at 165 pounds this season. He has had a non-contagious skin condition — granuloma annulare — on his upper arms since his freshman year. A doctor had filled out the IHSA's Required Medical Form, which has allowed him to compete uninterrupted until Morton officials blocked him from wrestling in the regional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five days later, Kelly was allowed to wrestle for the Caravan at the Marmion Dual-Team Sectional and pinned his opponent at 190 pounds in 16 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Caravan were eliminated from team competition with a 46-23 loss to Marmion, but now Kelly is back in the individual bracket. He won't be taking anyone's spot in the 165-pound bracket in Hinsdale Central, but will be added as a 13th competitor in what is usually a 12-wrestler bracket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top four finishers at each weight in the sectionals advance to the state finals at State Farm Center in Champaign on Feb. 19-21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her ruling, Conlon noted the IHSA did not explain why Morton officials wouldn't let Kelly compete, while other schools did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conlon also wrote \"there is no health or safety risk\" that would arise from him competing \"as evidenced by the Required Medical Forms and the record.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney Steve Glink, who represented Michael Kelly, told the Sun-Times: \"I wish the IHSA had voluntarily corrected it, but I'm glad the judge did the right thing.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mount Carmel athletic director Phil Segroves also applauded the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We're grateful,\" he told the Sun-Times. \"We feel this is going to end the right way. Liam should be wrestling. He's handled this ... with the utmost class.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IHSA official did not respond to a message seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;",
