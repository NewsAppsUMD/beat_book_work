He shot 8-for-15 and threw down a vicious tip dunk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuqua Valley is a consistently strong program and has posted big win totals and long win streaks in previous seasons. The &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/super-25-basketball-rankings/2026/02/08/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;No. 6 Wildcats&lt;/a&gt; are 27-1 this season and have won 25 consecutive games. In past years, that didn’t regularly lead to deep playoff runs. Neuqua Valley has played in two supersectionals (2008, 2009) but never advanced to state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The energy is definitely higher than last year,” Kelly said. “But it would help us get over that hump to become a great team if there was more energy, for sure. There needs to be something to get the town as a whole into it, not just Neuqua. This is a good year for us to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd Sutton is the only coach in school history. Neuqua Valley opened in 1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Friday nights are packed here, but [Naperville] is very divided,” Sutton said. “We are at the south end of town and we really don’t count. We are on a little island down here. But we take care of our own.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly is a top 40 player in the national sophomore class and has college offers from Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and Drake. He’s averaging 20 points, eight rebounds and four assists and shooting 52%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly is turning in one of the most impressive sophomore seasons the area has seen in many years. Warren’s Jaxson Davis won Mr. Basketball last season after an impressive run to the state championship game as a sophomore. Bolingbrook’s Davion Thompson won the Sun-Times Player of the Year as a sophomore last season. But neither player was as good as Kelly has been this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You wouldn’t believe what we see in practice,” Sutton said. “It is [Kelly’s] passing. Wait until he gets stars around him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuqua Valley is in the Class 4A Bolingbrook sectional which features top-ranked Benet, No. 8 Bolingbrook and a slew of dangerous unranked teams including Naperville North, Downers Grove North, Oswego East, Oswego and Plainfield East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-bd0000\" name=\"image-bd0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d45dcd3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F93%2Fe5%2F71cd315348ca99ddc1497d4199b8%2Fob-cst-021226-7005.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/098f817/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F93%2Fe5%2F71cd315348ca99ddc1497d4199b8%2Fob-cst-021226-7005.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8af1092/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F93%2Fe5%2F71cd315348ca99ddc1497d4199b8%2Fob-cst-021226-7005.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Neuqua Valley&amp;#x27;s (L-R) Mason Martin, Carter Coviello, Cole Kelly, and Luke Balgro after the Wildcats defeat Yorkville Christian 74-43.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8af1092/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F93%2Fe5%2F71cd315348ca99ddc1497d4199b8%2Fob-cst-021226-7005.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/03ec14f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F93%2Fe5%2F71cd315348ca99ddc1497d4199b8%2Fob-cst-021226-7005.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8af1092/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F93%2Fe5%2F71cd315348ca99ddc1497d4199b8%2Fob-cst-021226-7005.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuqua Valley’s (L-R) Mason Martin, Carter Coviello, Cole Kelly, and Luke Balgro after the Wildcats defeat Yorkville Christian 74-43.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can definitely make it far this year,” Wildcats junior Luke Balgro said. “Our chemistry has really improved. We are practicing really hard and moving the ball well and getting everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly isn’t alone. Junior Mason Martin also averages 20 points a game and committed to Illinois this season. Martin had nine points and eight rebounds against Yorkville Christian (16-10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balgro, point guard Carter Coviello and guard Arshil Khimani have improved steadily throughout the 25-game win streak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought we would be above average this year,” Sutton said. “People always tell me I’m sandbagging. But [Coviello] has had a good year. Balgro came out of nowhere and had a tremendous year. Guys we didn’t expect have really played well and the bench has been fantastic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naperville is a football city and not a basketball hot bed, but Kelly is the best high school basketball player the city has seen since Candace Parker graduated from Naperville Central in 2004. Maybe it will take a run to state for the excitement to truly ramp up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been a good year for me and the team,” Kelly said. “We have to take care of business against DeKalb and Naperville North to win the conference. I am hunting for a state championship. But the sectional is stacked and making it out of there is going to be super tough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-b40000\" name=\"html-embed-module-b40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"No Shot Clock, Ep. 201: Conference quick takes\" allowtransparency=\"true\" height=\"150\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);height:150px;\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=5patj-1a40c88-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=auto&amp;logo_link=episode_page&amp;btn-skin=c73a3a\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Anfernee Simons was returning to Boston since his trade to the Bulls and Nikola Vucevic was facing the team he played with for five-plus years before putting on Celtic green in that same deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it was on purpose or more likely accidental, both players articulately laid out the stark differences between the two organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just the opportunity to go out there and contribute to winning, and I’ve said before a historic franchise,” Simons said, when asked what he took away most from his time with the Celtics. “They have a lot of aspirations to win a championship, and you see that each and every day by the habits, by the way they speak to each other, it’s a one-common goal. So I learned a lot just being around and being able to experience that on the court, which I’m very grateful for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours later Vucevic was told of Simons’ comments and asked if he felt a difference between being a Bull and a Celtic, even as fresh as it was. He agreed with Simons’ take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obviously because of the history and they’ve won recently,” Vucevic said of the single-mindedness of chasing a title. “They have players that have been a part of it. But I think also because of how well they’ve been playing lately. They really feel like they have another chance at it. So you can really feel it. It just comes with the culture of having done it so much and having done it recently, having the players, coaching staff and the front office, everything. They’re really focused on winning now and going deep in the postseason, and you can really tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just the situation they’re in, it was different in Chicago because they were a younger team, trying to figure out the next move and the pieces, things like that. Here, you definitely feel that. It’s a good opportunity for me and I hope I can make the best out of it, help this team achieve its goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vucevic continued taking steps in that direction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing in his third game since the Bulls traded him, Vucevic reminded his former team why he was a walking double-double, scoring 19 points, grabbing 11 boards, handing out three assists and blocking two shots, all while finishing a plus-26 in the plus/minus category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Simons watched the Bulls (24-31) drop a fourth consecutive game since the trade deadline – sixth overall straight loss – as he scored seven against the Celtics, watching them still sit in the No. 2 seed of the Eastern Conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk about the penthouse to the outhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And for Bulls coach Billy Donovan his mission statement remains the same: Try and get this ship pointed in the right direction as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On the defensive side we have got to get way more physical,” Donovan reiterated after the latest loss. “That’s first and foremost, even before the coverages and things like that. We’re getting hit on screens and held up, so way more physical. So I think it starts there first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The other thing too is we’ve got to be able to sit down and guard one-on-one a little bit. I thought there were drives that went right through us, knocked us out of the way and took layups. I think you’ve got to be way more physical. Whatever the schemes are, if you don’t (play physical) it’s going to be really hard.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

I think they’re just trying to get them to a certain stage where they spend more and more time on the court, and they get past where it’s tight. There have been previous days where it has been tight where, I don’t want to say they back up, but they hold them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do think they are moving in the right direction and they’re not far away. Hopefully the break helps the healing process and hopefully we get them back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because there are still major decisions to be made and a short runway to reach them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls are keeping the likes of restricted free agent Jaden Ivey and Rob Dillingham (rookie contract) but still want to have conclusions on the futures of unrestricted free agents Collin Sexton and Anfernee Simons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means getting a complete view of what that looks like working with Giddey and Jones.&lt;br&gt;First things first, Donovan still wants to do what he can to get the new guards in better condition to also see how they fit the up-tempo pace the Bulls play at offensively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why a lot of guys will be taking some homework home with them for the break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things we’ve tried to do coming into this break and then coming back, for all these guys, is give them some kind of program and something they can do in terms of their conditioning and what they need to do the next week,” Donovan said. “I get it, it’s the All-Star Break, but the situation these guys are going to be in we need them working to get into better shape with how we’re trying to play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nikola Vucevic met with the Bulls media before the game against his former teammates and was asked how he most wanted to be remembered in his five years with the franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Good professional, good teammate, good guy, that would be the main three things,” Vucevic said. “I wish we had more team success. It wasn’t meant to be for different reasons, but I think I established some great relationships that will last a lot longer than I play basketball. I hope the fans remember someone that went out every night and was a true pro, did the best I could.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next man down&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The frontcourt continued to be paper thin as the team headed into the break, as Isaac Okoro was out because of a sore knee. According to Donovan, Okoro banged his knee in the Denver loss, and it was acting up against Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team opted to shut him down and get him ready for the final push. Patrick Williams started in Okoro’s place.&lt;/p&gt;",

Aspira CEO Edgar Lopez says he will no longer be able to make payroll starting in mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to interim CEO/Supt. Macquline King, 13 of the 21 board members didn’t seem keen on Aspira’s request for a lifeline. They called it “unprecedented” and said it would violate a state law that limits the amount school districts can provide charters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board members urged the district to prepare for the “reality” of the charter operator’s potential insolvency and come up with a plan to allow the community to stay together as they leave for other nearby schools, as well as minimize disruptions to students’ educations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS officials did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charter network runs two high schools — Aspira Business and Finance High School and Aspira Early College High School — both in Avondale on the Northwest Side. Together, they have about 570 students. Aspira also runs a third school, an alternative school that re-enrolls dropouts, through Youth Connection Charter School. It is unclear how these students might be impacted by a potential closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If Aspira closes, we are not the ones closing Aspira, Aspira’s actions and Aspira's plans and Aspira's decisions are what is closing that school,” said Debby Pope, a board member representing a North Side district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Board member Norma Rios-Sierra, whose district includes both Aspira high school campuses, acknowledged the dire situation for the charter network and said she’s spoken with principals at other nearby schools about supporting Aspira students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“&lt;/b&gt;We have come to a space where the very real reality is we are going to possibly see a mid-year closure,” Norma-Rios Sierra said at a Chicago Board of Education meeting Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One parent told the Sun-Times that she is preparing to transfer her freshman out of Aspira Early College. “I’m done with it,” said Edith Villasenor, noting that the turmoil has dampened her son's excitement about school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lopez said he doesn’t “see” CPS allowing schools to close down mid-year, though he admitted, “I don’t control it. I can’t say for sure what’s going to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lopez warned CPS in November that the charter network couldn’t make it to the end of the year without $5 million in additional revenue. District officials rejected that request, instead giving Aspira a $750,000 cash advance and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/11/19/chicago-public-schools-aspira-charter-network-finances-cps-investigation\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;sending a letter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; accusing the network of a “failure of governance” and a “lack of financial proficiency necessary\" to run a school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lopez said his network is suffering from CPS’ chronic underfunding of charter schools and declining enrollment. In an interview Tuesday, he pointed out that CPS has a lot of underenrolled schools that get more money per student than those with healthy enrollment. Lopez said he is putting together a list to prove this to CPS officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Board members, though, seem to be growing weary of having to bail out charter schools, several of which are struggling with declining enrollment and rising costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the school board voted to take over five charter schools and let two close. And in November the CPS board voted to turn the privately run, publicly funded Chicago High School for the Arts into a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/11/04/cps-chiarts-epic-academy\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;district-run magnet school&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after its operator didn’t renew its contract with the district due to financial deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many members of the board are generally against school closings, citing the harm caused to students, but they are allowing a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2025/09/16/south-chicago-charter-school-may-abruptly-close-stranding-250-students\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;small charter school in South Chicago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to close in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter signed by the 13 board members demanded the district improve its oversight and renewal system for charter school contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/11/25/cps-to-help-aspira-make-payroll-but-charter-operators-financial-woes-remain\"   &gt;CPS to help Aspira make payroll, but charter operator’s financial woes remain&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Gregory Bovino praised him after the shooting. The support continued up the chain, he said, from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem up to someone known as “El Jefe himself” — who might even be President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Martinez and her attorneys say &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/10/marimar-martinez-the-chicago-woman-shot-by-border-patrol-agent-expected-to-file-lawsuit-release-evidence\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;newly released evidence&lt;/a&gt; shows Border Patrol agent Charles Exum lied to justify her shooting. And Wednesday, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said Exum “was placed on administrative leave.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokesperson, who made the comment in an email to the Chicago Sun-Times, did not respond to a follow-up email asking when the leave began, or if it’s still in effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While incremental, it’s a notable development that comes after a weekslong campaign by Martinez, who was shot five times by Exum on Oct. 4 on the Southwest Side. Martinez decided to speak out last month after immigration officers in Minneapolis&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;fatally shot Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-580000\" name=\"image-580000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2d2faf0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1012x568+88+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2F08%2Fa0028a8f4e6e9b98ab87fb4c5310%2Fexum2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6faed92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1012x568+88+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2F08%2Fa0028a8f4e6e9b98ab87fb4c5310%2Fexum2.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fabd1b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1012x568+88+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2F08%2Fa0028a8f4e6e9b98ab87fb4c5310%2Fexum2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Bovino email to Exum\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fabd1b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1012x568+88+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2F08%2Fa0028a8f4e6e9b98ab87fb4c5310%2Fexum2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4251d08/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1012x568+88+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2F08%2Fa0028a8f4e6e9b98ab87fb4c5310%2Fexum2.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fabd1b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1012x568+88+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2F08%2Fa0028a8f4e6e9b98ab87fb4c5310%2Fexum2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An email from U.s.

But it’s unclear where that investigation stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and other members of Martinez’s legal team said they plan to pursue a Federal Tort Claim Act complaint against Homeland Security and Exum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a time where you just cannot trust the words of our federal officials,” Parente said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/10/marimar-martinez-the-chicago-woman-shot-by-border-patrol-agent-expected-to-file-lawsuit-release-evidence\"   &gt;Border Patrol agents say ‘time to get aggressive’ in footage that contradicts claims against Marimar Martinez&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Evidence in Martinez’s case was released Tuesday by Chicago U.S. Attorney Andrew Boutros’ office. It released the records even though it had previously objected to the disclosure of certain evidence, including text messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Georgia Alexakis on Friday &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/02/06/federal-judge-will-let-marimar-martinez-release-text-messages-sent-by-border-patrol-agent-who-shot-her\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;gave Martinez permission&lt;/a&gt; to release the evidence, anyway. By releasing it Tuesday, prosecutors preempted Martinez’s news conference Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parente said they released it “at the eleventh hour in a misguided attempt to take the sting out of just how damaging it is for the government.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez followed the Tahoe driven by Exum on Oct. 4. She honked her horn, yelled “la migra” and tried to warn people about the agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said she pulled her Rogue beside the Tahoe near 39th and Kedzie, where she said Exum swerved toward her Rogue and their vehicles swiped each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXGuQ7FrC38?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Border Patrol footage contradicts claims against Marimar Martinez\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In body-worn camera footage from the incident, agents riding in the Tahoe are heard saying “it’s time to get aggressive” and “we’re going to make contact, we’re boxed in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exum appears to turn his steering wheel to the left,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;toward Martinez’s car, as his Tahoe collided with the Rogue. Exum told the FBI he “veered his vehicle to the left” after the collision “in an attempt to create space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, that undermines the initial claim by Homeland Security that Martinez “rammed” Exum’s Tahoe with her Rogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the collision, an agent can be heard saying “we’ve been struck, we’ve been struck.” Exum also gets out of the vehicle, and five gunshots are heard off-camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez said she stopped her Rogue but feared being “manhandled” by the agents, so she drove away. She said she drove to her “farthest left” to avoid the agents climbing out of their vehicle on her right. But as she passed, she said Exum opened fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-110000\" name=\"image-110000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/612eb0b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0850f39/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a80d80/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Charles Exum text message\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a80d80/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e5c3f8a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a80d80/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text messages by Border Patrol agent Charles Exum after the Oct. 4 shooting of Marimar Martinez in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney’s office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exum wrote in a text message that his superiors had been supportive after the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has been including Chief Bovino, Chief Banks, Sec Noem and El Jefe himself … according to Bovino,” Exum wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agent even shared a text from someone in Vermont.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;It said,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“good job brother, glad you are unharmed and get to live to tell the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You are a legend among agents you better f---in know that.

Now [Liam] can get back to wrestling.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly, an Illinois recruit, won the Class 3A 157-pound title last season and has competed at 165 pounds this season. He has had a non-contagious skin condition — granuloma annulare — on his upper arms since his freshman year. A doctor had filled out the IHSA's Required Medical Form, which has allowed him to compete uninterrupted until Morton officials blocked him from wrestling in the regional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five days later, Kelly was allowed to wrestle for the Caravan at the Marmion Dual-Team Sectional and pinned his opponent at 190 pounds in 16 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Caravan were eliminated from team competition with a 46-23 loss to Marmion, but now Kelly is back in the individual bracket. He won't be taking anyone's spot in the 165-pound bracket in Hinsdale Central, but will be added as a 13th competitor in what is usually a 12-wrestler bracket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top four finishers at each weight in the sectionals advance to the state finals at State Farm Center in Champaign on Feb. 19-21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her ruling, Conlon noted the IHSA did not explain why Morton officials wouldn't let Kelly compete, while other schools did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conlon also wrote \"there is no health or safety risk\" that would arise from him competing \"as evidenced by the Required Medical Forms and the record.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney Steve Glink, who represented Michael Kelly, told the Sun-Times: \"I wish the IHSA had voluntarily corrected it, but I'm glad the judge did the right thing.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mount Carmel athletic director Phil Segroves also applauded the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We're grateful,\" he told the Sun-Times. \"We feel this is going to end the right way. Liam should be wrestling. He's handled this ... with the utmost class.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IHSA official did not respond to a message seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;",

Only six NFL teams had fewer pressures than the Commanders did last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Saints — Notre Dame RB Jeremiyah Love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The franchise that drafted Reggie Bush and Alvin Kamara will pass the torch from the latter to the Notre Dame star to help quarterback Tyler Shough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;9.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Chiefs — Arizona State WR Jordyn Tyson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Chiefs need more offensive play-makers, be it Love or Tyson, who fought through injuries in each of his past three college seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;10.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Bengals — Ohio State S Caleb Downs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be irresponsible to give the Bengals anyone but a defender. Like the Bengals, they lean on the state university to answer their biggest problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;11.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Dolphins — Tennessee CB Jermod McCoy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Dolphins have a defensive-minded head coach in Jeff Hafley and two starting outside cornerbacks who are set to become free agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;12.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Cowboys — Auburn EDGE Keldric Faulk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Cowboys double down on their biggest mistake of last year, trading Micah Parsons, by reaching a bit to land Faulk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;13.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Rams (via Falcons) — LSU CB Mansoor Delane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With an embarrassment of riches at the offensive skill positions, the Rams turn their attention to defense with their first of two first-round picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;14.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ravens — USC WR Makai Lemon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year, Zay Flowers became the first Ravens receiver ever (who wasn’t primarily a returner) picked to the Pro Bowl this year. They need more help, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;15.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Buccaneers — Ohio State LB Sonny Styles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;He makes sense for the Bucs whether or not veteran Lavonte David decides to return for another season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;16.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Jets (via Colts) — Alabama QB Ty Simpson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Jets, as of now, are trapped in quarterback hell. If they don’t add a veteran to climb out (Kyler Murray? Tua Tagovailoa?) they have to take a swing here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;17.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Lions — Alabama T Kadyn Proctor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taylor Decker is weighing whether or not to retire. If he does, the Lions need to find his replacement, whether it’s in the draft or free agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;18.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Vikings — Toledo S Emmanuel McNeil-Warren&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Vikings’ tribute to safety Harrison Smith at the end of the season might have foretold his retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;19.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Panthers — Texas A&amp;amp;M EDGE Cashius Howell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only the Jets and 49ers had fewer sacks than the Panthers did last season. Howell, who has 27 career sacks, can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;20.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Cowboys (via Packers) — Miami EDGE Akheem Mesidor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Cowboys wouldn’t draft two edge rushers in Round 1, right? Right? Their top three pass rushers, per Pro Football Focus, are 27 or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;21.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Steelers — Washington WR Denzel Boston&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mike McCarthy needs to give the Steelers quarterback (Aaron Rodgers again?) young, reliable targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;22.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Chargers — Penn State G Olaivavega Ioane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jim Harbaugh loves setting the tone on the offensive line, and Ioane can do just that for the Bolts’ head coach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;23.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Eagles —&amp;nbsp;Clemson CB Avieon Terrell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question isn’t whether Terrell is worthy —&amp;nbsp;it’s whether the Eagles would spend a first-round pick on someone who’d be their third cornerback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;24.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Browns (via Jaguars) — Arizona State T Max Iheanachor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iheanachor was born in Nigeria and didn’t play football until junior college. He’s the kind of gamble that teams with two first-round picks can afford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;25.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Bears —&amp;nbsp;Clemson EDGE T.J. Parker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Bears have two primary offseason needs that are independent of their ability to re-sign their own free agents: left tackle and edge rusher. In this scenario, Parker — and, as a close second, Missouri defensive end Zion Young — is the best available player at one of those two spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parker had 11 sacks in 2024 but posted only five last year. He was one of the standouts of the Senior Bowl, though, eager to prove that his high-end production was no fluke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears need both talent and depth on the edges, and figure to eye trades and free agency to fix the problem first. Drafting Parker would give the Bears a chance to find a long-term solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;26.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Bills —&amp;nbsp;Clemson DT Peter Woods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the Bills are comfortable with his Woods’ shorter-than-ideal arms, he’d make sense on a defensive line that needs help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;27.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 49ers — Missouri EDGE Zion Young&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 49ers had the third-worst pressure percentage in the NFL last year and will need to give new coordinator Raheem Morris some pass-rush oomph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;28.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Texans —&amp;nbsp;Ohio State DT Kayden McDonald&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;McDonald, who was given PFF’s best run grade in FBS last year, could help keep the Texans’ defense atop the league.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;29.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Rams — Tennessee CB Colton Hood&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Rams take their second cornerback of the round in an attempt to shore up their defense to try Cto win perhaps the NFL’s toughest division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;30.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Broncos — Oregon TE Kenyon Sadiq&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Broncos reunite Sadiq with quarterback Bo Nix, his teammate on the 2023 version of the Ducks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;31.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Patriots — Utah T Caleb Lomu&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Pats say they won’t move last year’s first-round pick, Will Campbell, off left tackle. Lomu can play on the right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;32.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Seahawks — San Diego State CB Chris Johnson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The champs have three pending free agents at cornerback and could fill a need if either of Coby Bryant, Riq Woolen or Josh Jobe leave.&lt;/p&gt;",

It has been a lonely transition. One of my friends from school, \"Skip,\" has helped, but more and more, he dominates social situations by framing what people first learn about me and my husband. It is usually unflattering or one-dimensional, or he'll include me in a one-time event story but make it sound like it was my whole life, which it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skip also dominates a conversation and always has to be right. This interferes with our meeting other people, and it leaves my husband feeling alienated and even more alone. He would like to meet and have conversations with new people, but Skip doesn't take it well when I try to explain that his behavior is stifling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I pull back, or try to broach the subject of allowing my husband and me to interact with new people without Skip framing who we are before we meet them? — &lt;i&gt;MISREPRESENTED IN THE MIDWEST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR MISREPRESENTED:&lt;/b&gt; Carve out time for you and your husband to socialize independently from your old \"friend,\" who does not seem like much of a friend from where I'm sitting. Use that time to look into volunteering opportunities for yourself and your husband, separately if necessary, and joining other social or special interest groups. If you do, those folks will have the opportunity to meet the real you, and your husband may begin to feel less isolated. Please don't wait to start, because if you do, your husband may become depressed from the continued social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My husband has two grown children from his first marriage and two grandchildren. When I met him, he was still in what he described as a very unhappy and unhealthy marriage of 30 years. Because of this, his family has labeled me a homewrecker. While his children are polite and cordial, we don't have any kind of relationship with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My husband feels that for every holiday, we must host his children for some portion of the day, after which they can go be with their mother and other family. I don't think I should have to open up my home and cook for people who don't like me. Could you please provide me with some guidance? — &lt;i&gt;LOOKING FOR WHAT'S FAIR&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR LOOKING:&lt;/b&gt; Please consider a change in attitude. You stated that your husband's children are polite and cordial with you. They may not dislike you as much as fear that getting too close to you might alienate their mother. Your husband should be able to invite his children into the home you share if he wishes, and the atmosphere should be as warm and welcoming as you can manage. (\"Kill them with kindness.\")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is a lot of work involved, your husband should help you with it if he can. If you can manage to do this, you may be able to improve the relationship you have with your stepchildren, which will benefit everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

By that point, most Americans &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/514007/grassroots-support-legalizing-marijuana-hits-record.aspx\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;opposed&lt;/a&gt; pot prohibition, and that majority has &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/697445/americans-positive-progress-drugs.aspx\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;grown&lt;/a&gt; since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the Times does not regret endorsing legalization, its editorial board &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/09/opinion/regulate-legalized-marijuana.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;now says&lt;/a&gt; stricter regulation and heavier taxation are necessary to curtail the costs associated with marijuana abuse. Those recommendations elide two inconvenient facts: Cannabis is still federally prohibited, and states are still struggling to replace unauthorized pot peddlers with government-licensed marijuana merchants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times emphasizes that \"occasional marijuana use is no more a problem than drinking a glass of wine with dinner or smoking a celebratory cigar.\" But while marijuana \"is safer than alcohol and tobacco in some ways,\" the Times says, \"it is not harmless.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequent cannabis consumption has increased substantially in recent years, the Times notes, and roughly 1 in 10 marijuana users \"develops an addiction.\" Even nonaddicted cannabis consumers \"can still use it too much,\" it says, since \"people who are frequently stoned can struggle to hold a job or take care of their families.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-810000\" name=\"module-810000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times also mentions &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21665-cannabis-hyperemesis-syndrome\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, \"marijuana-linked paranoia\" and the danger posed by &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://reason.com/2019/04/19/the-hunt-for-stoned-drivers/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;stoned drivers&lt;/a&gt;. \"Any product that brings both pleasures and problems requires a balancing act,\" the Times says, which means \"personal freedom\" must be curtailed to protect \"public health.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That formulation is inherently &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://reason.com/2007/05/17/an-epidemic-of-meddling/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;paternalistic&lt;/a&gt;, since the \"public health\" burden to which the Times refers is borne mainly by cannabis consumers themselves. And the moral logic of the hefty marijuana taxes that the Times favors is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those taxes would add to the difficulties that some heavy consumers face while punishing the occasional use that the paper says is no big deal. Although \"adults should have the freedom to use\" marijuana, the Times says, they must pay the government for that privilege.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tax-based \"balancing act\" also raises practical difficulties. \"The first step in a strategy to reduce marijuana abuse should be a federal tax on pot,\" the Times says, gliding over the point that Congress cannot impose an excise tax on marijuana products unless it is prepared to legalize them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The editorial does not explicitly acknowledge the need for that step. To the contrary, it implicitly criticizes President Donald Trump's &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/18/trump-orders-the-expeditious-reclassification-of-marijuana/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; to reclassify marijuana under federal law, which &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/15/trumps-plan-to-reclassify-marijuana-would-leave-federal-prohibition-essentially-untouched/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;falls far short&lt;/a&gt; of legalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That change, the Times complains, \"will increase the profits\" of \"Big Weed\" by &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://harrisbricken.com/cannalawblog/three-myths-and-three-facts-on-the-huge-marijuana-rescheduling-recommendation/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;allowing&lt;/a&gt; marijuana businesses to claim standard deductions on their income tax returns, eliminating a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://reason.com/2025/12/15/trumps-plan-to-reclassify-marijuana-would-leave-federal-prohibition-essentially-untouched/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;crushing financial disadvantage&lt;/a&gt; that has long plagued them. Although the Times sees that as self-evidently bad, the upshot is that state-licensed marijuana suppliers will be treated the same as every other legal business, which hardly seems like a special favor to the cannabis industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times also thinks states should increase their own marijuana taxes, which would create new obstacles on the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://reason.org/commentary/californias-legal-marijuana-industry-has-been-hard-pressed-to-compete-with-untaxed-unregulated-providers/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;bumpy road&lt;/a&gt; to a legal market. Despite &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.marijuanamoment.net/new-york-marijuana-sales-near-1-5-billion-total-as-number-of-stores-nearly-tripled-last-year-state-report-says/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;recent progress&lt;/a&gt;, licensed marijuana merchants in New York account for perhaps a quarter of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/feature_article/can-nys-legal-stores-compete-with-an-eight-billion-dollar-illicit-market/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;estimated total sales&lt;/a&gt;, while the legal share in California is pegged at just &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://sbp.senate.ca.gov/system/files/2025-03/2-dcc-report-on-the-condition-and-health-of-the-cannabis-industry.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;40%&lt;/a&gt; nearly a decade after that state legalized recreational use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of higher state taxes with a new federal tax will not make this transition any easier. Yet the Times argues that taxes \"high enough to deter excessive use\" would be \"on the scale of dollars per joint,\" which represents a huge increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times says that level of taxation would be consistent with the late drug policy scholar Mark Kleiman's &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/20027121.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;1992 vision&lt;/a&gt; of \"grudging toleration\" for marijuana use. Kleiman also imagined bolder steps, including monthly purchase limits and consumption licenses that could be revoked when marijuana users misbehave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions of fairness aside, such policies would pose serious enforcement challenges and compound the disadvantages that licensed pot suppliers face in competing with untaxed and unregulated dealers. This does not sound like a formula for making legalization work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jacob Sullum is a senior editor at Reason magazine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-760000\" name=\"module-760000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

If co-owner Anna Niziołek is around, she will educate newcomers on the pronunciation (“two PAWNCH-key but one PAWN-chek”), the origins and the process of making pączki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She will gently correct those who call her pączki doughnuts and is quick to explain that they don't sell them with custard, chocolate or other fillings. The original filling — a mix of plum, rose and raspberry marmalades imported from Poland — is hand-folded into the dough before frying, rather than injected afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our pączki are special because we make them fresh every day from scratch by hand, using a very old Polish recipe,” Niziołek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-810000\" name=\"image-810000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6bcf360/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5803x3257+0+306/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1f%2F47%2Fccd3b3804938b40029db419b8aae%2Fpaczkiday-260217-6.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3e0ec7f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5803x3257+0+306/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1f%2F47%2Fccd3b3804938b40029db419b8aae%2Fpaczkiday-260217-6.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c42995/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5803x3257+0+306/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1f%2F47%2Fccd3b3804938b40029db419b8aae%2Fpaczkiday-260217-6.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"An employee cuts dough to make paczki at Polish Paczki Cafe in Norwood Park, Saturday, Jan. 31, 2026. | Pat Nabong/Sun-Times\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c42995/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5803x3257+0+306/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1f%2F47%2Fccd3b3804938b40029db419b8aae%2Fpaczkiday-260217-6.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7b89ecf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5803x3257+0+306/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1f%2F47%2Fccd3b3804938b40029db419b8aae%2Fpaczkiday-260217-6.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c42995/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5803x3257+0+306/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1f%2F47%2Fccd3b3804938b40029db419b8aae%2Fpaczkiday-260217-6.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our pączki are special because we make them fresh every day from scratch by hand, using a very old Polish recipe,” Niziołek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the kitchen, workers spill the dough from a mixer bowl onto a large countertop dusted with flour. The aroma of sweet rising yeast fills the air. The dough looks light, soft and plump, but also rich and yellow. One woman quickly and skillfully cuts chunks of dough with a round, cup-like cutter, while another rapidly pipes the brownish marmalade onto the pieces. Several others deftly fold the dough around the jam, shaping it into medium buns, and place them seam-side down on a baking sheet to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many pączki are fried, and when, depends on the length of the line in the store. Here pączki never sit on display. Still warm, they are glazed with a mixture of lemon juice and powdered sugar, topped with orange zest, packed in boxes and taken straight to the customer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recipe comes from Niziołek’s mother. Niziołek first introduced it at Old Warsaw Buffet in Harwood Heights, where she started working in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-0b0000\" name=\"image-0b0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9ba6358/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5067x2844+0+267/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2Fb7%2Fbd333eb145eab5239756d67f9b81%2Fpaczkiday-260217-5.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5f92cbf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5067x2844+0+267/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2Fb7%2Fbd333eb145eab5239756d67f9b81%2Fpaczkiday-260217-5.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d8baf9f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5067x2844+0+267/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2Fb7%2Fbd333eb145eab5239756d67f9b81%2Fpaczkiday-260217-5.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Owner Anna Niziolek shapes the paczki dough at Polish Paczki Cafe in Norwood Park, Saturday, Jan. 31, 2026. | Pat Nabong/Sun-Times\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d8baf9f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5067x2844+0+267/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2Fb7%2Fbd333eb145eab5239756d67f9b81%2Fpaczkiday-260217-5.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/35967c6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5067x2844+0+267/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2Fb7%2Fbd333eb145eab5239756d67f9b81%2Fpaczkiday-260217-5.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d8baf9f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5067x2844+0+267/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2Fb7%2Fbd333eb145eab5239756d67f9b81%2Fpaczkiday-260217-5.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polish Pączki Cafe’s recipe calls for a few ingredients — sugar, yeast, milk, eggs, butter and flour, and a pinch of salt — But the details matter.

Decades later, Niziołek recalled, when her mother, Janina, visited her at the Old Warsaw, she would inspect her pączki and give suggestions on how to refine the formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recipe is surprisingly simple. It calls for sugar, yeast, milk, eggs, butter and flour, and a pinch of salt. But the details matter. Butter is imported from Poland, flour is sifted, yeast is fresh, only egg yolks are used and a splash of alcohol (preferably Polish spirytus) is added to “cut the grease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-be0000\" name=\"image-be0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e0d1662/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6428x3608+0+339/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdd%2Ff1%2F604b06d64b95be5102e590627f28%2Fpaczkiday-260217-15.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cce4b5d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6428x3608+0+339/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdd%2Ff1%2F604b06d64b95be5102e590627f28%2Fpaczkiday-260217-15.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/476e04a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6428x3608+0+339/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdd%2Ff1%2F604b06d64b95be5102e590627f28%2Fpaczkiday-260217-15.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Paczki is fried at Polish Paczki Cafe in Norwood Park, Saturday, Jan. 31, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/476e04a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6428x3608+0+339/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdd%2Ff1%2F604b06d64b95be5102e590627f28%2Fpaczkiday-260217-15.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/42527d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6428x3608+0+339/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdd%2Ff1%2F604b06d64b95be5102e590627f28%2Fpaczkiday-260217-15.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/476e04a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6428x3608+0+339/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdd%2Ff1%2F604b06d64b95be5102e590627f28%2Fpaczkiday-260217-15.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many pączki are fried, and when, depends on the length of the line in the store.

The owners said they haven’t raised it this year, but they may be forced to do so at any moment due to the rising cost of ingredients. They also vow not to change their recipe, their handmade process or to introduce other fillings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They won’t be our pączki anymore,” Zakrzewski said. “They will be just like everyone else’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preparation for Fat Thursday starts the morning the day before, when the restaurant pauses regular service and makes a few thousand handmade pączki over 36 hours straight. Overnight, up to two dozen women make pączki at a few stations, while several others focus on frying, glazing and packing. The cafe will be open from 10 a.m. Wednesday through 7 p.m. Thursday, including overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-680000\" name=\"image-680000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/23e2323/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+369/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F7d%2F87aece434847accf51ac0417dd9b%2Fpaczkiday-260217-12.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f10ea9c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+369/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F7d%2F87aece434847accf51ac0417dd9b%2Fpaczkiday-260217-12.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7248c0a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+369/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F7d%2F87aece434847accf51ac0417dd9b%2Fpaczkiday-260217-12.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"PACZKIDAY_260217_12.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7248c0a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+369/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F7d%2F87aece434847accf51ac0417dd9b%2Fpaczkiday-260217-12.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/745b473/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+369/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F7d%2F87aece434847accf51ac0417dd9b%2Fpaczkiday-260217-12.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7248c0a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+369/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb0%2F7d%2F87aece434847accf51ac0417dd9b%2Fpaczkiday-260217-12.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owners Anna Niziolek (left) and Bozena Zakrzewski (second from left) shape paczki dough with their employees at Polish Pączki Cafe.

For those trying to cut on calories, there’s always a baked option, also offered at the Polish Pączki Cafe, along with other pastries. But original pączki are a must here.&lt;/p&gt;",

The goal, it reads, is to emphasize \"American exceptionalism\" and remove what the Trump administration calls \"partisan narratives.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials have warned federal funding could be withheld if the museums don't comply. But the directive has prompted resignations and high-profile artist cancellations, such as by painter Amy Sherald.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a moment of “incredible upheaval,” says Sarah Newman, the James Dicke Curator of Contemporary Art and acting head curator at SAAM, “Nick is proposing a way to navigate through that change, a way to look at our environment and our heritage, take solace in it, honor and learn from it, and look toward creativity as a way to locate your place in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 67, Cave is best known for &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/culture-the-arts/2022/05/19/artist-nick-cave-and-his-soundsuits-take-over-chicago-mca-dusable\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;his Soundsuits,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; folkloric, futuristic sculptural forms that blur the line between costume and armor. Sometimes glittering, other times spectral, the suits evoke both Maurice Sendak’s “wild things” and the heightened drama of Schiaparelli couture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cave began making the Soundsuits in 1991 in response to the brutal Los Angeles Police Department beating of Rodney King, a Black man whose assault ignited the 1992 L.A. riots, and national outrage, over police brutality. Since then, Cave estimates he has made nearly 500 suits, each an expression of his expansive, inimitable imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-1f0000\" name=\"image-1f0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7e611bb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc6%2F65%2Fd4e047f24b38b276a0b8c579067e%2F7i6a8158.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4672858/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc6%2F65%2Fd4e047f24b38b276a0b8c579067e%2F7i6a8158.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bdd5d0d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc6%2F65%2Fd4e047f24b38b276a0b8c579067e%2F7i6a8158.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Nick Cave&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;Soundsuits&amp;quot; series at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bdd5d0d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc6%2F65%2Fd4e047f24b38b276a0b8c579067e%2F7i6a8158.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/262e018/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc6%2F65%2Fd4e047f24b38b276a0b8c579067e%2F7i6a8158.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bdd5d0d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc6%2F65%2Fd4e047f24b38b276a0b8c579067e%2F7i6a8158.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cave is best known for his Soundsuits, folkloric, futuristic sculptural forms that blur the line between costume and armor.

He is a professor of fashion studies at the School of the Art Institute and has exhibited widely across the United States, including major solo exhibitions at the Guggenheim, MASS MoCA, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, one of Cave’s Soundsuits is currently on view at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago as part of the show, “City in a Garden: Queer Art and Activism in Chicago.” Two additional pieces hang in the Art Institute of Chicago exhibition “On Loss and Absence.” On the South Side, Cave designed the floral-inspired mosaic ceiling at the Washington Park Green Line stop and will unveil a new commission for the Obama Presidential Center later this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cave and his partner in life and art, Bob Faust, also run a gallery from their expansive live-work space, Facility, in Old Irving Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Cave’s work seems to dance, often literally. around overt political declarations, the artist doesn't shy from pointed critique. “Is the work somewhat political?” Cave asks, rhetorically. “Oh yeah, it’s in there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of Cave’s creations hold grief and celebration, agony and ecstasy, in equal measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;A legacy of craftmaking and meticulous handiwork&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Cave, the Smithsonian show began with a personal excavation. “I started thinking, how was I made?” says Cave. “How did I become who I am?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cave grew up one of seven brothers in Missouri. Many of his favorite memories were shaped on his grandparents’ farm where he was surrounded by aunts and uncles who made things with their hands. “They were all just making stuff anyway, but didn’t call it art,” recalls Cave. “It was really just hobbies, craftsmanship. Things they did on Saturdays and Sundays.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a boy, Cave especially loved watching his grandmother work. “At seven o’clock, she would say, ‘Knick Knack, go pull my quilt out of the chest,’” he recalls, “and she would sit down and just start to quilt.” He also remembers how his grandmother would cut clothing patterns from brown paper bags, pin them directly onto one of her many grandchildren, and assemble garments in a matter of hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the making was only part of it. Pageantry mattered, too. When a quilt or painting was finished, “there would be this big reveal,” says Cave. “Something about it was magical.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"  data-align-fullBleed&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-ac0000\" name=\"image-ac0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/180c156/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0c%2Ffb%2Fd4e3aa8e4c0b927d823b715b9fac%2Fnickcave-260215-37.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/33c2350/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0c%2Ffb%2Fd4e3aa8e4c0b927d823b715b9fac%2Fnickcave-260215-37.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/28338d4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0c%2Ffb%2Fd4e3aa8e4c0b927d823b715b9fac%2Fnickcave-260215-37.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Beads that cover costume of a wooly mammoth controlled by four dancers for “Nick Cave: Mammoth” a series by artist Nick Cave during a video shoot at the Theater by the Lake at North DuSable Lakeshore Drive and West Fullerton Parkway on the lakefront, Tuesday, Jan. 13, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/28338d4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0c%2Ffb%2Fd4e3aa8e4c0b927d823b715b9fac%2Fnickcave-260215-37.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cd2db1f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0c%2Ffb%2Fd4e3aa8e4c0b927d823b715b9fac%2Fnickcave-260215-37.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/28338d4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0c%2Ffb%2Fd4e3aa8e4c0b927d823b715b9fac%2Fnickcave-260215-37.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artist is one of seven boys in a family of makers who spent their weekends stitching, beading and making things with their hands.

Cave’s mammoths also appear throughout the gallery spaces, some in full form, others reduced to skulls or tusks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show’s most intimate work, however, sprawls across a 70-foot light table. Titled “A Lit History,” the massive assemblage is created from thousands of objects — pie pans, nails, trivets, bingo ball cages, thimbles, crocheted doilies, metal coils — that Cave has collected over the last three decades, many of them from his grandparents’ house. Those unadorned, everyday items sit alongside elaborate pieces of Cave’s own invention: veils fashioned from plastic ties and price tags, hats assembled from knobbed keychain rings, and garments stitched from tens of thousands of buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It registers in two ways at once. From a distance, “A Lit History” provokes sheer bewilderment and wonder; up close, the display reveals intricate and meticulous craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nick has this unique ability to see beauty and art in things that people would otherwise be so quick to discard or not value,” says Michelle Boone, the president of the Poetry Foundation and former cultural commissioner, who has known Cave for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boone recalls a visit to the Randolph Street Market that revealed Cave’s way of seeing. She remembers passing a long wooden slab — “I think it was an African bed,” she says — and wondering aloud what anyone would ever do with it. An hour later, she saw Cave walking through the antique market with the piece tucked under his arm. When she later visited his home, the bed had become the centerpiece of his dining table. “It never would have occurred to me to see that as an art piece. The way Nick views the world is very, very different from most people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e80000\" name=\"image-e80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5cce36f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5e%2F22%2Fee1a998e489bbdab59b9a2a485a3%2F240430-5830-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cba893f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5e%2F22%2Fee1a998e489bbdab59b9a2a485a3%2F240430-5830-1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a661045/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5e%2F22%2Fee1a998e489bbdab59b9a2a485a3%2F240430-5830-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Nick Cave constructing one of his Woolly mammoths. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a661045/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5e%2F22%2Fee1a998e489bbdab59b9a2a485a3%2F240430-5830-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ef4be10/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5e%2F22%2Fee1a998e489bbdab59b9a2a485a3%2F240430-5830-1.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a661045/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4633+0+435/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5e%2F22%2Fee1a998e489bbdab59b9a2a485a3%2F240430-5830-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cave stands inside an early, spectral prototype of one of his mammoths.

One, though, stands apart as a particular talisman: a walking cane that belonged to Cave’s youngest brother, Stacy, who died at 20. In the museum gallery, “it’s the first object you encounter,” explains Cave, who placed the cane in the show without altering it. “It was his cane. I didn’t need to do anything. It was everything it needed to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that his family’s relics are now on display at the Smithsonian simply amazes Cave. “My grandmother’s thimbles are in the Smithsonian,” he smiles. “That is American history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;An artist seizes the moment &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week before “Mammoth” is set to open, Cave has just returned from Washington, D.C., where he finished installing the exhibition. A handful of studio assistants work studiously at their stations nearby. Cave employs ten full-time assistants, several of whom wore the mammoths for “Roam,” but that number can climb as high as 30 at the height of a project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the studio is quieter than it has been in months. Not only does “Mammoth” open as the Smithsonian sits at the center of the Trump administration’s anti-diversity campaign, but it also appears in a moment when stories of state violence dominate the headlines. That includes the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, news that carries a grim echo of the early days of Cave’s career when he created his first Soundsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking the studio floor, Cave pauses at a few mammoth heads that rest in a corner. He will eventually make a total of 13 mammoths — enough to form a herd — for a performance at the museum later this year. Looking at the pieces, Cave recalls the moment when the animal’s final form first came into focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cave, who made the mammoths with the Chicago metal fabrication studio, Manifold, originally imagined the creatures fully skinned. But once he saw people standing beneath an early prototype, visible through the ribs, Cave changed his mind. “Something about that just revealed the state of the world today,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-890000\" name=\"image-890000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1163266/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2Fcf%2Fa32b5dc34ae9b35f8f72ac504cdf%2Fnickcave-260215-30.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7336e5d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2Fcf%2Fa32b5dc34ae9b35f8f72ac504cdf%2Fnickcave-260215-30.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c677fc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2Fcf%2Fa32b5dc34ae9b35f8f72ac504cdf%2Fnickcave-260215-30.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Dancers donning the mammoth costume walk past for the video portion of “Nick Cave: Mammoth”  a series by artist Nick Cave during a video shoot near the Theater by the Lake at North DuSable Lakeshore Drive and West Fullerton Parkway on the lakefront, Tuesday, Jan. 13, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c677fc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2Fcf%2Fa32b5dc34ae9b35f8f72ac504cdf%2Fnickcave-260215-30.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5f59c8f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2Fcf%2Fa32b5dc34ae9b35f8f72ac504cdf%2Fnickcave-260215-30.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c677fc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2Fcf%2Fa32b5dc34ae9b35f8f72ac504cdf%2Fnickcave-260215-30.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nick has this unique ability to see beauty and art in things that people would otherwise be so quick to discard or not value,” says Michelle Boone, the president of the Poetry Foundation and former cultural commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing this work to Washington now, adds Cave, only sharpens the stakes.

We will not change the show.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition may have been nearly a decade in the making, but Cave believes the work is arriving in the world exactly when it’s meant to. “I believe I’m not ever given anything that I’m not supposed to have at any given moment,” reflects Cave. “So,” he adds, “I have a job to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Elly Fishman’s reporting on news and culture has appeared in The New York Times, Rolling Stone, GQ, Fast Company, Chicago, and WBEZ, among others.

Students, both from immigrant families and their peers, say the heightened environment left them looking over their shoulders and unable to concentrate on schoolwork, frequently glancing at classroom doors or worrying about family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also placed an unprecedented burden on school principals and district officials, who had to ensure timely communication with families without sowing fear or spreading rumors. Community members say coordination with CPS was difficult at first and eventually improved, but the district still faces a big challenge if widespread enforcement returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we are where we need to be,” said Patrick Brosnan, executive director of the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, a nonprofit on the Southwest Side that works closely with schools. He credits the school district for making adjustments to confront what he calls a “bananas” situation. At the same time, he said the school district and the city still needs to share information more freely and promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no blueprint for this, but we are going through it,” added Yesenia Lopez, a CPS board member whose heavily Latino district on the city’s Southwest Side has been a hotspot for enforcement operations. “Things keep escalating based on what we’ve seen out in other states and we're going to have to continue to act quickly as a district.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Widespread disruption when federal agents came near Chicago schools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Trump’s Chicago-area deportation campaign was at its peak last fall, schools reported federal immigration agents staging in school parking lots, showing up at elementary school soccer games, and detaining people on school grounds or where students could see them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Oct. 3, students had to stay inside when federal agents &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/10/09/funston-elementary-logan-square-school-tear-gas-johnson\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;threw tear gas on the street near Funston Elementary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Logan Square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the exact number of times federal activity disrupted schools isn’t known, it’s clear the effect was widespread. The Sun-Times and WBEZ compiled the most comprehensive accounting to date by reviewing district briefings for school board members and records of letters CPS sent to families informing them about federal activity near their schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS received nearly 200 calls for support from 109 schools between Oct. 20, when it opened a command center to centralize calls for assistance, through mid-December, according to CPS documents obtained through an open records request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-190000\" name=\"html-embed-module-190000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27483195\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27483195/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s likely an underestimate of how often agents came near schools, as principals often acted without reaching out to the central office and the command center launched more than a month into the deportation campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS officials did not agree to an interview, but said in a statement that federal activity on school grounds is extremely rare and the district has mostly responded to reports of activity near school buildings. Over the last year, there have been no known instances of enforcement activity inside a CPS school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, schools called the command center for help nearly every day in October and early November. On some days, CPS fielded dozens of calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, when federal agents flooded the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/immigration/2025/10/24/immigration-agents-arrest-lake-view-protest-tear-gas-west-town\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;North and Northwest sides on Oct. 24,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the command center got 37 calls from schools seeking help — the most recorded by the district this fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 10 schools thought the situation this fall posed enough of a safety risk to staff and students that they went on lockdown, according to a log of messages the district sent to parents. That means they kept students indoors and secured the doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North-Grand High School in Humboldt Park went on lockdown in early September after receiving reports of several suspected law enforcement vehicles in the parking lot of an adjacent shopping center. CPS officials couldn’t verify who the vehicles belonged to, but students assumed federal immigration agents were using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-1d0000\" name=\"image-1d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a8ef4cb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+58/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F45%2F998d0d6c4f8a88298eed661a193f%2Fcpslockdowns-260128-9.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/983bf59/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+58/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F45%2F998d0d6c4f8a88298eed661a193f%2Fcpslockdowns-260128-9.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ec3b09/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+58/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F45%2F998d0d6c4f8a88298eed661a193f%2Fcpslockdowns-260128-9.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A group of eight students wearing coats and backpacks walk in a line by a parking lot separated from the road by a black fence.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ec3b09/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+58/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F45%2F998d0d6c4f8a88298eed661a193f%2Fcpslockdowns-260128-9.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b89e645/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+58/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F45%2F998d0d6c4f8a88298eed661a193f%2Fcpslockdowns-260128-9.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ec3b09/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+58/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F45%2F998d0d6c4f8a88298eed661a193f%2Fcpslockdowns-260128-9.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When suspected law enforcement vehicles showed up in a parking lot near North-Grand High School in Humboldt Park, the school went on lockdown.

We’re not using her real name because some of her family members are immigrants without legal status in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That day the North-Grand junior sent panicked texts to her relatives, telling them to avoid the school. She started to cry when she didn’t get a response, worried that she’d sent the warning too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was texting my mother that I loved her so much,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the lockdown, Carrie decided to stay home from school for a few days. Coming back meant working through her anxieties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the experience left a mark. She’s still on high alert while she’s in class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I look more at the door, I pay attention to who is at the doorway, who is leaving, who is in my classroom and who could be walking the halls,” Carrie said. “I memorized some of my friend’s footstep patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon for fears about the presence of immigration agents to weigh heavily on children’s minds, psychologists say. They may become more emotional, distrust authority and have trouble sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We may be asking them to take their history exam during the ninth period when their mind is worried about the commute home,” said Claudio Rivera, a pediatric psychologist and an assistant professor at the University of Chicago. “That’s not allowing them to focus on the learning opportunities that’s in front of them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact number of schools that went on lockdown during the fall is likely higher as the district doesn’t comprehensively track them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, for example, Brosnan told Chalkbeat Chicago that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chalkbeat.org/chicago/2025/10/23/chicago-public-schools-board-members-want-virtual-learning-immigration/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;about 30 schools on the Southwest Side&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; alone went on lockdown because of enforcement activity. Lopez, whose district includes Brighton Park, said that’s partly because federal agents frequently &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/09/27/tamale-vendor-arrested-back-of-the-yards-ice-immigration\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;stalked the Home Depot in neighboring Back of the Yards&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is surrounded by several schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-900000\" name=\"image-900000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fb706c0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fa5%2F7b931de947e78ba7b153e723478c%2Fcpslockdowns-260205-01.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/40e51f9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fa5%2F7b931de947e78ba7b153e723478c%2Fcpslockdowns-260205-01.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/395621e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fa5%2F7b931de947e78ba7b153e723478c%2Fcpslockdowns-260205-01.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A teen with long hair wearing a blue winter jacket stands outside her school with the lawn behind her covered in snow.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/395621e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fa5%2F7b931de947e78ba7b153e723478c%2Fcpslockdowns-260205-01.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/02a6fe5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fa5%2F7b931de947e78ba7b153e723478c%2Fcpslockdowns-260205-01.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/395621e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fa5%2F7b931de947e78ba7b153e723478c%2Fcpslockdowns-260205-01.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia Markut, a junior at Lane Tech High School, saw how the presence of federal immigration agents near her school affected her classmates’ mental health and made some students afraid to leave the building for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Lane Tech High School in the North Center neighborhood, junior Julia Markut said her peers were surprised when in October a loudspeaker message alerted them of federal immigration enforcement activity nearby. She watched in shock as one of her friends broke down in tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her friend said: “I don’t know how I'll be able to get home, I have to call my parents,” Markut said. “It was sort of dehumanizing to see her experiencing that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon the loudspeaker alerts were coming multiple times a week, making the situation almost “normalized,” Markut said. The school started encouraging students, many of whom like to go out for lunch, to stay inside. It opened classrooms where students who are afraid to leave can find refuge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Julia thinks it shouldn't have to be this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This fear shouldn't be incorporated into our routines,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to multiple requests to answer specific questions about federal activity around Chicago schools. The agency has said &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/09/19/suburban-parents-sound-alarm-on-immigration-enforcement-around-schools\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;its agents do not target schools&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Schools had to develop communications playbook around federal activity &lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unpredictability of immigration enforcement actions made it difficult for CPS to figure out how and when to tell families about activity near schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kia Banks, president of the Chicago Principals &amp;amp; Administrators Association, the union that represents CPS principals, said in the past schools initiated lockdowns following a set protocol, usually in response to something like a shooting, and coordinated with the Chicago Police Department and the school district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that protocol was turned on its head when federal agents repeatedly came near schools. Community organizations and schools were alerting CPS, rather than the other way around, and coordinating with the district to get communication out to parents could take hours. So, especially in the early days of the federal immigration operation, many Chicago principals made their own calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no playbook for how to manage this level of an emergency,” Banks said. “You are burdened with the responsibility of protecting your school community and you do that any way you know how.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Graves, principal at Jordan Elementary School in Rogers Park, knows how that felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his community, parents were finding out about immigration enforcement through their own networks or by listening to the whistles from neighborhood spotters. Waiting two hours to get permission from CPS to notify families about federal immigration agents in the area was too long, he said. He learned families preferred if the school acknowledged the situation in real time, even if it was to say that the sighting of agents was not confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-e00000\" name=\"html-embed-module-e00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\" data-src=\"visualisation/27482980\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27482980/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"map visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That helped create a lot of sense of calm, because families saw that we were constantly messaging something,” Graves said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district eventually gave school leaders clearer guidance about how to handle immigration enforcement activity near their buildings. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/78/b0/f53090534ffba3c272f450ff45e5/october-2025-cps-guidance.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Introduced in October&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it instructs school leaders to bring students and staff inside and secure doors if federal activity is happening on the same block. If it's further away, they should monitor the activity. That’s something community members and rapid response teams can help with, Lopez noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School board members and principals say communication improved once schools had a single hotline to call and the district gave school leaders the go-ahead to use their own judgment to act quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steps like this have helped students like eighth grader Dennise Marioni at Gunsaulus Scholastic Academy. Parents said the Brighton Park school kept students indoors multiple times last fall, but Marioni said clear communication from the school kept her calm. In addition, staff often set up a perimeter around the school during dismissal or arrival to monitor for federal agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re keeping us safe,” Marioni said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS noted in a statement that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cps.edu/services-and-supports/new-presidential-administration-guidance/immigration-resources\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;district staff and school leaders worked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to “make rapid, real-time decisions in response to evolving conditions outside school campuses.” The district trained staff on how to respond to enforcement campaigns in the spring of 2025, and repeated the training in the fall when actions ramped up. CPS has also provided guidance to staff on what to do if a student’s parent or guardian is detained during the school day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The District acknowledges that these circumstances placed extraordinary demands on principals and central office staff, who worked diligently to keep students safe while also communicating accurately and responsibly with families,” a CPS spokesperson wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lopez said while CPS did make great strides during an unprecedented event, the district could be more proactive in preparing for the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/12/04/doj-lawyer-warns-midway-blitz-is-not-over-as-judge-considers-lawsuits-dismissal\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;possible return of widespread enforcement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

There, federal agents detained a 5-year-old boy &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/us/valley-view-elementary-minnesota-children-ice-detention.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;on the way home from school&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and deployed chemical irritants and tackled several people &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/08/after-border-patrol-clash-at-roosevelt-minneapolis-schools-cancel-classes\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;at a high school&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in south Minneapolis. Closer to home, masked federal agents scanned the face of a 16-year-old outside an Aurora high school, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/News-Room/Current-News/001%20-%20Complaint%201.12.26.pdf?language_id=1\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;according to court records&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can give agents access to sensitive personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration also has told federal agents that they have broad powers to arrest people without warrants and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/us/politics/ice-expands-power-agents-warrants.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;enter homes with a warrant that hasn’t been signed by a judge.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; That’s left Chicago principals wanting more guidance from the district if federal agents apply that logic to schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Urban, a special education teacher at North-Grand High School, said teachers have tried not to let the situation affect their classrooms, but it’s been difficult to ignore.

Celina Villanueva filed a bill to bring Illinois into compliance with a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that deemed it unconstitutional for property owners to lose the surplus equity they are entitled to once their property has been foreclosed due to delinquent taxes and after the debt has been paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villanueva did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the current system, if property taxes are unpaid, Illinois law allows counties to sell those tax certificates at an annual tax sale to recoup the revenue they hoped to get from property taxes. Investors, or tax buyers, buy the certificates, and tack on fees and interest that property owners must redeem, or pay, in order to keep their property. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If property owners don’t pay within two-and-a-half to three years, tax buyers can go to court and pursue the deed of the property to make back what they paid. That’s where the issue lies. Properties could have equity far greater than the amount of the delinquent taxes, and the courts have ruled that property owners are entitled to it, according to the United States Constitution. But with the way things are now, investors get that equity after a tax foreclosure because they possess the deed. Property owners often have to vacate the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new system, in lieu of a tax sale, property owners will still have three years to settle their property tax debt. However, if they haven’t by that time, “the county would have to petition the court for a tax deed, and that property would get looped through a foreclosure auction to the highest bidder,” according to Justin Kirvan, the policy director in the Cook County Treasurer’s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone, including the property owners, can bid in the auction. The minimum bid would be set at the amount of the delinquent taxes owed to the county, Kirvan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation is powered by a coalition of housing advocates called the Tyler v. Hennepin Coalition, to lead the charge of ensuring that Illinois complied with a Supreme Court ruling under that same case. The group includes the Cook County Treasurer’s Office, the Cook County President’s Office, the Chicago Community Trust, Housing Action Illinois, Neighborhood Housing Services, and AARP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This legislation, at minimum, will have protections in place for folks who are the most vulnerable to ensure their equity is still protected in a tax sale,” said Torrence Gardener, manager of policy change at the Chicago Community Trust. “Justice is definitely needed at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois is the only state that has not yet formally changed its property tax sale rules to align with the Supreme Court ruling, according to Kirvan. And there have been consequences. In a December 2025 &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/12/10/cook-county-homeowners-property-tax-sales-foreclosures-illegal-federal-judge\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;ruling&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Kidd v. Pappas, U.S. District Judge Matthew F. Kennelly issued a summary judgment that Cook County’s “tax sale procedures violate the Fifth and Eighth Amendments” of the United States Constitution. The case is a class-action lawsuit starting with a west suburban Maywood homeowner who lost her home in a tax foreclosure sale, and did not receive the surplus equity that was owed to her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SB 3940 will effectively impact the investors’ interest in the tax sales, and Kirvan believes they may not favor the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think tax buyers would view this remedy as impacting their profits negatively because they won’t be able to take tax deeds free and clear with any equity that comes with the deed any longer under this legislation,” Kirvan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement from the Illinois Tax Purchasers Association, the group said it recognizes “the ongoing discussion around potential changes to Illinois law following Tyler v. Hennepin County and looks forward to continuing to work with Senator Villanueva, Representative Tarver, and other stakeholders on thoughtful, workable solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Rep. Curtis Tarver is the chairperson of the Illinois House Revenue &amp;amp; Finance Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The December judgment for Kidd v. Pappas suggests that counties could be on the hook to pay the surplus equity owed to property owners. Experts say the tax auction is the best play for Cook County to “protect themselves against future liability,” according to Matt Kriese, general counsel for the Center for Community Progress, a national nonprofit that helps restore vacant and abandoned properties to productive use in communities. However, Kriese said that the county should “have a robust series of tools to be able to keep [property owners] out of [the tax sale] pipeline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that somebody could lose their home because they’re unable to pay their property taxes is a terrible outcome that we want to do everything in our power, I think, to prevent,” Kriese added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the legislation makes its way to the floor, there is still the issue of this spring’s anticipated tax sale. Last year, when Springfield legislators filed proposals to make the state’s tax sale system compliant with the Supreme Court ruling, they also postponed last year’s tax sale until March 2026. However, even if the legislature swiftly passes this bill, the county's tax offices and courts will need time to implement the new rules, according to Kirvan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirvan’s position is that the March 2026 tax sale must be postponed. “We are doing all we can to persuade the General Assembly to amend the statute that currently requires the sale to be held in March,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the bill will address some immediate needs, the road to reform continues. On Feb. 25, the Supreme Court will hear another case about a central Michigan property that was sold in a foreclosure auction due to delinquent property taxes. In Peng v. Isabella County, the plaintiffs argue that the surplus equity they received after the auction sale was less than the equity they were due based on the value of the home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Kirvan said, “our read of that is that in the foreclosure context, the winning bid at an auction like this is a court-sanctioned way of determining the fair market value of the property again within the foreclosure context.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/12/10/cook-county-homeowners-property-tax-sales-foreclosures-illegal-federal-judge\"   &gt;Property tax foreclosures illegally stripped Cook County homeowners of their equity, federal judge rules&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/05/16/tax-foreclosures-illinois-home-ownership-velma-lewis-cook-county\"   &gt;Illinois is the last state still unlawfully stripping wealth from homeowners in tax foreclosures&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/11/17/cook-county-property-taxes-analysis-treasurer-maria-pappas-downtown-south-west-sides\"   &gt;Black neighborhoods hit hardest with Cook County property tax bill increase, analysis finds&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/06/06/property-tax-foreclosure-reform-illinois-legislature-maria-pappas\"   &gt;Property tax foreclosure reform is put off by Illinois legislators&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Every business has disgruntled employees that don't like being terminated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with the Obama Presidential Center set to open in June just a mile east of the museum, Irmer wants the DuSable to be a part of the influx of visitors to the neighborhood. “That's another reason why it's so important for us to present a modernized, well-maintained face for all of the visitors that are going to be coming from around the world,” Irmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-270000\" name=\"image-270000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c1bda92/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2F75%2F9c431d034b089e3a295013bdc0ea%2Fjuneteenth-062025-07.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e7bd053/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2F75%2F9c431d034b089e3a295013bdc0ea%2Fjuneteenth-062025-07.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ea68069/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2F75%2F9c431d034b089e3a295013bdc0ea%2Fjuneteenth-062025-07.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Perri Irmer, president and CEO of DuSable Black History Museum, stands inside the DuSable Black History Museum during a Juneteenth celebration in 2025. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ea68069/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2F75%2F9c431d034b089e3a295013bdc0ea%2Fjuneteenth-062025-07.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fa28200/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2F75%2F9c431d034b089e3a295013bdc0ea%2Fjuneteenth-062025-07.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ea68069/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff6%2F75%2F9c431d034b089e3a295013bdc0ea%2Fjuneteenth-062025-07.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perri Irmer, president and CEO of DuSable Black History Museum, stands inside the DuSable Black History Museum during a Juneteenth celebration in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zubaer Khan/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuSable’s renovated theater will feature reupholstered seats, new carpets and subflooring and paint, with capacity for up to 450 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, the museum opened a new exhibition, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/art/2025/11/22/dusable-museum-paris-in-black\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;“Paris In Black,”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Sources close to the DuSable Museum’s Board of Trustees told a reporter there is a lot of confusion about the museum’s accreditation status and collections care, some incorrectly believing that the institution has been accredited all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked at the check presentation ceremony about Dulaney’s lawsuit, Mendoza said: “I don't know any facts about it, really zero.

In December, the park district, which is the museum’s landlord, said in a statement that it forwarded Dulaney’s complaint to its Office of Inspector General, which is currently conducting its investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expect that our cultural partners will abide by all applicable laws and best practices,” the park district’s statement read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OIG’s office declined to provide further comment, and there is no timeline for the investigation’s completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the first hearing in Dulaney’s case, held last week at the Circuit Court of Cook County building, lawyers for the DuSable Museum said an internal investigation into the matter was underway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the DuSable Black History Museum and Education opened in 1961, it put Chicago on the map as home to the nation’s first independent museum of Black history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago’s DuSable Black History Museum and Education Center was founded in 1961 by six co-founders, including Dr. Margaret T. Burroughs, who was known as a powerhouse artist and educator who had an outsized influence on Chicago’s South Side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea for the museum was born in the living room of Burroughs’ Bronzeville mansion, which she shared with her husband, Charles. Together, they started the Ebony Museum of Negro History because they were worried about the erasure of Black history in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those close to her said she was a champion of the community and often welcomed homeless Black artists and creatives into her mansion with open arms. Dr. Burroughs died in 2010 at 95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the DuSable Museum holds more than 15,000 pieces of art and artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;",

It was the look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boxy, pink and orange robot felt more playful than mechanical, Harris said. Even “kind of cute.” It was one of a fleet of robots belonging to Coco Robotics, a Los Angeles-based sidewalk delivery company, that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/technology/2025/01/14/coco-delivery-robot-chicago\"   &gt;began appearing in some Chicago neighborhoods in late 2024. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But things changed for her when robot operations began to ramp up in Lincoln Park, she said. A mother of two, Harris is responsible for a stroller, a labradoodle and a young kid on a bike when she goes out for walks. More robots on her neighborhood's narrow sidewalks mean she has to be even more aware to ensure their safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The more time that I spent with them, and the more close contact I had with them...the more I began to kind of sour on them and having them in the neighborhood,\" Harris, 42, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris isn't alone in her sentiment. Josh Robertson, one of Harris' neighbors, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://nosidewalkbots.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;started a petition&lt;/a&gt; last summer to call on the city to pause the sidewalk robot program until they release safety findings on the devices and set rules for how they're deployed. The petition has received over 3,400 signatures from more than 50 ZIP codes across the city. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Sidewalks are for people, and should remain people-first,\" Robertson, 40, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As companies push to dispatch more of the delivery robots across neighborhoods in Chicago, Robertson said he hopes his petition will place pressure on city officials to pause the services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's an overview of the current state of robot delivery in the city — and how Chicagoans are responding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What companies are behind Chicago’s delivery robots?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coco Robotics and Serve Robotics are the two tech companies that have rolled out delivery robots across the city in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coco's robots began appearing in the 27th and 34th wards as part of its initial pilot program. Serve Robotics, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/business/2025/09/29/look-out-coco-the-food-delivery-robots-introduced-in-late-2024-now-have-competition\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;another Los Angeles-based sidewalk robotics company&lt;/a&gt;, launched 50 robots across much of the city's North and West sides last September, adding to the growing fleet of robotic delivery couriers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The robots were first allowed by the city in 2022, when then-Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced that the City Council had approved of a Personal Delivery Device (PDD) pilot program. This program allowed for local food establishments to partner with the companies to use their small robots to deliver food to their customers. Throughout the launch of the program, the Chicago Department of Transportation carried out an assessment of the robots to see if they can be used safely without inconveniencing sidewalk users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is still ongoing and will not renew past May 2027 without action from the City Council, according to the city's website. In December, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://311.chicago.gov/s/article/Personal-Delivery-Devices-PDD?language=en_US\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;the city released a 311 category&lt;/a&gt; to encourage Chicago residents to submit their concerns and feedback about the robots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where in the city can you run into a delivery robot?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are currently 100 delivery robots up and running in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coco's 50 robots operate in Fulton Market, the West Loop, River West, the Loop, South Loop and Greektown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serve's 50 robots operate in 14 neighborhoods: Austin, Belmont Cragin, Dunning, East Garfield Park, Humboldt Park, Lake View, Lincoln Park, Little Italy, Logan Square, Near North Side, Near West Side, Uptown, West Garfield Park and West Town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, neither company's robots operate on the city's South side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do they deliver anything other than food?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Serve and Coco have partnerships with Uber Eats for food and restaurant deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coco robots also supports delivery for certain grocery and everyday essentials through its partnership with DoorDash and DashMart, according to a representative for Coco robots. Serve's director of government affairs, Yariel Diaz, said the company hopes to expand \"beyond food delivery to groceries, medications, parcels and more.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers in the neighborhoods where robot delivery is available are able to choose their preferred delivery method when placing an order in their app of choice. Users can also opt out of robot delivery entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do they accept tips?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. Robots don't accept tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can the robots deal with snow and ice?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies say their robots are equipped to operate in winter conditions, but &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/NGIR5it1gSE\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;one city resident documented&lt;/a&gt; a robot getting stuck in the snow this winter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-520000\" name=\"image-520000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee9d680/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4256x2389+0+224/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F22%2F13%2F685ea1e941eb816bb16eb28eb4b8%2Fdh1-2469-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2881094/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4256x2389+0+224/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F22%2F13%2F685ea1e941eb816bb16eb28eb4b8%2Fdh1-2469-2.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f8173ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4256x2389+0+224/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F22%2F13%2F685ea1e941eb816bb16eb28eb4b8%2Fdh1-2469-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"DH1_2469-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f8173ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4256x2389+0+224/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F22%2F13%2F685ea1e941eb816bb16eb28eb4b8%2Fdh1-2469-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a2df73/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4256x2389+0+224/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F22%2F13%2F685ea1e941eb816bb16eb28eb4b8%2Fdh1-2469-2.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f8173ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4256x2389+0+224/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F22%2F13%2F685ea1e941eb816bb16eb28eb4b8%2Fdh1-2469-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Serve Robotics food delivery robot goes on a test run downtown earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How have residents and alderpersons responded to the robots?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several alderpersons across the city have begun surveying their residents to gauge interest in expanding robot services into their neighborhoods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alderman Bennett Lawson (44th) and Alderwoman Angela Clay (46th) sent out surveys to their respective constituents in November. Alderman Daniel La Spata (1st) hosted a virtual meeting with representatives from both robot companies and constituents on Feb. 2 to provide residents in his ward with an opportunity to ask questions and share concerns. In addition to the meeting, his offices also collected feedback. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement released Tuesday, his office said that robot deliveries will not be expanding further in the ward after 83.7% of 1st Ward respondents strongly disagreed with the expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"While I will not be asking Coco to pull back from their limited pilot area east of Wood Street, neither company will be expanding further into the ward,\" he said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since starting his petition, Robertson said he's added an optional incident field where people can leave their experiences with the robots. He said he has seen around 850 incident reports on his form, as individuals reported incidents of collisions, injuries and obstruction of sidewalks around their neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"These robots have had a real tangible effect for Chicagoans going about their lives at street and sidewalk levels,\" Robertson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What do delivery drivers and couriers think?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efrain Berrocal, a courier and dispatch coordinator at Chicago-based Cut Cats, a courier service run by cyclists, said the robots may pose a threat to traditional courier services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We haven't seen it be an issue so far, but I could see it becoming an issue when, inevitably, restaurants start to use more 3rd party apps, and then those 3rd party apps start to get their own robots,\" he said. \"Then...we might see an issue.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To combat this, the 12-year-old business that has worked with over 85 restaurants and businesses in the city, continues to market itself as a local group, where humans are part of the entire process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But both Coco and Serve argue that the robots are a boon both for businesses and human couriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, a Coco representative said that Chicago is well suited for short-distance deliveries because of the city's density and walkability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"For restaurants and retailers, robots help make last-mile delivery more efficient by reducing congestion, lowering delivery costs, and smoothing peak demand, especially during busy meal times,\" the representative said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Serve's website, when the robots focus on short-distance delivery, \"human couriers are able to focus on higher-value deliveries and restaurants can stay focused on cooking and in-store guests.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The website also says that servicing the robot operations also creates new roles in remote assistance, fleet operations and maintenance. \"Robots act as a supplemental tool alongside human workers, not a replacement,\" the website said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Which is faster — a robot or a human?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for Coco robots said: \"Robot delivery isn't designed to compete on raw speed. The bigger goal is easing congestion in cities by taking short car trips off the road. Coco robots move at pedestrian pace, up to about 5 mph, and intentionally slow down around people or obstacles. The focus is efficiency, not rushing, helping complete short delivery trips in a predictable, low-impact way while reducing traffic and emissions,\" in a statement sent via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Serve robots website, their average delivery time is about 18 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;",

CEO Tony Hernandez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project, at 1237 N. California Ave. across from Humboldt Park, is the second development the Hispanic Housing Development Corp. has recently opened in the West Side. The Pedro Albizu Campos Apartments, 1203 N. California Ave., opened in May 2024 with 64 affordable apartments. There's currently a waitlist for three-bedroom units at the Pedro Albizu Campos, according to the Hispanic Housing Development’s website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hernandez said the two projects — with more to come — represent “a bulwark against the forces of gentrification that are displacing families from the community.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developer purchased the site at 1237 N. California from the Puerto Rican Parade Committee in 2019 for just over $1 million, property records show. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous building “had fallen into disrepair,” Hernandez said, leading the company to respond to community calls to purchase and redevelop the site. Demolition took place soon after, and project partners broke ground on the cleared land in July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-550000\" name=\"image-550000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64e7d6f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5431x3048+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2F58%2F04094dae4d2b894b8d644bb84c96%2Fhumboldthouse-260212-12.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0745c79/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5431x3048+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2F58%2F04094dae4d2b894b8d644bb84c96%2Fhumboldthouse-260212-12.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a49d8d2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5431x3048+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fff%2F58%2F04094dae4d2b894b8d644bb84c96%2Fhumboldthouse-260212-12.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Hispanic Housing Development Corp.

And 18 units are eligible for housing voucher recipients, supported by the Chicago Housing Authority. The property also has a community room, indoor bicycle storage and laundry facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The larger apartments follow community calls for more family-sized units in the neighborhood, as westward development spreading to Humboldt Park raises rents and pushes long-time families out of the area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monthly rents at the new building range from $900 to $1,800, according to the project team. A two-bedroom apartment rents between $1,120 to $1,450.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building is already fully leased — a sign of strong demand for affordable apartments in the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f40000\" name=\"image-f40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1443d70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+519/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fea%2F1c%2F2276f3854e659960803613b9c78b%2Fhumboldthouse-260212-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/93e45d8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+519/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fea%2F1c%2F2276f3854e659960803613b9c78b%2Fhumboldthouse-260212-1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/81d33ca/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+519/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fea%2F1c%2F2276f3854e659960803613b9c78b%2Fhumboldthouse-260212-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"View of Humboldt Park from inside a two-bedroom apartment at 1237 N.

Jessie Fuentes (26th) said during the project's ribbon cutting ceremony. “When we think about projects like this, we dream of a community where neighborhoods don't have to say goodbye to their childhood memories, or where children don't have to grow up in a neighborhood that their parents do not have ties in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of all Humboldt Park renters experience housing cost burdens, according to Heather Spray, who manages multifamily development for the Illinois Housing Development Authority. Nearly a third of residents spend more than half of their income on rent. Experts say renters should typically spend about one-third of their monthly income on rent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On a personal level, this means that residents may be forced to sacrifice money for food, health care and other necessities to keep their housing. On a community level, long-time residents move out of the area,” Spray said. “We want to prevent both from happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Chicago provided the bulk of the funding for the $32 million project, with a grant from IHDA helping to bridge the remaining funding gap. Merchants Capital, Freddie Mac and ComEd also supported the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jose Lopez, executive director of the Puerto Rican Cultural Center, said the building's design is significant — something that can often be overlooked in affordable housing. The coquí, a frog native to Puerto Rico, is featured in the building's artwork. A coquí pin was also worn by project partners during the ribbon cutting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's a very small toad that makes an amazingly beautiful song at night,” Lopez said. “For Puerto Ricans, it’s a very beloved, beloved symbol of who we are. Human beings are aesthetics and creative beings. And for us, where we live should reflect that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hispanic Housing Development has \"big plans\" for the future of the Northwest Side, Hernandez said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developer broke ground in January on the redevelopment of the historic &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/07/14/humboldt-park-historic-pioneer-arcade-redeveloped-affordable-senior-housing\"   &gt;Pioneer Arcade building&lt;/a&gt; in Humboldt Park, which will be converted into 61 affordable senior housing units. The developer is also partnering with the Puerto Rican Cultural Center to develop two affordable housing buildings near Division Street and Western Avenue. One of the buildings will be senior housing, while the other targets families. &lt;/p&gt;",

education&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;As President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign surged in Chicago last fall, Chicago Public Schools officials fielded an influx of calls for support from schools due to immigration enforcement activity near their buildings, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The impact&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;The presence of federal agents forced students inside during recess and after-school activities, disrupted learning, and at times created chaos. Students, both those from immigrant families and their peers, say the heightened environment left them looking over their shoulders and unable to concentrate, frequently glancing at classroom doors or worrying about family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CPS' role&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;It also placed an unprecedented burden on school principals and district officials, who had to ensure timely communication with families without sowing fear or spreading rumors. Community members say coordination with CPS was difficult at first and eventually improved, but the district still faces a big challenge if widespread enforcement returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key quote&lt;/b&gt;: Educators say they've tried not to let the situation affect their classrooms, but it's difficult to ignore. \"Every time we would look at the Bill of Rights, there was a question mark, saying, 'Well, but do I really have these rights?'\" said Mary Urban, a special education teacher in Humboldt Park. \"There was this sense of sadness, of trauma, but also injustice because young people understand what’s happening in the world around them.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"

Seidel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;'Big time' support&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Charles Exum, the U.S. Border Patrol agent who shot and wounded Chicago’s Marimar Martinez, once wrote that his superiors had been supportive of him \"big time.\" Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino praised him after the shooting. Support continued up the chain, Exum said, from U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to someone known as \"El Jefe himself\" — who might be President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pointing to evidence&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Martinez and her attorneys say newly released evidence shows Exum lied to justify the shooting. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said Wednesday that Exum \"was placed on administrative leave.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key context&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;While incremental, the notable development comes after a weekslong campaign by Martinez, who was shot five times Oct. 4 on the Southwest Side.

Customers just say \"10,\" \"six,\" \"12,\" and there’s no need for explanation. Although the unassuming place, located in a strip mall, serves a variety of savory dishes, the namesake pączki are the star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poles in Chicago and in Poland eat pączki throughout the year, with many bakeries, delis and supermarkets offering a variety of fillings and glazes. But the real celebration is on Tłusty Czwartek (Fat Thursday), which precedes America’s Pączki Day (Fat Tuesday), and is traditionally a time to consume all fats and sugar before Lent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Polish Pączki Cafe, 7210 W. Foster Ave., every now and then a customer unfamiliar with the classic Polish delicacy walks in, lured by the activity inside and the boxes others carry out. If co-owner Anna Niziołek is around, she will educate newcomers on the pronunciation (\"two PAWNCH-key but one PAWN-chek\"), the origins and the process of making pączki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She will gently correct those who call her pączki \"doughnuts\" and is quick to explain that they don’t sell them with custard, chocolate or other fillings. The original filling — a mix of plum, rose and raspberry marmalades imported from Poland — is hand-folded into the dough before frying, rather than injected afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Our pączki are special because we make them fresh every day from scratch by hand, using a very old Polish recipe,\" Niziołek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wykdtyd-l-ty/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;YOUR DAILY QUESTION ☕️&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What's the best way to spend Valentine's Day in Chicago if you're single?&amp;nbsp;❤️&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:newsletters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Email us&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; with your answer (please include your first and last name).

The painting shows a Biblical scene, unusual for a woman at this time, and unusual in showing the strength and determination of Judith and her maid.

We want the best possible work we can get.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She believes its latest acquisitions fit that bill. Not only do the works significantly boost the overall size of the museum’s collection, they deepen its holdings of artists of color, particularly those by women, such as Alabama-born Brenda Davis. The Intuit’s collection now numbers about 1,500 objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlights among the 61 works include “Untitled (Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary)” (ca. 1970s), the museum’s first work by Sam Doyle (1906-85), an artist from the island of St. Helena off the coast of South Carolina. Another is a painting of Wrigley Field by William Hawkins (1895-1990), a renowned outsider artist from Columbus, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"  data-align-hangRight&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-200000\" name=\"image-200000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed6f90a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1578x886+0+757/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F01%2F51%2Fb2d76fa2424ab9c833b4c909b202%2F2025-69-high-res.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cb65732/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1578x886+0+757/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F01%2F51%2Fb2d76fa2424ab9c833b4c909b202%2F2025-69-high-res.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cedcd4c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1578x886+0+757/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F01%2F51%2Fb2d76fa2424ab9c833b4c909b202%2F2025-69-high-res.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"2025.69 High-res.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cedcd4c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1578x886+0+757/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F01%2F51%2Fb2d76fa2424ab9c833b4c909b202%2F2025-69-high-res.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6aec88a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1578x886+0+757/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F01%2F51%2Fb2d76fa2424ab9c833b4c909b202%2F2025-69-high-res.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cedcd4c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1578x886+0+757/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F01%2F51%2Fb2d76fa2424ab9c833b4c909b202%2F2025-69-high-res.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope Atkinson (American, 1946-2012).Don’t Look Back This Way To A New Life, 2000.

Driehaus, has mostly housed decorative arts from the late 19th and early 20th-century. Displays have revolved around such famed artists and workshops as Louis Comfort Tiffany and the Wiener Werkstätte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driehaus’ executive director, Lisa M. Key, said this latest round of acquisitions is a big step in fulfilling the museum’s desire to bolster its holdings of paintings, drawings and original prints. “Through working with these donors,” she said, “we’ve been able to exponentially grow the [fine art] works in our collection not only in a scale but also in a quality that we would never have been able to afford if we were to be purchasing them outright.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five paintings from the Schwartz collection include examples by late 19th- and early 20th-century women artists Pauline Dohn and Lucie Hartrath as well as William Clusmann’s “Untitled (Chicago Street Scene)” (ca. 1920s).

That Obama-era policy determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin will “formalize the rescission of the 2009 Obama-era endangerment finding\" at a White House ceremony, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The action \"will be the largest deregulatory action in American history, and it will save the American people $1.3 trillion in crushing regulations,” she said. The bulk of the savings will stem from reduced costs for new vehicles, with the EPA projecting average per vehicle savings of more than $2,400 for popular light-duty cars, SUVs and trucks, Leavitt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The endangerment finding is the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/epa-endangerment-finding-zeldin-trump-climate-change-4b34246d5ca798154af08560fd94f7b9\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;legal underpinning of nearly all climate regulations&lt;/a&gt; under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet. It is used to justify regulations, such as auto emissions standards, intended to protect against threats made increasingly severe by climate change — deadly floods, extreme heat waves, catastrophic wildfires and other natural disasters in the United States and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Legal challenges certain to come&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal challenges are certain for any action that effectively would repeal those regulations, with environmental groups describing the shift as the single biggest attack in U.S. history on federal efforts to address climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Trump administration is abandoning its core responsibility to keep us safe from extreme weather and accelerating climate change,'' said Abigail Dillen, president of the nonprofit law firm Earthjustice. “There is no way to reconcile EPA’s decision with the law, the science and the reality of disasters that are hitting us harder every year. Earthjustice and our partners will see the Trump administration in court.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch said the Obama-era rule was “one of the most damaging decisions in modern history” and said EPA “is actively working to deliver a historic action for the American people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, who has called climate change a “hoax,” previously issued &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;an executive order&lt;/a&gt; that directed EPA to submit a report on “the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding. Conservatives and some congressional Republicans have long sought to undo what they consider overly restrictive and economically damaging rules to limit greenhouse gases that cause global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who was tapped by Trump to lead EPA last year, has criticized his predecessors in Democratic administrations, saying they were &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-climate-epa-endangerment-zeldin-5cba0871c880e23d044ef40a398c57b2\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“willing to bankrupt the country”&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to combat climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats “created this endangerment finding and then they are able to put all these regulations on vehicles, on airplanes, on stationary sources, to basically regulate out of existence ... segments of our economy,\" Zeldin said in announcing the proposed rule last July. ”And it cost Americans a lot of money.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Zalzal, a lawyer and associate vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, countered that the EPA will be encouraging more climate pollution, higher health insurance and fuel costs and thousands of avoidable premature deaths. The EPA is focusing solely on industry costs while ignoring the rule's climate and health benefits, he and other advocates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeldin’s push “is cynical and deeply damaging, given the mountain of scientific evidence supporting the finding, the devastating climate harms Americans are experiencing right now and EPA’s clear obligation to protect Americans’ health and welfare,” Zalzal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Supreme Court has upheld endangerment finding&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court ruled in a 2007 case that planet-warming greenhouse gases, caused by burning of oil and other fossil fuels, are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the high court’s decision, in a case known as &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fu7061146.ct.sendgrid.net%2Fls%2Fclick%3Fupn%3Du001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC71V1zGV8xrgOOTNp90uc4hK9Q4LUXTGp-2FIwt04bUqVZwk1e2zS3tEArmKJLmuUkMSqEZ7inm-2BLkfYa-2BGLag8JuDMJ-2BkOUDhbLFPVn8MwbZ3ZAvhHROkUqEnaxSJ2GBko9996pZbkeU51PYG0DMfEA0FeKj74IN-2BweVF-2Fpy6bRlCS-2BMEpXVFzRIY8B6DB3MR619cmsyrshzXBiu-2B9BiqtBXMtsEi35YchKCuJALMO-2FRJu3AZJDq6FKIVsmqT9C4L6DSTyC0RGJhVD7-2Fpdad7rxJ0hzk87kg1hlbhuRXgzY-2Be7hQI1V6ExyRXx9y7t4gezNnLBqwmolhZhR3Vo2OpQ8YLFbQkyC-2B1WT02-2BPYFeKFHLRRgkIp2kNpiOjIqhgbYsAcRQCW5gbzGhgwuzyDf3HQA1f2Af8zWcgmcU1v03W6WEq4XWAysabeDYTffNHVlszTktd7Fb-2B3q4MJBIYvtIpujkHdocoZ1VCXxy8Zhb1nuWoh1M-2Br3LDqkN1eJAeQhkQqX2-2BDkVMxhX8lre5RugbZMia4yQBsFGQfhE6B0vEJci-2FEm5EyQQPhe8YyngDgREIUs3U8A1dzmQ1OBFjqBNi4-3D8nRS_SuYt8EWzCBCFJXOrlhZQt2TfY9BcyxUsWHxLNY-2BPnLxe9UooS0LV3GPam-2Fqk9k7r9QtMPZP5rgsaL-2F5Sq16ntOSmHN5oL4DBnx815JsXD-2B7Q4GYFW671UXZwvMicX6-2Bpj73yejLLv1MUjAVCWHl4wOvW4qYHh10aCkMavBkkS-2FXu5faHD-2Ffr9yP-2FaKAHc-2BTZwiCQE75m0iy9-2FhSpELN-2FlYPg-2BCi9DVYMAM8XBbFbp-2Bd-2FiiA4xuHbdq9s9TrGJGU84lPyxqrR51aY2PNk6z8hsjAw7tcfk2FFXj50VbXWxV7tQMHjWVExOfIX7nBop89CVT0Sm2X-2FC2bwM9cyoxd4hg-3D-3D&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmdaly%40ap.org%7C870ca7a9f2ac46c6743008de544775f4%7Ce442e1abfd6b4ba3abf3b020eb50df37%7C1%7C0%7C639040863129566468%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=d2CaiNr%2B91GKqUXKVWVuYYMj5cPY6%2F2yuBAlk7e05hc%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Massachusetts v.

Keen-eared Sox observers took note and then found three other instances of the GM making the same mistaken claim during the offseason, including at SoxFest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So I probably have been getting carried away describing his versatility,” Getz joked through a spokesman Thursday. “He can play every position on the field. Why does it have to stop there?

Sox position players are scheduled to report Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getz acquired him from the Mets last month along with right-hander Truman Pauley in exchange for Robert, the Sox GM’s last big trade chip as they look to turn a corner in their long slog of a rebuild. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acuña, who batted .234/.293/.274 with in 95 games for the Mets last year mostly played at second base, is expected to open the season in center field for the Sox, “but we're not closing the door on the infield either,” Getz said this week.&lt;/p&gt;",

It has a lot of value in Chicago. It was here before” Uber and Lyft, Business Affairs and Consumer Protection Commissioner Ivan Capifali told the Sun-Times. “We want to make sure that they survive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capifali essentially urged the City Council to approve the cab fare hike that Mayor Brandon Johnson introduced without fanfare in late September while public attention was focused on the battle over his 2026 budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mayor’s plan would maintain the cost of entering a cab, known as the “flag pull” at $3.25 for the first one-ninth of a mile, but provide substantial relief for cab drivers in other ways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include a $2.50 rush hour fee for rides between 3:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., a $1 overnight fee for rides between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m and increased charges for both time and distance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of 25 cents for each additional one-ninth mile, passengers would pay 31 cents. Another 25 cents would be tacked onto the fare for every 36 seconds instead of 20 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ordinance has languished in committee for months, but Capifali said that needs to change to accommodate the \"high cost of everything,\" including fuel, insurance and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They haven’t seen any fare increase in a while and that has led to other problems… We have received complaints from consumers that some taxi drivers are requesting a flat fee. That sometimes feels like they’re getting gouged. We have to make sure that doesn’t happen. Increasing the cab fare could be a solution to that,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Moberg, president of Checker, Yellow and American United Cab, said the pending increase is long overdue. Chicago cab drivers got some relief in 2022 when then-Mayor Lori Lightfoot imposed a temporary fuel surcharge. But it was only in place for about a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rideshare hurt us. But COVID was almost like the nail in the coffin. We have almost no business in the downtown or North Shore anymore,” Moberg said. “Insurance has gone up every year for the last several years. That’s our biggest expense. The industry needs a raise to stay competitive and stay available. It’s been a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago’s once-thriving taxi cab industry has been shrinking ever since the unregulated advent of ride-hailing services like Lyft and Uber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took years before the city finally stepped in and regulated that industry. By that time, the value of taxi cab medallions already had plummeted. &lt;br&gt;A medallion that once sold for as much as  $400,000 is now valued at $5,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pool of available drivers also is shrinking — and aging.  Anyone who  got laid off or needs to supplement their income can “go to Uber and be driving tomorrow,\" while it takes two or three weeks of classes to be cleared to drive a cab, Moberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have new blood with younger people coming in. It’s the same people who have been there for years and they’re slowly retiring and dying off. That’s probably our biggest handicap,\" Moberg said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the taxi industry got what advocates then called a “death blow.\" That’s when the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a federal appeals court ruling that snuffed out an attempt by the cab companies to level what they called an uneven playing field that favored Uber, whose investors included then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeals court ruling essentially said the business models of taxis and ride-hailing services are different and, therefore, they can continue to operate under different sets of rules in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That decision validated a 2014 city ordinance letting Uber and Lyft operate without taxi medallions, city-regulated fares, driver fingerprinting or other regulations cab companies and their drivers must follow. Uber and Lyft had long maintained that a background check based on FBI fingerprinting would discriminate against minorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2016, a divided City Council agreed to license ride-hailing drivers but opted not to require fingerprinting after Uber and Lyft threatened to abandon the Chicago market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Moberg renewed his appeal for \"the same regulations for both\" the taxicab and rideshare industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their cars don’t have to be inspected. Ours do. They can go to any gas station and get a certificate. Our cars have to go to inspection lanes two or three times a year,” Moberg said. “Is the public safer in a rideshare car? Same thing with drivers.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-4c0000\" name=\"html-embed-module-4c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe allow=\"monetization\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://play.prx.org/e?ge=prx_12963_8c00227b-d907-4999-8cf3-431b53c1af58&amp;uf=https%3A%2F%2Fpublicfeeds.net%2Ff%2F12963%2Ffeed-rss.xml\" style=\"min-width: 300px;\" width=\"100%\"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

A ladder he is not even close to finishing climbing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything is exciting for me still,” Buzelis said of his trip to Los Angeles for All-Star Weekend. “Anything you get to participate in is an honor and exciting, but I’m not going to lie, yeah, I want to be in that Sunday game for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/11/bears-caleb-williams-to-participate-in-celebrity-3-point-contest\"   &gt;Bears’ Caleb Williams to participate in celebrity 3-point contest during NBA All-Star Weekend&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That’s because Sunday is the varsity game. That’s when the best of the best cap off the weekend with the NBA All-Star Game. The showcase event. That’s always been the end game for Buzelis since the Bulls selected him in the 2024 draft — winning and to be the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy to lay out as goals, but as Buzelis is finding out, it’s a journey that comes with bruises and disappointment. He’s been reminded of that in the last week alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gone from the locker room are a majority of the veteran players that helped raise him as a rookie last season and into the summer. Coby White, Nikola Vucevic, Ayo Dosunmu and Kevin Huerter all traded by last Thursday’s deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s why the Buzelis hype train has again slowed down, awaiting the next fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not like he’s been bad in the four games since the roster purge. There just haven’t been many takeover moments. Rookies like Cooper Flagg and Kon Knueppel have already had takeover moments this season. It’s Year 2 for Buzelis and while there are highlights and glimpses, those are more teases than trends. He is more than aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m fully capable of becoming a great player and this is just the process it is going to be for me,” Buzelis said. “But I know for a fact that every year I’m going to get better as a player. I know that will happen. I’m going to work extremely hard, push myself until exhaustion to become that player. I’m more worried about this team and as a collective group what can we achieve. I’m all up for the challenge of becoming whatever people say or believe — All-Star, yada, yada.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy to ask but difficult to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I’m concerned about is I totally understand on the stat sheet that assists are going to be a reflection of made baskets, and consistently before (these trades) happened we were a team that was 28-30-some assists per game, and we come out of the first half (against Boston on Wednesday) with eight assists,” coach Billy Donovan said when asked about concerns for Buzelis inconsistent play lately. “We need to learn how to play the right way, everybody. Whether it be Matas or Patrick (Williams), they’ve been here and they know how we have to play. Nobody is going to look good when you’re not helping each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another gut-punch that Buzelis is trying to deal with? Winning is his top priority and it is sinking in that his franchise is in the midst of a soft tank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is hard but what can you do? You’re not going home and crying about it,” Buzelis said of the team and where it is in the standings. “You’ve just got to wake up and get back to work. I do understand that it’s going to be difficult to get into a groove as a team, but we’re all up for that challenge.

El mensaje decía: “2k en info cuando lo agarren,” “10k si lo derribas,” y “LK … sobre él”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bovino fue la cara del Operativo Midway Blitz, la agresiva campaña de deportación de la administración de Trump en el área de Chicago el año pasado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los fiscales en el caso penal no se propusieron probar la afiliación de Espinoza Martínez con los Latin Kings. Sin esa afirmación, la jueza del distrito Joan Lefkow &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2026/01/09/fiscales-ya-no-intentaran-comprobar-que-hombre-acusado-de-poner-recompensa-por-greg-bovino-era-pandillero\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;prohibió la evidencia relacionada con pandillas&lt;/a&gt; en su juicio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Espinoza Martínez ha estado en custodia federal durante más de cuatro meses desde su arresto por cargos de asesinato por encargo a principios de octubre, según muestran los registros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El jurado absolvió a Espinoza Martínez el 22 de enero después de un breve juicio en la Corte de Justicia Federal Dirksen. Fue &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2026/01/26/hombre-absuelto-del-complot-de-asesinato-de-gregory-bovino-es-detenido-por-ice\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;rápidamente llevado a la custodia&lt;/a&gt; del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los funcionarios del DHS han acusado a Espinoza Martínez de estar en el país ilegalmente.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sussethe Rentería, abogada de inmigración que representa a Espinoza Martínez, dijo que ingresó al país a los 5 años y que Chicago era “el único hogar que conoce”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rentería rechazó las afirmaciones de que Espinoza Martínez representara un peligro para la comunidad o un riesgo de fuga, diciendo que Seguridad Nacional estaba “intentos de revivir el caso criminal” a pesar de su absolución.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Destacó que Espinoza Martínez no tenía antecedentes penales aparte de infracciones menores de tránsito y negó que tuviera alguna implicación con una pandilla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Aunque respetamos la decisión de la corte, estamos decepcionados con el resultado”, dijo Rentería después de la audiencia. “Él cuenta con el apoyo inquebrantable de su comunidad y su familia, y tiene tres hijos y una esposa desesperada por que regrese a casa. Estamos seguros de que se hará justicia”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rentería comentó que estaba considerando apelar la decisión de la corte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Durante la audiencia, Rentería también presentó una declaración del concejal Michael Rodriguez (22°) que afirmaba que Espinoza Martínez, que vive en el vecindario de La Villita, “no tenía conexión con actividades de pandillas”. Enfatizó que simplemente vivir en un vecindario con presencia de pandillas no convierte a alguien en miembro de una pandilla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La semana pasada, un juez federal en Indiana &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2026/02/04/juez-federal-ordena-no-deportar-a-hombre-de-chicago-exonerado-del-complot-de-asesinato-de-bovino\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;bloqueó temporalmente&lt;/a&gt; a la administración de Trump de deportar a Espinoza Martínez, quien estaba detenido en el Centro de Justicia del Condado de Clay en Brazil, Indiana. Su abogado, Michael Adler, presentó una petición el 2 de febrero en el Distrito Sur de Indiana para impugnar su detención.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El juez ordenó a la administración de Trump que no moviera a Espinoza Martínez “fuera de la jurisdicción de los Estados Unidos”, o fuera del 7° Circuito —que incluye Illinois, Indiana y Wisconsin— mientras se avanza en el litigio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Se programó una audiencia de expulsión para el 25 de febrero. Rentería dijo que presentará una solicitud para cancelar la expulsión.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contribuyó: Jon Seidel\n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

State St. on her way to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Voting makes a difference in terms of how our society runs,” said Banks-Word, 47. “I think a lot of us are not aware of how important the primary and midterm elections are. Most people just vote for the presidency, and we see how that turned out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks-Word, of the South Loop, said she was voting to protect people’s rights across the country and wanted everyone to feel safe wherever they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything's at stake at this point,” she said. “We've seen how everything has been going downhill, how people are being harassed by different political groups and law enforcement agents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks-Word wasn’t the only one encouraged to vote because of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement campaign, which has sent hundreds of federal agents into cities across the country — including Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early December, the Department of Homeland Security said at least 4,400 people had been detained during Operation Midway Blitz, the Chicago area campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-2e0000\" name=\"image-2e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/14ccedc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6311x3542+0+333/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F08%2Fa5%2F73115c4047e3b005f0dee8849cef%2Fearlyvoting-260213-14.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c69008f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6311x3542+0+333/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F08%2Fa5%2F73115c4047e3b005f0dee8849cef%2Fearlyvoting-260213-14.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a3962d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6311x3542+0+333/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F08%2Fa5%2F73115c4047e3b005f0dee8849cef%2Fearlyvoting-260213-14.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"EARLYVOTING_260213_14.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a3962d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6311x3542+0+333/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F08%2Fa5%2F73115c4047e3b005f0dee8849cef%2Fearlyvoting-260213-14.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cd01b42/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6311x3542+0+333/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F08%2Fa5%2F73115c4047e3b005f0dee8849cef%2Fearlyvoting-260213-14.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a3962d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6311x3542+0+333/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F08%2Fa5%2F73115c4047e3b005f0dee8849cef%2Fearlyvoting-260213-14.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kamilah Banks-Word voted at a new supersite at the south end of the Loop Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erick El, of Uptown, hadn’t voted in years but felt it was time to do something to overturn elected officials who he said were “tearing America apart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to get Trump out of office,” said El, 54. “He's ripping families apart.

It’s a disingenuous question.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hernandez said all election judges know to call the board and 911 if they see any unusual activity near voting sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials also reminded voters casting ballots by mail to return them quickly after the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/04/usps-postmark-change-could-threaten-mail-in-voters-cook-county-officials-warn\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;U.S. Postal Service announced&lt;/a&gt; that it could not guarantee ballots would be postmarked before Election Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new policy, mail will be postmarked, then date-stamped, on the day it is processed at the post office, rather than the day it is dropped in a mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because mail is often processed days after it is dropped off, if ballots are postmarked after Election Day it could jeopardize whether votes are counted. Mail-in ballots must be postmarked by Election Day and received within 14 days to be counted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don't risk a late postmark on your ballot,” said Hernandez. “Your vote needs to be counted.”&lt;/p&gt;",

The amount parents take out in loans is sometimes more than their annual earnings, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fear is really that they're just putting these families into real financial trouble, real financial jeopardy,” Burd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report focuses on federal Parent PLUS loans, which parents can use to pay for tuition costs that can’t be covered out of pocket or through scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most federal student loans have limits, families can take out Parent PLUS loans up to the total cost of attendance. But Parent PLUS loans, which have a high fixed interest rate and origination fees, weren’t designed for low-income families, Burd said. They were meant to help middle- and upper-income families send their children to more prestigious and expensive schools, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were never intended as a way for schools to be able to help low-income students,” Burd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePaul officials say the university provides scholarships and grants and offers information about various loans and provides but ultimately families decide what to borrow. A Loyola University spokesperson said he wanted to review the study before commenting further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Parent PLUS loans, the schools are not held accountable if the borrowers go into default, and the Trump administration is expected to soon start garnishing wages from people who have defaulted on student loans after a pause on payments that started during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools can offer students merit-based scholarships based on grades and academic success, even if they don’t qualify for need-based aid. And those scholarships can end up taking up a large share of a school’s financial aid funds, leaving low-income students in need of loans — and that’s where the Parent PLUS loans come in, Burd says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem compounds, Burd says, when schools offer better financial aid packages to students whose families make more, a strategy he says is often aimed at attracting high-achieving and wealthy students who could give generous donations in the future. That incentivizes colleges to recruit students with an eye for “raising revenue for your institution and rising up the rankings,” Burd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some schools have used this practice to improve their spot in national rankings and transform themselves from a humble commuter school to a nationally competitive university, the report says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find schools that appeared to be steering lower-income families toward Parent PLUS loans, Burd looked for colleges where a large share of students who received federal Pell Grants, which are meant for low-income students, had parents taking out Parent PLUS loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At DePaul University, 53% of students whose parents took out Parent PLUS loans were Pell Grant recipients and their parents borrowed on average $33,000 in PLUS loans, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Loyola, 48% of students whose parents have Parent PLUS loans had Pell grants. The average Parent PLUS debt taken on by those Loyola parents was around $46,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-3f0000\" name=\"image-3f0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/32606e3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/05f5575/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c844ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Loyola University Chicago campus\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c844ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d797611/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c844ab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3771+0+354/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F80%2F68%2F198a9100482b85e1b0223019dd32%2Floyola-03312020-empty-university-campus-mm00001.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Loyola University Chicago, 48% of students whose parents have Parent PLUS loans received Pell grants for lower-income students.

The spokesperson said DePaul provides students over $350 million a year in academic scholarships and need-based grants using institutional funds and philanthropic gifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“DePaul offers information to students and families regarding various loan options, and ultimately families make the decision to proceed with loans as they see fit,” the spokesperson wrote in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 41 private and public colleges and universities cited in the report collectively spent $2.4 billion of their financial aid dollars on students who didn’t need the help in 2023, the most recent data available. Nearly $2 out of every $5 spent on financial aid went to students who the federal government considers able to afford college without additional aid, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burd started with a list of more than 300 selective colleges and universities with a certain size endowment, excluding historically Black colleges and universities because he said they have been historically underfunded and have far less financial aid to give. Art schools were also excluded because they are among the most expensive schools, partly because of costly supplies and tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burd then looked for schools at which families of Pell Grant recipients made up at least one-third of PLUS loan borrowers and the median amount of loans was at least $15,000. At the 41 schools cited in the report, 45% of the borrowers were the parents of Pell recipients, and they borrowed a median amount of $29,102.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some lawmakers have noted this trend and have capped Parent PLUS loans at $65,000 per child, but Burd says that’s still too much for many families to borrow. He said ideally, legislation will be implemented to stop schools from steering families toward taking out loans they can’t afford to repay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only other worry, though, is that private lenders are going to come in and start offering even more predatory products,” he said. “So that's something we need to look out for as well.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Operating income was $5.4 million, down 66% from $16 million, compared to the same quarter last year.

But the company has since scaled back its ambitious plans for a national expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, it lowered targets for new restaurant openings from 12 to eight for the fiscal year 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in 2024, hedge fund Engaged Capital took a 9.9% stake in Portillo’s to push for changes. The California-based activist fund said it aimed to “unlock the intrinsic value” of the company. That could include “optimizing restaurant performance, improving restaurant-level cash on cash returns, enhancing corporate governance (including through potential changes to the composition of the Board) and/or exploring a sale,” Engaged said in a securities filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, workers at a Portillo’s food production center in Addison voted to unionize and become members of the Iron Workers Union. The employees prepare and deliver food to the chain’s Chicago-area restaurants. They agitated for higher wages and safer conditions in 2021, a campaign that included a brief strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portillo’s was founded in 1963 by Dick Portillo in Villa Park and has grown from a small hot dog trailer to more than 90 restaurants across 10 states.&lt;/p&gt;",

Luego, lanzó un balón de fútbol americano pintado con las palabras en inglés “Together, we are America” (“Juntos somos América”)”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Académicos locales dicen que su mensaje era claro: el músico puertorriqueño estaba redefiniendo lo que significa ser “americano” más allá de solo los 50 estados de los Estados Unidos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“La mayoría de los estadounidenses, cuando hablamos de Estados Unidos, lo llamamos América como si Estados Unidos fuera la única nación que es América, pero para las personas en Latinoamérica y el Caribe, América se refiere a todo el hemisferio”, dijo Lilia Fernández, profesora de historia en la Universidad de Illinois en Chicago (UIC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fernández afirma que el mensaje unificador de Bad Bunny probablemente &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2026/02/09/la-alegria-llena-humboldt-park-durante-la-fiesta-de-medio-tiempo-del-benito-bowl\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;resonó con muchos en Chicago&lt;/a&gt; que son de los países o territorios que nombró o son descendientes de familiares que nacieron allí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-a30000\" name=\"html-embed-module-a30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27595327\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27595327/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Un análisis de WBEZ de datos del Censo de la encuesta comunitaria estadounidense más reciente estima que aproximadamente 1 de cada 8 habitantes de Chicago nació fuera de los 50 estados de Estados Unidos pero en uno de los países o territorios que conforman el hemisferio occidental, que abarca desde Sudamérica, Centroamérica y Norteamérica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;México es, con mucho, el lugar de origen más común para los habitantes de Chicago nacidos fuera de los 50 estados de Estados Unidos, seguido por Puerto Rico, Ecuador, Guatemala y Venezuela, en ese orden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Por supuesto, el número de habitantes de Chicago que se identifican como hijos o nietos de personas nacidas en esos lugares probablemente sea mucho mayor. El mensaje final de Bad Bunny se basa en una crítica centenaria a los Estados Unidos como la única “América”, dijo Mérida M. Rúa, profesora de estudios latinos y latinas en la Universidad Northwestern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rúa dice que artistas como el músico y político latino Rubén Blades, en su álbum de 1984 “Buscando América”, han señalado explícitamente la idea de América como un continente. Cientos de años antes que Blades, la visión panamericana de Simón Bolívar, quien lideró la lucha contra el dominio colonial español en Sudamérica, fue sostenida por eruditos como el poeta cubano José Martí en su ensayo de 1891 “Nuestra América”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aunque Bad Bunny es el más reciente de una larga línea de personas que han reformulado el significado de “América”, es el primero en hacerlo en un escenario tan grande como el espectáculo de medio tiempo del Super Bowl de la NFL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;También es una declaración poderosa para hacer en el actual entorno político, dijo Fernández. Justo el mes pasado, las fuerzas militares de Estados Unidos capturaron al presidente venezolano Nicolás Maduro. Mientras tanto, la administración de Trump continúa sus campañas de cumplimiento de la ley de inmigración en todo el país. El domingo, el presidente Donald Trump calificó el espectáculo de medio tiempo del Super Bowl como “absolutamente terrible” y “una ofensa a la Grandeza de Estados Unidos” en una publicación en la red social Truth Social. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parecía ser un mensaje de inclusión y una visión alternativa a las políticas que estamos viendo ahora mismo en los Estados Unidos, particularmente las que provienen de la Casa Blanca y los partidarios del presidente y sus políticas de cumplimiento”, aseguró Fernández.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

But the government has no legitimate interest in 'stopping private actors from speaking as they wish' to 'tilt public debate in a preferred direction,'\" the lawsuit reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosado started the page in January 2025 to keep individuals and small businesses informed about where U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was operating in Chicago, according to the lawsuit. The page was initially made up of fellow business owners and Rosado's friends and family. Group membership increased in September as ICE enforcement surged in the city and surrounding suburbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The page had almost 100,000 members by October, with thousands of posts and comments per day from members sharing information about violent encounters and arrests across the city, according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on Oct. 12, right-wing activist and Trump ally Laura Loomer &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1977345952718438707\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;tagged Noem and Bondi in a post&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the Facebook page and others like it \"are getting people killed.\" The next day, Loomer &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1977812771799461893?s=20\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;said in a post&lt;/a&gt; that a Department of Justice source told her that they had contacted executives at Meta, Facebook's parent company, \"to tell them they need to remove these ICE tracking pages from the platform.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noem and Bondi announced the removal of the Facebook page on their social media accounts on Oct. 14.  \"Anti-ICE radicals are using social media apps to dox, threaten, and terrorize the brave men and women of ICE and their families,\" Noem &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1978182132414448008?s=20\n\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;said in the post. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the suit, Rosado was notified by Facebook that the page was disabled because it \"went against the Community Standards multiple times.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the page was active, the suit said Facebook moderators had removed five posts in the group that were not created or approved by Rosado or her moderators. Additionally, the suit said Facebook had previously advised Rosado that \"it had only identified this handful of 'participant violations' of its rules, which 'don't hurt your group.'\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"By censoring our group, the government continues to erode our trust,\" Rosado said in a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.thefire.org/news/fire-sues-bondi-noem-censoring-facebook-group-and-app-reporting-ice-activity\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. \"They silenced not only my voice, but the voices of nearly 100,000 other community members.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosado filed the suit with Mark Hodges, an Indiana resident who created the app Eyes Up, which allowed users to record, securely store and view videos of ICE officers committing potential civil rights violations. According to the suit, Apple removed the app from the App Store in October, allegedly after pressure from the federal government and violating Hodges'  First Amendment-protected right to record law enforcement in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice, Apple and Meta did not respond immediately to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security's Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, \"ICE tracking apps put the lives of the men and women of law enforcement in danger as they go after terrorists, vicious gangs and violent criminal rings.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"But, of course, FIRE spins this correct decision for Apple to remove these apps as them caving to pressure instead of helping prevent further harm to federal officers,\" she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit asks the court to declare that Bondi and Noem's coercion of Facebook and Apple suppressed disfavored speech, which violates the First Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Plaintiffs bring this case to preserve our country's fundamental character as a free nation, asking this Court to protect the basic First Amendment right to share information about our government and its activities,\" the suit said.&lt;/p&gt;",

When the source play was written in a foreign language, “adapted by” usually means the translator has gone beyond just line-by-line conversion into English, but sometimes very little, sometimes a whole lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the amiable, elevated Goodman production of “Holiday,” though, we get something that seems extremely rare: a well-known title — produced four times previously by the Goodman and remembered fondly by screwball comedy buffs for the Cary Grant-Katharine Hepburn film version — that is truly, aggressively and yet still respectfully “adapted” from the Philip Barry 1928 original by Richard Greenberg.

Long-orphaned, up-from-nothing lawyer Johnny Case (Luigi Sottile) discovers that his new fiancée Julia Seton (Molly Griggs) comes from “those Setons,” an extremely wealthy old-money family living in a New York City mansion. A battle of values ensues: Johnny declares his intention to take a “holiday” from work after earning his first significant pile of cash, which an upcoming deal will accomplish. He wants to pursue happiness, even if he doesn’t yet know the details. Yes, he wants money, but not “too much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia is baffled, as is her high-expectation father Edward (Jordan Lage). But Julia’s siblings, freer-spirited older sister Linda (Bryce Gangel) and oft-intoxicated younger brother Ned (Wesley Taylor), take Johnny’s side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-460000\" name=\"image-460000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c60dfcc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6691x3755+652+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2F80%2F4a3e4879457d9042ae5e511e4fa7%2F1-holiday-production-photos.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3028b6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6691x3755+652+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2F80%2F4a3e4879457d9042ae5e511e4fa7%2F1-holiday-production-photos.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2dffd5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6691x3755+652+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2F80%2F4a3e4879457d9042ae5e511e4fa7%2F1-holiday-production-photos.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"1_Holiday Production Photos: (L-R) Molly Griggs, Wesley Taylor, Bryce Gangel, Luigi Sottile, Jordan Lage.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2dffd5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6691x3755+652+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2F80%2F4a3e4879457d9042ae5e511e4fa7%2F1-holiday-production-photos.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/07c56d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6691x3755+652+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2F80%2F4a3e4879457d9042ae5e511e4fa7%2F1-holiday-production-photos.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2dffd5e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6691x3755+652+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdc%2F80%2F4a3e4879457d9042ae5e511e4fa7%2F1-holiday-production-photos.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molly Griggs (from left), Wesley Taylor, Bryce Gangel, Luigi Sottile and Jordan Lage star in The Goodman’s “Holiday.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd Rosenberg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That synopsis applies to both the Barry and Greenberg versions. But this is far more than a straightforward updating to contemporary times, from just pre-Depression to just pre-pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dialogue is nearly all Greenberg’s. It has his rhythm, wit, edge, voice. If this does go to Broadway — there are aspirations — watch out for an intriguing debate about whether this qualifies as a revival or a new play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As directed by the Goodman’s former longtime leader Robert Falls, “Holiday” feels fresh, bereft of mothballs. Walt Spangler’s beautiful set design brings both the fully realized slickness of a quiet-luxury living room and the immersive, nostalgic dreaminess of a childhood playroom. The characters and the themes are familiar, but newly explored and enriched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f40000\" name=\"image-f40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9d4b31f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4125x2315+0+173/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2F16%2F4504ef71456da079a985ab8c0cfe%2F7-holiday-production-photos.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8dc9380/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4125x2315+0+173/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2F16%2F4504ef71456da079a985ab8c0cfe%2F7-holiday-production-photos.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/89088a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4125x2315+0+173/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2F16%2F4504ef71456da079a985ab8c0cfe%2F7-holiday-production-photos.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"7_Holiday Production Photos.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/89088a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4125x2315+0+173/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2F16%2F4504ef71456da079a985ab8c0cfe%2F7-holiday-production-photos.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de4232f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4125x2315+0+173/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2F16%2F4504ef71456da079a985ab8c0cfe%2F7-holiday-production-photos.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/89088a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4125x2315+0+173/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2F16%2F4504ef71456da079a985ab8c0cfe%2F7-holiday-production-photos.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryce Gangel and Wesley Taylor portray the born-rich Seton siblings in The Goodman’s “Holiday.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd Rosenberg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most compelling performances here come from the actors playing the born-rich Seton siblings, as Greenberg has fleshed them out so completely. After all, he was once labeled, in a New York Times headline, as the “bard of American privilege.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Griggs’ modern-day Julia has the compelling confidence of her father, who has invested in her wellness startup, but she also wonders whether she’s “an uncaring control freak.” (Her brother assures her she’s not uncaring.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Gangel’s deeply drawn depiction, Linda — who works with kids and has moved to Brooklyn — feels everyone’s wounds, especially her late mother’s, but her desire to “save” Julia from their father’s influence brings a response both fair and unfair at once: “What’s more privileged,” Julia asks her in an accusatory mode, “than being sad about being privileged?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ned is … well, right out of a Richard Greenberg play, and yet so much of him was there in Barry’s work too. Here he’s gay (which he probably was before but now it can be said) and Taylor delivers his emotional vulnerability with wit so droll that Ned comes across as so lovable and needy that Linda’s devotion to him — her co-dependence causes her to return to the house just to make sure he’s OK — feels utterly justifiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weakness in this new “Holiday” is that Johnny is perhaps too much just the same as he always was, but blander. His belief that hard work and accumulation of wealth are means and not ends remains as relevant as ever, but that point of view, while contrary, isn’t nearly as surprising. Maybe the character doesn’t require updating the way the women, or the addict, do, but at least in Sottile’s take, he now comes off as flat amid a group of siblings who are fully dimensional.&lt;/p&gt;",

Dijo que el apoyo continuó en la cadena de mando, desde la secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kristi Noem, hasta alguien conocido como “El [mismo] Jefe”, que se podría referir al presidente Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sin embargo, Martínez y sus abogados afirman que la &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2026/02/11/agentes-dijeron-es-hora-de-ser-agresivos-en-video-que-contradice-las-afirmaciones-contra-marimar-martinez\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;nueva evidencia publicada&lt;/a&gt; muestra que el agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza, Charles Exum, mintió para justificar el disparo. Y el miércoles, un portavoz de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP) dijo que Exum “fue puesto en licencia administrativa”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-820000\" name=\"module-820000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;El portavoz, que hizo el comentario en un correo electrónico al Chicago Sun-Times, no respondió a un correo de seguimiento preguntando cuándo comenzó el descanso, o si aún está en efecto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aunque es un desarrollo progresivo, es notable que ocurre tras una campaña de varias semanas por parte de Martínez, a quien Exum le disparó cinco veces el 4 de octubre en el lado suroeste de la ciudad. Martínez decidió hablar el mes pasado después de que agentes de inmigración en Minneapolis le dispararan fatalmente a Renee Macklin Good y Alex Pretti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"

retrasar la jubilación de Exum “más allá de los 57 años”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A la luz de tu excelente servicio en Chicago”, escribió Bovino, “¡aún tienes mucho por hacer!”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exum también testificó en noviembre que “nunca” había sido suspendido por la Patrulla Fronteriza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahora, el portavoz de CBP dice que “todos los incidentes significativos de uso de la fuerza son investigados, revisados y presentados a la Junta Nacional de Revisión del Uso de la Fuerza”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los fiscales federales en Chicago presentaron cargos de asalto contra Martínez tras su encuentro con Exum. &lt;a class=\"Link\"

para justificar el tiroteo. Indicaron un diagrama dibujado por un agente de la escena del tiroteo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El dibujo muestra tres vehículos delante de la Chevrolet Tahoe de Exum, además de la Nissan Rogue de Martínez y una GMC Envoy manejada por otro hombre que enfrentó cargos criminales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El video muestra que los tres autos representados frente a la Tahoe de Exum “no existen”, dijo el abogado Christopher Parente.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-99a4ef\" name=\"image-99a4ef\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/34846f1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/612x343+0+233/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2Fa8%2F27f031b440118f7f8b16ea811849%2Ffbimain-001-000034.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04a254a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/612x343+0+233/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2Fa8%2F27f031b440118f7f8b16ea811849%2Ffbimain-001-000034.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/20e46ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/612x343+0+233/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2Fa8%2F27f031b440118f7f8b16ea811849%2Ffbimain-001-000034.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"FBIMAIN_001-000034.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/20e46ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/612x343+0+233/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2Fa8%2F27f031b440118f7f8b16ea811849%2Ffbimain-001-000034.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c032e61/2147483647/strip/true/crop/612x343+0+233/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2Fa8%2F27f031b440118f7f8b16ea811849%2Ffbimain-001-000034.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/20e46ea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/612x343+0+233/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F83%2Fa8%2F27f031b440118f7f8b16ea811849%2Ffbimain-001-000034.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Un diagrama elaborado por agentes federales de la escena del tiroteo del 4 de octubre de Marimar Martínez en Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;También disputó la afirmación de Exum al Buró Federal de Investigaciones (FBI) de que Exum disparó los cinco tiros a Martínez a través del parabrisas delantero. Parente dijo que tres fueron disparados al lado del pasajero de la Rogue, un cuarto “rompe la ventana trasera del pasajero”, y un quinto fue desde la parte trasera del auto de Martínez hacia el asiento delantero del pasajero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parente comentó que le han dicho que hay una investigación en curso sobre la conducta de Exum por parte de la oficina del fiscal en South Bend, Indiana. Pero no está claro en qué estado se encuentra esa investigación.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parente y otros miembros del equipo legal de Martínez comentaron que planean presentar una queja bajo la Ley de Reclamaciones por Agravios Federales contra DHS y Exum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Este es un momento en el que simplemente no se puede confiar en las palabras de nuestros funcionarios federales”, aseguró Parente.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La evidencia en el caso de Martínez fue publicada el martes por la oficina del fiscal federal en Chicago, Andrew Boutros. Publicó los registros a pesar de que anteriormente se había opuesto a la divulgación de cierta evidencia, incluidos los mensajes de texto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La jueza de distrito Georgia Alexakis &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2026/02/09/jueza-federal-permitira-a-marimar-martinez-publicar-mensajes-de-texto-enviados-por-el-agente-que-le-disparo\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;le dio permiso a Martínez&lt;/a&gt; el viernes para liberar la evidencia de todos modos. Al liberarla el martes, los fiscales anticiparon la conferencia de prensa de Martínez el miércoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parente dijo que liberaron la evidencia “en el último momento en un intento mal guiado de minimizar cuán dañina que es para el gobierno”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El 4 de octubre, Martínez siguió a la Tahoe manejada por Exum. Tocó su claxon, gritó “la migra” y trató de advertir a las personas sobre los agentes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dijo que colocó su Rogue junto a la Tahoe cerca de 39th Street y Kedzie Avenue, donde afirmó que Exum giró hacia su Rogue y sus vehículos se rozaron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXGuQ7FrC38?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Border Patrol footage contradicts claims against Marimar Martinez\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;En las imágenes de la cámara corporal del incidente, se escucha a los agentes que viajan en la Tahoe diciendo “es hora de ser agresivos” y “vamos a hacer contacto, estamos atrapados”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exum parece girar el volante hacia la izquierda, hacia el auto de Martínez, mientras su Tahoe chocó con la Rogue. Exum le dijo al FBI que “desvió su vehículo a la izquierda” después de la colisión “en un intento de crear espacio”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sin embargo, eso desautoriza la afirmación inicial de DHS de que Martínez “embistió” la Tahoe de Exum con su Rogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Después de la colisión, se puede escuchar a un agente diciendo “nos han golpeado, nos han golpeado”. Exum también se baja del vehículo y se oyen cinco disparos fuera de cámara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martínez dijo que detuvo su Rogue, pero temía ser agredida por los agentes, por lo que se alejó. Comentó que manejó lo “más a la izquierda posible” para evitar que los agentes salieran de su vehículo a su derecha. Pero al pasar, dijo que Exum abrió fuego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-ed8681\" name=\"image-ed8681\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/612eb0b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0850f39/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a80d80/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mensaje de texto de Charles Exum\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a80d80/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e5c3f8a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a80d80/2147483647/strip/true/crop/906x508+0+278/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2Fa1%2F95667cda4987bbfc243ee84ae383%2Fexum1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mensajes de texto del agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza Charles Exum después del tiroteo de Marimar Martínez el 4 de octubre en Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorney’s office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exum escribió en un mensaje de texto que sus superiores lo habían apoyado después del tiroteo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Todos lo han sido, incluidos el jefe Bovino, el jefe Banks, la secretaria Noem y el [mismo] Jefe… según Bovino”, escribió Exum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El agente incluso compartió un mensaje de alguien en Vermont.

A nagging knee injury &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2025/09/25/white-sox-top-pitching-prospect-noah-schultz-embraces-growing-pains\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;cut his season short&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and prevented him from playing in the Arizona Fall League.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, the No. 72-ranked prospect, suffered his own bouts of inconsistency at Birmingham, but rebounded with &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2025/11/06/sox-prospect-hagen-smith-has-been-impressive-in-the-arizona-fall-league\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a strong Fall League showing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. His lengthy season has him a bit behind schedule entering camp at Camelback Ranch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His ramp up will be thoughtful, and we'll make sure that he's in a good spot to get going in his Triple-A season to be pitching every fifth day and eventually with us in Chicago,” Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a winter of rest — and a focus on finding consistency in his lanky mechanics — the 6-10 Schultz felt optimistic after throwing his first bullpen session Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last year, I would get a little wild, lose hitters, throw a couple walks in there. It's not something that I've been used to in the past, but it's good that I can get back up,” said Schultz, whose fastball has topped out at 99 mph. “I'm excited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-b20000\" name=\"image-b20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1247d05/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2726x1530+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4d%2F62%2Fd6a771c0425ba860752ebf687f6a%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-12-at-3-10-53-pm.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/59cb64e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2726x1530+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4d%2F62%2Fd6a771c0425ba860752ebf687f6a%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-12-at-3-10-53-pm.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a5d4c93/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2726x1530+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4d%2F62%2Fd6a771c0425ba860752ebf687f6a%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-12-at-3-10-53-pm.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"White Sox prospect Hagen Smith throws two innings of an Arizona Fall League game at Camelback Ranch in Glendale, Arizona, on Nov. 4, 2025.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a5d4c93/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2726x1530+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4d%2F62%2Fd6a771c0425ba860752ebf687f6a%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-12-at-3-10-53-pm.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/201a17d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2726x1530+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4d%2F62%2Fd6a771c0425ba860752ebf687f6a%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-12-at-3-10-53-pm.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a5d4c93/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2726x1530+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4d%2F62%2Fd6a771c0425ba860752ebf687f6a%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-12-at-3-10-53-pm.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;White Sox prospect Hagen Smith throws two innings of an Arizona Fall League game at Camelback Ranch in Glendale, Arizona, on Nov. 4, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Antonoff/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith — a barrel-chested 6-3, with a fastball touching 97 — posted a 3.57 ERA over 12 Double-A starts last year, but he walked 56 batters in 75⅔ innings to go with 108 strikeouts. “I hold myself to a high standard. I didn’t meet that last year,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spent his winter at home in eastern Texas dialing in his splitter/changeup in consultation with Sox pitching coaches. “I feel like I got a lot better this offseason and I want to prove it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shane Smith, Davis Martin and Anthony Kay — signed out of South Korea’s KBO league — are poised to hold down the top end of the Sox’ rotation entering the season, while a wide cast vie for the remaining slots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning right-hander and fellow KBO veteran Erick Fedde seems likely to get first crack at a spot after &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2026/02/11/erick-fedde-white-sox-return-prelander-berroa\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;signing a one-year, $1.5 million deal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another free-agent signing, Sean Newcomb, brings more experience for Venable to shore up the staff, while Jonathan Cannon and Sean Burke are looking to regain their footing after bumpy seasons last year that resulted in late-season demotions for both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grant Taylor and Mike Vasil are pushing for starting opportunities, too, after bullpen success last year, while newcomers Chris Murphy, Jedixson Paez and David Sandlin could warrant consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the winter, many fans had Schultz on that list of potentially cracking the big-league roster, too. While Venable hasn’t completely shut the door on that — anything’s possible at this early stage of the 2026 marathon — the towering lefty is not concerning himself with the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have a ton of goals. There's a lot of things I could say, and I think staying healthy is the No. 1 thing,” Schultz said. “Improving some of the things that probably took a dip last year every day. Just getting 1% better every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListL\" data-module  data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-4a0005\" name=\"list-4a0005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, pageCount=2422, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, carouselSpeed=null, buttonHoverBgColor=#a91d23, rteHeadingFont=font-1, secondaryColor=#656565, hideCategories=true, _template=/page/list/includes/PageList-header.hbs, font3=Arial, font4=Source-serif-4, ctaUrl=null, hideImage=false, footerLinkHoverColor=#d3242c, hideAudioPlayback=false, pullQuoteIcon=[{image=null, narrowImage=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=null}], description=[], showSecondItemMedia=false, listColumns234=null, footerTextColor=#ffffff, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox, headerSecondaryBgColor=#000000, primaryTextColorInverse=#ffffff, titleColor=null, ampLink=null, listHeaderPosition=null, hideDescriptions=false, items=[{type=Image, _styledTemplate=null, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports-media/2026/02/12/how-abs-challenge-system-will-affect-mlb-tv-broadcasts-chicago-cubs-white-sox-spring-training-schedules, timestamp=1770930317000, title=How ABS challenge system will affect MLB TV broadcasts, imageAlignment=null, publishDate=February 12, 2026 03:05 PM, isFeatured=false, target=null, primaryMediaType=null, ampLink=null, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/sports-media, category=[{items=[Sports Media]}], media=[{image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/25/43/fc01de0142bf993591d05dee1cab/screenshot-2026-02-12-at-2-49-03-pm.png, width=2506, height=1382}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/25/43/fc01de0142bf993591d05dee1cab/screenshot-2026-02-12-at-2-49-03-pm.png, width=2506, height=1382}, alt=Screenshot 2026-02-12 at 2.49.03 PM.png}], audio=[], wordCount=735, audioDuration=null, anchorId=promo-f80000, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/jeff-agrest, media=[{alt=11-20-stewart-agrest-2-0.jpg, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/aa/7e/6765027c315652b7137576f04898/11-20-stewart-agrest-2-0.jpg, width=512, height=512}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/aa/7e/6765027c315652b7137576f04898/11-20-stewart-agrest-2-0.jpg, width=512, height=512}}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[{items=[Jeff Agrest is deputy sports editor at the Chicago Sun-Times.]}], jobTitle=[{items=[Deputy sports editor]}], name=[{items=[Jeff Agrest]}]}], description=[{items=[ABS was the biggest topic of discussion at the annual MLB production meetings last month in New York.]}], _template=/page/promo/PagePromo.hbs}, {type=Image, authors=[{ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, media=[{alt=Mitchell Armentrout, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/fc/ce/f20d6ee54780a793233d9b8dc7ef/armentrout-01.jpg, width=5053, height=3370}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/fc/ce/f20d6ee54780a793233d9b8dc7ef/armentrout-01.jpg, width=5053, height=3370}}], jobTitle=[{items=[Reporter/assistant editor]}], name=[{items=[Mitchell Armentrout]}], authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/mitchell-armentrout, bio=[{items=[Mitchell Armentrout is a staff reporter covering government and politics from Chicago to Springfield, focusing on the expansion of gambling across Illinois as well as the Chicago Bears’ quest for a new stadium.

It also calls for hiring an additional 270 patrol officers and 90 patrol sergeants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of keeping a fixed number of officers in each district, the study argues that staffing should be adjusted regularly based on workloads. The department would also tackle challenges with oversight, with the study finding that “meaningful supervision becomes difficult” when sergeants are responsible for too many officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Boik, senior vice president of public safety at the Civic Committee of the Commercial Club of Chicago, one of the study’s sponsors, said a supervisor at a police district could be overseeing close to 20 officers at any given time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We've invested a lot in accountability structures, but the most important layer of accountability is that relationship between the supervisor and the employee,” Boik said in an interview. “You could be the best manager in the world, but 20 is too much.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark Henson and Boik said the key takeaway of the study is the long-term analytical model it provides for determining staffing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For years, CPD has deployed based on a set of internal metrics, and the study really provides a replicable, mathematically-based model that can serve as the basis for staffing for the first time ever and for years to come,” said Boik, Clark Henson’s predecessor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The staffing analysis was required under &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2018/9/6/18327050/what-is-a-consent-decree\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;a federal consent decree&lt;/a&gt; mandating sweeping reforms in the wake of the police killing of Laquan McDonald. Similar studies were commissioned in 2016 and 2019, but were never completed, and preliminary results weren’t made public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six funders, including the Civic Committee, stepped up to fund the study, which ended up costing $780,000, according to Boik. A final report is expected to be released to the public in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police officials now have to weigh the recommendations while considering budget constraints and collective bargaining agreements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm looking forward to the final product,” said police Supt. Larry Snelling. “I don't expect it to be 100% perfect. I do expect that there may be some things that we need to look at and talk about, which is why we have this draft right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Read the executive summary:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?embedded=true&amp;amp;url=https://www.chicagopolice.org/wp-content/uploads/WFA-ES.pdf\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024/2/5/24062649/how-best-deploy-chicago-police-officers-city-council-committee-vote\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;City Council committee OKs study on how best to deploy Chicago police as resources shrink, some crimes spike&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2024/10/25/chicago-police-department-exodus-suburbs-recruiting\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Chicago Police Department exodus: New cops are leaving in droves, Sun-Times investigation finds&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/11/05/chicago-police-hiring-slowdown-larry-snelling-brandon-johnson-budget\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;CPD to slow hiring, pause academy training next summer to cut costs, superintendent says&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Though ABS won’t be as impactful as the pitch clock, it will affect TV broadcasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strike-zone box, which has become as vital to baseball broadcasts as the first-down line on football broadcasts, will remain on the screen, but it no longer will indicate whether a pitch was a ball or a strike. In addition to showing the pitch speed and type, the box has marked a strike with a filled-in circle and a ball with a hollow circle. Home viewers might not have ever noticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change was made because that box now will be used for the ABS system, and MLB is doing everything it can to ensure no one can exploit it. In fact, MLB will allow the box to be shown in just one place in the ballpark: the broadcast booth. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viewers still will know whether an obvious call merits a challenge. Challenges must be made immediately, so there’s no chance of a viewer contacting the team in time. Besides, only the batter, pitcher or catcher can issue a challenge, and he can’t have any assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a player challenges a call, which he indicates by tapping his head, an animation of the pitch will be shown immediately on a videoboard in the stadium and on viewers’ screens. The call will be confirmed or overturned right then and there. No calls to replay umpires necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question for producers is how to display this for viewers. Do they add teams’ remaining challenges to an already-packed scorebug? How do they present the scene of challenges, which MLB said averaged only 14 seconds in spring-training trials last year?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect challenges to appear in the scorebug. They’re more likely to appear in a graphic that slides out from the bug, like broadcasts do with mound visits. Teams start each game with two challenges and lose them only if they fail, so they could challenge more than two pitches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Producers also could add drama to the scene by breaking the screen into boxes. Imagine a three-box with the graphic of the pitch and reactions from the batter and pitcher. In a key spot in the ninth inning, that could make for good TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How teams use challenges should make for good discussion among broadcasters. Producers have learned that teams already are discussing strategy, such as which players can or can’t initiate a challenge. Pitchers who think everything they throw is a strike and hitters who lack a great feel for the strike zone probably won’t be allowed to. And broadcasters will have more to discuss once enough data is compiled about team tendencies regarding challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the addition isn’t without headaches for production crews. MLB’s biggest point of emphasis at the production meetings was the change to the availability of the broadcast with the strike-zone box. MLB doesn’t want that feed shown anywhere in the ballpark, outside of the broadcast booth, to prevent teams from taking advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means players in the clubhouse and dugout and fans waiting in line for concessions won’t see the strike-zone box on nearby TVs. Technical teams from local and national outlets have spent a lot of time figuring out how to change the feeds they send through the ballpark. It won’t affect home viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Producers don’t expect ABS challenges to provide many dramatic moments to display, and they want to be careful not to overdo them. The challenge system might just blend into the game as quietly as the pitch clock has. But in big moments, those 14 seconds could provide some compelling sights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Remote patrol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs and White Sox announced their spring-training broadcast information this week:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• For the Cubs, Marquee Sports Network will air 11 games and The Score 10. Both will carry the Cubs’ first two games, the opener next Friday against the Sox and the game Feb. 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• For the Sox, Chicago Sports Network will air nine games, and 10 will air on ESPN 1000, which will carry the opener next Friday against the Cubs. CHSN will carry the next two games.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
