Lockport is one of those places. And younger fans may not realize that at its heart, Lockport is a basketball city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s probably one of the reasons two grown men ripped off their shirts and celebrated wildly on the court shortly after the host Porters knocked off rival Joliet West 58-30 on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/27/chicago-high-school-basketball-scores-illinois-ihsa-playoffs\"   &gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt; to win their first regional championship since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We just wanted it more,” Lockport junior Nedas Venckus said. “We came out ready to die on the court. We had to win.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Porters (27-5) had not even played in a regional title game for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was reminded a few times of the drought,” Lockport coach Dave Wilson said. “It was a goal of ours as a program. I’ve had a brilliant coaching staff and the kids bought in from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lockport is really good at a lot of sports, and they achieve at a high level. We talk about it as a basketball program. We watch football making runs in the state playoffs. We watch volleyball go down state. Softball, baseball. It is a challenge to keep up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson is in his third year at Lockport, and his team was at home and favored to win, but Joliet West (21-11) played very well against some of the best teams in the area over the final month of the regular season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tigers’ plan was physical man defense on Lockport’s star juniors, twins Nedas and Nojus Venckus. It worked very well for one quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the first quarter we could not move,” Wilson said. “So, we had to modify and adapt. The twins beat up on each other every day. There is nothing like brotherly physicality, brotherly love. Every day since they were two years old, they are beating each other up and it prepares them for a moment like this. They were able to weather the storm.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Porters brought the storm in the second quarter, limiting Joliet West to just one free throw. Lockport took total control of the game with a 22-0 and held the Tiger without a field goal for a 14:16 stretch that spanned from midway through the first quarter into the start of the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-110000\" name=\"image-110000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/43fe19f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2Ffc%2Fdb5ac43b47dfa45f66d239c16c91%2Fob-cst-022826-7008.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b1a9e95/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2Ffc%2Fdb5ac43b47dfa45f66d239c16c91%2Fob-cst-022826-7008.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e0f72e3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2Ffc%2Fdb5ac43b47dfa45f66d239c16c91%2Fob-cst-022826-7008.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Lockport&amp;#x27;s Nedas Venckus drives toward the basket during the Porters&amp;#x27; 58-30 win against Joliet West.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e0f72e3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2Ffc%2Fdb5ac43b47dfa45f66d239c16c91%2Fob-cst-022826-7008.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bb57e7f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2Ffc%2Fdb5ac43b47dfa45f66d239c16c91%2Fob-cst-022826-7008.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e0f72e3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2Ffc%2Fdb5ac43b47dfa45f66d239c16c91%2Fob-cst-022826-7008.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockport’s Nedas Venckus drives toward the basket during the Porters’ 58-30 win against Joliet West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before the game started coach said intensity is our competitive advantage,” Nojus Venckus said. “And straight from the jump we knew we had to be more intense, more aggressive than them. We tried to slow down because they are a fast team. You saw what happened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nedas Venckus finished with 15 points and five rebounds and Nojus added 14 points. Senior Trace Schaaf scored seven and point guard Nathan Munson added seven points and six assists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the Lockport adults were focused on the 15-year drought, but the players weren’t even aware of it until they snapped it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did not know before the game, but it feels great to be a part of history now,” Munson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua Calvert led Joliet West with eight points. Brockton Goehrke and Aamir Shannon each scored six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why you can’t expect things,” Tigers coach Jeremy Kreiger said. “You have to go earn them. We didn’t earn it. [Lockport] has played well all year, and they earned the right to cut their nets down on the home court. That is something those kids will never forget.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Porters will face Rich in the Class 4A Joliet West sectional semifinals on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Lockport dominates Joliet West 54-30 and celebrates its first regional title since 2011. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spoke to many long suffering Porters fans on the way out.

During the altercation, prosecutors said Alexander removed his bullet proof vest and threw it to the ground.

The victim's firearm was holstered at the time of the argument and the shooting. The defendant fled the scene and came into contact with another co-worker, whom he told that he had just shot Alexander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander was then taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he was pronounced dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin was arrested by authorities three blocks from his home approximately 20 minutes after the shooting, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin was detained and will appear in court again on March 17, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",

He offered to let the feds argue for a “reasonable”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;extension of time,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also told them,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“there’s no need to hold them until March 5 if they can be released more quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/04/chicago-trump-immigration-deportation-ice-raid-south-shore-midway-blitz\"   &gt;Building owner OK’d Trump administration’s raid of Chicago apartment complex, court records show&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The judge said he’s still considering how to rule in the cases of five additional people, meaning his final written order could apply to as many as 37 individuals. He ruled from the bench Friday during a hearing at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cummings said the individuals should be released “on their own recognizance, without conditions and without bond.” He considered the circumstances of roughly 50 people, following recent guidance and restrictions handed down by a federal appeals court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge found that many of the people now set for release were arrested without a warrant, and that agents lacked probable cause to believe they would escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling revolves around the so-called Castanon Nava settlement agreement. It restricts the ability of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and anyone working with them, to make warrantless arrests in Illinois and nearby states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Fleming, the associate director of federal litigation for the National Immigrant Justice Center who represents plaintiffs in the case, said “our singular goal right now is to get as many people out, where there were violations, as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We sense an urgency because people have been stuck, unlawfully, in detention for months now,” Fleming told reporters after court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/01/massive-immigration-raid-on-chicago-apartment-building-leaves-residents-reeling-i-feel-defeated\"   &gt;Massive immigration raid on Chicago apartment building leaves residents reeling: ‘I feel defeated’&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one of the 32 have already either been released or deported, Fleming later told the Chicago Sun-Times.

It’s called ‘‘positioning.’’ What NBA teams are being accused of doing and being heavily fined for — so far, commissioner Adam Silver has hit the Jazz and the Pacers with $500K and $100K fines, respectively — is not at all the same as what tanking has been accused of being in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is some new at-the-quarter-century break different-‘‘ish.’’ In ‘‘tanking,’’ you lose with intent. In ‘‘positioning,’’ the game within the game being played in the NBA, you simply don’t win with a plan. The difference is similar to reading this column and saying it’s not an ‘‘opinion,’’ it’s a ‘‘perspective.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at the core of it all — the crime of tanking, the art of positioning — coming in late June is an incoming rookie class predicted to be one the NBA has never seen before. Which has created this problem the NBA has never seen before. One the New York Times’ The Pulse asked (quasi-rightfully claimed!) if it’s ‘‘the best freshman class ever.’’ An answer just by sheer volume of the number of freshmen who are currently the best players in the NCAA is a resounding ‘‘Duh,’’ attached to the 99.9998% belief that most, if not all, who made The Athletic’s essential newsletter pose that extremely rhetorical question, ‘‘Are going to be in this year’s NBA Draft?’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mikel Brown Jr. (Louisville). Darryn Peterson (Kansas). AJ Dybantsa (BYU). Cameron Boozer (Duke). Caleb Wilson (UNC). Tounde Yessoufou (Baylor). Kingston Flemings (Houston). Keaton Wagler (Illinois). Darius Acuff (Arkansas). Brayden Burries (Arizona). Nate Ament (Tennessee). All are on something extra. All will be exactly what a specific team needs when it drafts him. The teams just have to be in the right position to get which player they want and would have still drafted had they had a higher-positioned pick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, there is a strong possibility that of the top 12 or 15 picks in this NBA Draft, 10 or 12 could be players who just finished their freshman seasons. All (with the exception of Burries) currently younger than 20 years old. Teams doing what has to be done to get first NBA dibs on one and signed to a rookie contract is called ‘‘vying for position,’’ not tanking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See, tanking is gambling. What’s going on with teams losing right now to get one of these prodigies on their roster is leveraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, this is about oversized-team-logo-card superiority. To get the top lottery pick or one of the top three lottery picks for the one or two generational players whose name former commissioner David Stern or current commish Silver would call first on draft night. But this time, every team that doesn’t make the play-in (this most definitely includes the Bulls, even as they unintentionally lose by default) wants to be in the best possible position to get one of the top eight, 10 or 12 players who could realistically be its version of franchise-changing. Whom that player is this year makes no difference. That’s the difference. They are all so close in skill level, skill sets, talent and promise that ‘‘generational’’ might reasonably apply to the first 10 picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So saying tanking is ‘‘rampant’’ and has been ‘‘worse this year than we’ve seen in recent memory,’’ as Silver did, or calling teams that seem to want to lose ‘‘tankers’’ or screaming, ‘‘Abolish the lottery,’’ in news headlines as if it were the new Jim Crow is not in any sense adequate. And trying to end or find a remedy for or fix it won’t work because the chances of having another draft class this dope and deep be available won’t happen again until the league announces it’s NBA100 team. Everyone’s diagnosis is wrong, so any solution to correct it is going to be wronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all of the anti-tanking cries and campaigns to de-emphasize losing — all concerns that will have their day in court during NBA meetings in the offseason — there’s a quiet hope that overzealousness and overreach don’t cloud the changes that will be enforced. With hope the league brain trust will realize how unicorns existed this year in college basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let’s hope the NBA keeps in mind that, when it comes to crime — even to those who happen to look at losing games to make their teams better as the sports version of a criminal activity, instead of savvy avoid-the-second-apron-by-any-means business maneuvering — the crooks are always going to be ahead of the rules and regulations. Regardless of what the NBA powers-that-be do or however ironclad they make new laws to stop them. Losing games is a part of the game; losing the game ain’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So can we just for this moment start the R.I.P.-ing of tanking and fully embrace the beauty of the long-game art of positioning? Stop referring to the art of it as a crime? If, for one season, it’s putting lipstick and eyelash extensions on a pig, then just let the pig have its ‘‘America’s Next Top Model’’ moment in this moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s chess, not dominoes. It’s the ‘‘lose a million to get 10 million’’ game plan. A single-season movement. It’s not intentionally losing; it’s the art of winning by not winning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Margaret Croke, D-Chicago, who is running for Illinois comptroller, reported receiving the maximum campaign contribution of $72,800 from Gov. JB Pritzker on Feb. 19. Since then, Pritzker has appeared in some Croke campaign ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day before the Pritzker contribution was reported, I spoke with incumbent Comptroller Susana Mendoza about the governor’s support of Croke — who once worked in Pritzker’s administration and has been a legislative ally — and the near certainty at the time that Pritzker would be contributing to Croke’s campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendoza has prided herself on being independent of Pritzker, and noted that she has never accepted contributions from the governor because of that, even when he offered to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While stressing that she has worked with the governor in the past, and saying “Honestly, all of the people running are good people,” Mendoza said, “I've always been super clear that I work for the taxpayers and any appearance of not full independence coming from the controller's office is, I think, unhealthy for Illinoisans,” adding, “I would not have accepted money from the governor.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendoza defeated appointed Republican Leslie Munger, who then-Gov. Bruce Rauner once called his “wingman,” so she’s sensitive to this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-b00000\" name=\"module-b00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendoza also admitted that she considers Democratic comptroller candidate Holly Kim a friend and “mentee,” who would make “a great comptroller.” Kim is the Lake County treasurer. Mendoza has not made an official endorsement as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I asked Croke for a response. She told me during an interview that the comptroller is an “independent office,” adding, “I've always been very vocal on where I stand on things. I mean, I'm the youngest of three. I've had to assert myself a long time. I think that the governor endorsing me is a reflection of the fact that I've worked incredibly hard on this campaign, and he knows that I'm going to do a good job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Croke said that Pritzker’s chief of staff Anne Caprara (who has, um, a quite persuasive style) is a “great example,” of how Pritzker “doesn't surround himself with 'yes people.' And I am not a 'yes person.' I think that he appreciates independence. I think he appreciates strong leadership. But what frustrates me sometimes is that people conflate independence with being adversarial, and that's just not my style. I've always been someone who is collaborative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would argue that Susana likes to make her position, especially when it is adversarial to any constitutional officer, like she wants to make sure everyone knows about it,” Croke continued. “I'm someone who I feel like we can get things done, that we can collaborate and everyone can know exactly where I stand at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Croke noted that other Democratic constitutional officers have received campaign contributions from Pritzker and nobody is questioning their independence. After she said that, I pointed out that Attorney General Kwame Raoul has received huge contributions from Pritzker (totaling almost $4 million), and Croke asked rhetorically, “And then do we question what cases Kwame decides to bring or not bring because of that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked the other Democratic comptroller candidates to comment on Gov. Pritzker’s contribution and Croke’s independence. Here are some excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• State Rep. Stephanie Kifowit, D-Oswego, appeared to criticize Pritzker’s endorsement earlier in February, obliquely pointing to Rauner’s backing of Munger. “Accepting money and support from the Governor is not something that shows the public an independent Comptroller,” she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Kim replied with a statement: “The Comptroller is supposed to be an independent watchdog, not an extension of the governor’s political operation. When Rep. Croke, or any candidate, is being bankrolled by the same Governor she may need to challenge, it’s safe to assume she’ll be paying for it with her loyalty later.” Kim then pointed to the Senate Democrats’ funding of state Sen. Karina Villa, D-West Chicago, and the support Villa and Kifowit both received from former House Speaker Michael Madigan. “None of my opponents have ever run independent campaigns — they’re political insiders who rely on insider relationships,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Villa said Mendoza is “right to be concerned,” about the Pritzker support, but pointed to what she said were “tens of thousands” of dollars from “from right wing MAGA donors,” concluding, “If you want Democrats to trust you to be the last line of defense against Trump's cuts, you probably shouldn't be cozying up to his donors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rich Miller also publishes Capitol Fax, a daily political newsletter, and CapitolFax.com.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-bf0000\" name=\"module-bf0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

But Skyline was more insulated because it has historically manufactured products locally. It’s the only large upholstered furniture maker near Chicago, according to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/02/14/skyline-furniture-manufacturing-poised-growth-ceo-wecker-keeping-careful-watch-economy\"   &gt;CEO Meganne Wecker&lt;/a&gt;, the third-generation owner of a family business her grandfather founded in 1946.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new workshop is equipped with hi-tech heavy machinery for cutting furniture frames and a new 3D frame design studio. It's the furniture maker’s third facility at its Thornton site in the south suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The expansion significantly reduces our exposure to overseas supply chain disruptions and price volatility,” Wecker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skyline expects the expansion to add about 50 people this year. That’s in addition to about 35 employees it hired last year for woodshop and printer roles, as well as operations, sales and more, bringing its total workforce to about 435. However, during stable times, Skyline would normally hire hundreds of workers each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-a00000\" name=\"module-a00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Skyline Furniture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;About:&lt;/b&gt; Wholesale furniture manufacturer&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Location:&lt;/b&gt; Thornton&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Owner:&lt;/b&gt; Meganne Wecker&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Founded:&lt;/b&gt; 1946&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Staff size:&lt;/b&gt; 435&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Estimated annual sales:&lt;/b&gt; $73 million&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company began sourcing materials from the U.S. in 2018, when Trump imposed tariffs during his first term. At the same time, freight rates from China were also increasing. “We started to see the writing on the wall,” Wecker said. In 2019, Skyline began sourcing metal for bed frames from Michigan instead of China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last fall, Trump threatened tariffs of 25% to 50% on some furniture products, but on Dec. 31, the White House announced a one year delay on those duties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the tariff moves forward, we expect to benefit from these measures over time as U.S.-made products become more competitive in the marketplace,” Wecker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are materials that Skyline can’t source domestically, such as hardwood from Asia used for dining chairs. In addition, knit velvets are made predominantly in China. Costs for fabrics rose 8% to 10%, due to tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skyline sources some fabric domestically and continues to invest in equipment to print fabrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses such as Skyline are still trying to understand the implications of the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling last week that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/economy/2026/02/20/supreme-court-trump-sweeping-tariffs-john-roberts-economic-agenda\"   &gt;certain tariffs were unconstitutional&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re operating in an era where contingency planning is essential for every small business,” Skyline said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-b80000\" name=\"image-b80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a155ceb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5131x2880+0+279/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F5b%2Faf6e9dc54fab9830bf0fd4e60a3f%2Fskyline-factory.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/08a9fec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5131x2880+0+279/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F5b%2Faf6e9dc54fab9830bf0fd4e60a3f%2Fskyline-factory.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/374bebf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5131x2880+0+279/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F5b%2Faf6e9dc54fab9830bf0fd4e60a3f%2Fskyline-factory.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Inside Skyline Furniture&amp;#x27;s factory\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/374bebf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5131x2880+0+279/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F5b%2Faf6e9dc54fab9830bf0fd4e60a3f%2Fskyline-factory.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff7fcd5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5131x2880+0+279/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F5b%2Faf6e9dc54fab9830bf0fd4e60a3f%2Fskyline-factory.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/374bebf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5131x2880+0+279/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F5b%2Faf6e9dc54fab9830bf0fd4e60a3f%2Fskyline-factory.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside Skyline Furniture’s factory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provided by Skyline Furniture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Skyline continued to its e-commerce business, which grew more popular during the pandemic. People are more accustomed to buying large items like furniture online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company’s two biggest challenges are broader economic uncertainty and hiring &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/work/2026/01/16/west-side-jarc-manufacturing-training-economic-mobility\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;skilled labor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After booming during the pandemic, home sales and renovations have stagnated in recent years due to rising interest rates, economic uncertainty and other factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people aren’t buying homes, they aren’t buying furniture, and when our retail partners are hurting, we feel it too,” Wecker said. “The furniture industry as a whole is hurting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s still tough for Skyline to find skilled manufacturing workers such as carpenters, foremen, machine operators and plant managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a country, we lack the expertise to run large-scale factory production, as this hasn’t been a focus for the past decade. The pipeline of college graduates trained for this type of manufacturing is very limited,” Wecker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government has been pushing to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., but that knowledge has been offshored, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The furniture industry has been on a roller coaster for the past five years, but Skyline’s sales rose 22% in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right now, it’s all about flexibility and being okay with the uncertainty of everything,” Wecker said. “It is difficult.

Both are adults in their early 30s. They have full-time jobs and make decent money, although they spend it as fast as they get it. My concern is their pot smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recreational marijuana is legal here as well as where they live. During their visit, they smoked joints before breakfast, mid-morning, after lunch, before dinner, after dinner and before bed. I would estimate they smoked five to seven joints a day apiece. They repeatedly commented that what they bought here was much stronger than what they could get at home. I suggested maybe they should, therefore, smoke a bit less, but I got a \"we're on vacation\" response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They interspersed the smoking with high-caffeine energy drinks. Both exhibited a lot of anxiety and paranoia. Multiple times, they drove their rented car after smoking, and they would have gotten a DUI had they been stopped for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said nothing about their pot consumption during the visit, but then I thought that if they had seen me with a fresh glass of wine in my hand at breakfast, followed by five or six more over the course of the day, they would have been concerned about my habits. Am I crazy to be concerned about theirs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know if this is how they spend their regular days off from work or if this was a vacation binge. Should I keep my mouth shut and just let it go, or should I try to discuss it with them now that their visit is concluded? — &lt;i&gt;OBSERVER IN OREGON&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR OBSERVER:&lt;/b&gt; How these fully employed relatives spend their money is not a subject you should raise. However, you do have the right to tell them you were concerned about not only the amount of pot they were smoking during their visit but also the fact that they were driving under the influence. Marijuana may be legal, but that does not make it advisable to use in every situation. Being stoned slows down reaction time and puts them and other drivers at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My fiance and I have been living with his parents for the past two years. We are ready to move, but it feels like his parents want us to live with them forever. I'm ready to just leave, but I don't want to cause drama. His father calls me rude names and fights with my fiance. I don't want my daughter living this way anymore. Should I just walk out, or should I explain to them first what our plans are and then leave? — &lt;i&gt;HAD ENOUGH IN THE SOUTH&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR HAD ENOUGH:&lt;/b&gt; I suspect there is at least one chapter and verse missing from your letter. Rather than leave in a huff or sneak away with no explanation, you and your fiance should thank his parents for allowing you to live with them for the last two years, tell them you have found a place of your own now and leave as pleasantly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Even outside the typical April–December season, crews have continued working during last month’s occasional mild weather to remove dead branches and hazardous trees along parkways and medians, proactively improving safety, reliability and quality of life for residents citywide. With more than 500,000 parkway trees, their work is never-ending as they also treat insect and disease threats while safeguarding and strengthening tree health across Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kudos to the leadership of the Department of Streets and Sanitation’s bureau of forestry for developing and executing a tree-trimming program rooted in service to all Chicago residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tom Tunney, former City Council member, 44th Ward&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-b90000\" name=\"module-b90000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give us your take&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Send letters to the editor to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

These apartments were among the most affordable remaining units in Rogers Park. More than a year before demolition began, Loyola forced out all low-income tenants despite having no immediate plans for redevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the university is creating yet another vacant lot across the street from property it cleared more than a decade ago that still sits empty. While the land waits for a potential CTA Red Line expansion and rising property values, Chicago has permanently lost more than two dozen affordable homes and dozens of valued Rogers Park neighbors who helped define the diversity and character that Loyola publicly claims to value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dave White, Rogers Park&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Extend Weber Spur Trail &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next \"606\" is closer than you may think. The proposed &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/livable-streets-chicago/home/_LS_projects/weber-spur-trail.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Weber Spur Trail &lt;/a&gt;would be an elevated right-of-way mixed-use trail on the Northwest Side. But unlike the 606, the Weber Spur Trail would connect the heart of the city with natural oases and green spaces, including the North Branch Trail, the Forest Preserves and suburban trails. The southern end of the trail would connect with the CTA's Montrose Blue Line and Metra Mayfair stations. In the process, the trail would traverse over two interstates, connecting communities that have been bisected by highways, and turn Portage Park into a gateway between city life and natural escapes. The potential is huge, and momentum for the trail has been growing. The trail is included in Chicago Department of Transportation's &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2022/march/CitywideVisionTrailsCorridors.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Trail Vision Map&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://nadignewspapers.com/federal-funds-awarded-for-planned-weber-spur-trail-on-chicagos-nw-side-as-project-delays-continue/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;recently awarded federal grant&lt;/a&gt; includes $850,000 for corridor planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the city has arbitrarily decided to cut off its plans for the Weber spur beyond &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/livable-streets-chicago/home/_LS_projects/weber-spur-trail.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Elston and Kimberly avenues&lt;/a&gt;, leaving its vision for the trail as no more than a quarter-mile stub past LaBagh Woods. Residents with existing access to green spaces would have yet another trail, but the rest of us would still be cut off, and on the wrong side of a highway or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Weber Spur to realize its potential, it must connect communities and cross active mobility barriers. This is not a pipe dream. The right-of-way crosses over the Edens Expressway a quarter-mile past the city’s chosen end point on Elston. A few hundred yards further, the right-of-way crosses over the Kennedy Expressway before concluding at Sunnyside Avenue, a planned neighborhood greenway and gateway to the Blue Line. The alignment is there. The bridges are there. Only the vision is missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone interested in advocating for the full Weber Spur Trail, can contact the Weber Spur Alliance at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:weberspuralliance@gmail.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;weberspuralliance@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thomas Lis, Weber Spur Alliance, Portage Park&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Public schools lose with federal tax credit scholarship program &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I write to respond to reader &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/letters-to-the-editor/2026/02/18/climate-change-finding-delivery-robots-super-bowl-bad-bunny-trump-valentines-day\"   &gt;Charles W. Murdock’s&lt;/a&gt; assertion that the federal tax credit scholarship program does not take away funds from public schools. Our federal (and state) tax dollars go into a large pot that funds many public goods, such as public schools and roads. Public schools have to serve all students. With &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48724\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;tax credit scholarships&lt;/a&gt;, you make a donation to one of the organizations specifically created to receive your donation. That money goes toward scholarships to private schools, which are not required to meet the needs of all students. These schools can deny admission to students with special needs or students whose identity does not align with their stated beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you get a tax credit for your donation, that means that you are not paying money into the pot that funds public schools (and roads and all the other public goods). So while these scholarships do not technically \"take money away\" from public schools, they function to reduce the pot that funds them. The outcome is the same. Yes, parents of private schools subsidize public schools that have to serve all students, the same way that we subsidize roads that we don’t drive on. This is funding for the public good. Tax-credit scholarships reduce the funding source for public schools. I urge Gov. JB Pritzker to say no to the federal tax credit scholarship program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Katie Gruber, parent of two Kenwood Academy High School students, Hyde Park&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reimagining Epstein saga through past American scandal &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The staggering incompetence regarding the Epstein files cover-up makes me pine for the cunning corruption of the Nixon administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know the story by now: the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/watergate\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Watergate Hotel&lt;/a&gt;, 1972.

Stephen Miller creeps through the door at the Watergate. It’s noon, of course, broad daylight. Does he know where the office he’s supposed to wiretap is? Of course not — he has to ask at the front desk. Pam Bondi is with him. The lady at the desk asks about the suspicious cords coming out of her bag. She mumbles something about the Dow Jones. Despite asserting presidential authority to be allowed to break in, they’re turned away. They get their parking validated, though, so Miller and Bondi high-five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter. They try again that night. Fewer people around, they figure. This time they bring Pete Hegseth (they wanted Robert F. Kennedy Jr., but he was busy being &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/newsom-bans-kid-rock-california-rfk-jr-video-b2926601.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;shirtless with Kid Rock.&lt;/a&gt;) A worker offers to let them in (he’s a big MAGA guy). Hegseth punches him anyway. He flexes and shows off his new back tattoo: \"Maximum lethality, not tepid legality!\" How cool are we, the intruders think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They stumble upstairs to the Democrat offices. Bondi forgot the flashlights, earning a reproach from Miller. She reminds him he isn’t a lawyer. They hit the lights. On a desk is a strongly worded letter from Chuck Schumer. As with all strongly worded letters from Chuck Schumer, this one is ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They successfully bug the phones, but it turns out that most of the calls are just Gavin Newsom wondering which office is going to be his. The scandal is exposed by every major news outlet (except, somehow, The Washington Post).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller tells Trump what a \"cover-up\" is. Donald likes the idea. He spins a \"Wheel-O-Missiles.\" Will it land on Tehran? Venezuela? Greenland? Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick put an X through \"stimulus checks,\" though; after using that one twice, people are starting to get suspicious. Trump wants music for the big moment. He looks at the playlist. \"Entry of the Gladiators\" sounds cool. It isn’t. The wheel spins …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;James Ross, West Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stop attack on Iran &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/israel-us-attack-iran-trump-says-major-combat-operations/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; on Iran is wrong, morally and strategically.

Rather, many Illinois residents are running out of patience with their greedy owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did anyone notice how spectacular Soldier Field and the city of Chicago looked in the TV coverage of the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Bears&lt;/a&gt;' playoff games this year? I recently drove through the area in &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears-stadium/2026/02/19/chicago-bears-stadium-hammond-indiana-move\"   &gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; that is being proposed for the stadium and couldn’t help but compare the two areas. If the Bears management would rather have Indiana taxpayers build them a \"world class stadium” surrounded by oil refineries, steel plants, casinos and swamps, that’s their choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I’m not interested in paying for owners who are more motivated by greed than loyalty to the city and state that’s paid their way all these years. I hope that the Illinois Legislature will not give the Bears one cent of tax money or tax breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things change. We will adjust. Go ahead and move.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;On a clear day, the Bears may even have a view of the magnificent Chicago skyline that they used to be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leonard Harsy, Cathedral District&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Changing tunes &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A line in \"Bear Down, Chicago Bears,\" is, \"You're the pride and joy of Illinois.\" If the Bears move to Indiana, will words to the fight song change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Larry E.

It is &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.7743\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;tied to lower IQ&lt;/a&gt; and results in decreased earning potential, as well as higher health costs.

There, the moderately benign mercury is transformed by bacteria into a toxic organic form called methylmercury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each bacterium might contain only one unit of toxic methylmercury, but a worm chewing through sediment and eating 1,000 of those bacteria now contains 1,000 doses of mercury. The catfish that eats the worm then get more doses, and so on up the food chain to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, top-level predator fishes, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/news/state-news-release/smallmouth-bass-mercury-levels-linked-habitat-types-along-snake-river\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;such as smallmouth bass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.ndow.org/blog/mercury-in-fish/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;walleye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/seafood/PDF2/FAQs/LakeMadisonvilleQA_2009.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;largemouth bass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://fwp.mt.gov/binaries/content/assets/fwp/aboutfwp/regions/r1/fishing-info/fhl-fishconsbrochure.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;lake trout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://seafood.oregonstate.edu/sites/agscid7/files/snic/an-expectant-mothers-guide-to-eating-minnesota-fish.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Northern pike&lt;/a&gt;, typically contain the highest amounts of mercury in river and lake ecosystems. These fish can contain enough mercury to be &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC128404/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;considered dangerous&lt;/a&gt; for the developing fetuses of pregnant women and for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How coal plant mercury rains down&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our study, we wanted to answer a simple question: Did the local coal-burning power plants, known to be &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11270-010-0703-7\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;major emitters of toxic mercury&lt;/a&gt;, have an impact on the local environment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The obvious answer seems to be yes, they do. But in fact, quite a bit of research – and coal industry advertising – noted that mercury is a “&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/etc.1980\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;global pollutant&lt;/a&gt;” and could not necessarily be traced to a local source. A recurring argument is that mercury deposited on the landscape came from coal-burning power plants &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.1021/es062707c\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;in China&lt;/a&gt;, so why regulate local emissions if others were still burning coal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That justification was based on the unique chemistry of this element. It is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature, and when heated just to a moderate level, will evaporate into mercury vapor. Thus, when coal is burned in a power plant, the mercury that is present in it is released through the smokestacks as a gas and dilutes as it travels. Low levels of mercury also &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.epa.gov/international-cooperation/mercury-emissions-global-context\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;occur naturally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this argument was technically true, we found it obscured the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found the overwhelming source of mercury was within sight of the White River fishermen – a large coal-burning power plant on the edge of the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This power plant emitted vaporous mercury at the time, though it has since &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.aesindiana.com/press-release/ipl-burns-coal-last-time-harding-street-station\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;switched to natural gas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that much of the plant’s mercury rapidly reacted with other atmospheric constituents and water vapor to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11270-010-0703-7\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;“wash out” over the city&lt;/a&gt;. It was &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/gbc.20040\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;raining down mercury on the landscape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Traveling by air and water, miles from the source&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercury emitted from the smokestacks of coal-fired power plants can fall from the atmosphere with rain, mist or chemical reactions. Several studies have shown &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2016.01.026\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;elevated levels of mercury in soils and plants near power plants&lt;/a&gt;, with much of the mercury &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/srep46545\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;falling within about 9 miles&lt;/a&gt; (15 kilometers) of the smokestack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we surveyed hundreds of surface soils ranging from about 1 to 31 miles (2 to 50 km) from the coal-fired power plant, then the single largest emitter of mercury in central Indiana, we were shocked. We found &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.12952/journal.elementa.000059\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;a clear “plume” of elevated mercury&lt;/a&gt; in Indianapolis, with much higher values near the power plant tailing off to almost background values 31 miles downwind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White River flows from the northeast to the southwest through Indianapolis, opposite the wind patterns. When we sampled sediments from most of its course through central Indiana, we found that mercury levels started low well upstream of Indianapolis, but &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11270-010-0703-7\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;increased substantially&lt;/a&gt; as the river flowed through downtown, apparently accumulating deposited mercury along its flow path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also found high levels well downstream of the city. Thus a fisherman out in the countryside, far away from the city, was still &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.12952/journal.elementa.000059\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;at significant risk&lt;/a&gt; of catching, and eating, high-mercury fish. Large coal-burning power plants associated with steel production in northwest Indiana may similarly &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/environmental-health-protection/toxicology/fish-advisories/methylmercury-facts.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;affect the greater Chicago area&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EPA created the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule, or MATS, to deal with this health risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://eelp.law.harvard.edu/2017/09/mercury-and-air-toxics-standards/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;rule stipulated&lt;/a&gt; that mercury sources had to be sharply reduced. For coal-fired power plants, this meant either installing costly mercury-capturing filters in the smokestacks or converting to another energy source. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Many converted to natural gas&lt;/a&gt;, which reduces the mercury risk but still contributes to health problems and global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MATS rule &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-reaffirms-scientific-economic-and-legal-underpinnings-limits-toxic-emissions\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;succeeded in reducing mercury emissions&lt;/a&gt; from power plants &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-04/fact-sheet_mats-rtr-final_rule_2024.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;by an estimated 90%&lt;/a&gt;. It also helped tilt the national energy playing field away from coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration announcement on Feb. 20, 2026, that it had repealed the 2024 updates to MATS will no doubt be &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/press-releases/epa-dismantles-protections-mercury-and-air-toxics-power-plants%22%22\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;challenged in court&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some economists initially calculated the net cost of the 2012 MATS rule to the U.S. electricity sector to be about &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nera.com/content/dam/nera/publications/archive2/PUB_MATS_Rule_0312.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;$9.6 billion per year&lt;/a&gt; in 2012 dollars. That was roughly equal to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.7743\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;estimates of productivity loss&lt;/a&gt; alone from the harm mercury emissions cause.

Jesse Jackson spoke, people listened. His ability to command a room was renowned. His impact and historical significance are unquestionable. It was an honor to photograph him over the years during my career as a photojournalist in Chicago. It was also a privilege to document the thousands who came from all over the country to pay their respects on the first of two days the civil rights leader was lying in repose at his nonprofit, the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How I got this photo&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of mourners were lined up at 10 a.m. Thursday, waiting for Jackson's family and Rainbow PUSH to open the doors to the public. As the moment drew nearer, Pam Hooks, who traveled to Chicago the day before from Cocoa, Florida, started Jackson's empowering and rhythmic chant, \"I am somebody!\" As members of the crowd joined her in the chant and raised their fists to the sky, Hooks turned her eyes upward. I dropped down to one knee so that trees, buildings and surrounding neighborhood in the background wouldn't interfere with the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Technical details:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-64bc1293-1412-11f1-899c-3f4e65dc7f2d\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Equipment: Canon EOS R5 with an RF 24-70mm f/2.8L IS USM lens&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focal length: 64mm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aperture: f/2.8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exposure: 1/5000&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ISO: 320&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/26/rev-jesse-jackson-lying-in-repose-rainbow-push-chicago\"   &gt;As thousands gather for viewing of Rev.

It all started with him “seeing smoke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flournoy, 74, is incarcerated at Pinckneyville Correctional Center, a medium security prison almost five hours south of Chicago. He’s been in Illinois prisons since the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His vision started to deteriorate early in his imprisonment, and he was diagnosed with glaucoma in 2002. But when his eyesight started looking hazy, he didn’t know what was happening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m telling myself, I know I’m in a no-smoking institution,” he told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A doctor eventually told him in 2007 that his untreated glaucoma was destroying his optic nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While incurable, glaucoma is easily manageable with daily prescription eye drops, the sort that a patient with insurance can get for as little as $10. But for years, as he moved from one state prison to the next, he’d never get the drops with any kind of consistency. He might get them regularly for a time. At others, he’d go months without them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spent years filing grievances within the prison, and sent complaints to the governor’s office. He even won two settlements after suing over his vision issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And after five surgeries, he’s lost all vision in his left eye. He’s now waiting for the day he wakes up and can’t see out of his right. Yet he still isn't getting his drops regularly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They let me go blind,” he said, “and they still ain’t doing nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDOC did not comment on Flournoy’s medical history or his allegations of neglect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-fb0000\" name=\"image-fb0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/06f674b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4635x2601+0+245/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff5%2Fad%2F892a7005445faaa5ef47c0b7ae2b%2Fprisonhealth-12xx25-010.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e185cb2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4635x2601+0+245/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff5%2Fad%2F892a7005445faaa5ef47c0b7ae2b%2Fprisonhealth-12xx25-010.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a8f0dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4635x2601+0+245/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff5%2Fad%2F892a7005445faaa5ef47c0b7ae2b%2Fprisonhealth-12xx25-010.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"PRISONHEALTH-12XX25-010.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a8f0dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4635x2601+0+245/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff5%2Fad%2F892a7005445faaa5ef47c0b7ae2b%2Fprisonhealth-12xx25-010.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e957b97/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4635x2601+0+245/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff5%2Fad%2F892a7005445faaa5ef47c0b7ae2b%2Fprisonhealth-12xx25-010.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a8f0dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4635x2601+0+245/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff5%2Fad%2F892a7005445faaa5ef47c0b7ae2b%2Fprisonhealth-12xx25-010.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnnie Flournoy holds his prison-issued magnifying glass at Pinckneyville Correctional Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flournoy’s story of decades of medical neglect is a common one in Illinois prisons. It’s a full-blown crisis where the state’s critically understaffed facilities struggle to deliver proper correctional medicine to the tens of thousands of inmates in their care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s despite being under a consent decree, or court-enforceable settlement agreement, to improve health care since 2019. The Illinois Department of Corrections continues to fail to provide adequate medical and dental care to incarcerated people, according to reports from an independent court-appointed monitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monitor’s ninth report, filed last month, listed several deficiencies and echoed the findings from previous reports. They included, among other issues:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-862eef11-1345-11f1-91a2-275efaeb8c42\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;The department only employs the equivalent of 16 full-time physicians across its 29 correctional facilities, which house more than 30,000 people. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The department is given a budget for roughly 33 full-time physicians. Even though the monitor says staffing is \"dangerously low\" and advises IDOC to \"increase budgeted physician staffing,\" the department claims it’s in compliance with the consent decree’s staffing requirements without giving evidence as to how.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High turnover also plagues IDOC. Over the last six years, 49 physicians have resigned, the monitor reported.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About 60% of nursing staff positions are vacant, and about a quarter of the facilities don't have a medical director to oversee care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The department has not implemented a policy for analyzing staff workload and tracking filled and vacant positions. IDOC has also not supplied the monitor with clinical performance reviews for physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants. Nor have they shared disciplinary records for those professionals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vast majority of patient records are on paper and have not been digitized, which the monitor described as \"inefficient, unreliable, and inadequate.\" A lack of electronic medical records makes it difficult to ensure continuity of care or to track patient's medical conditions, the monitor says.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in a review of 15 deaths in custody since the last report in 2024, the monitor learned that three people died from asthma, deaths the monitor said were preventable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are sentenced to prison. They’re not sentenced to die from preventable diseases,” said Alyssa Meurer, a lawyer with the Uptown People’s Law Center and a member of the legal team for the class-action lawsuit that triggered the consent decree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An IDOC spokesperson shared a statement saying the department is \"committed to providing safe, high-quality, and clinically appropriate healthcare to individuals in our custody and maintains a growing Office of Health Services (OHS) that oversees healthcare delivery across the Department.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the spokesperson did not answer a detailed list of questions about the current state of healthcare in Illinois' prison system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘The reality is they’ve done very little.’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDOC entered into the consent decree following a class-action lawsuit against the department for inadequate health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit began with Don Lippert. While incarcerated at Stateville Correctional Center in 2010, he claimed that he was denied his twice-daily insulin shots, sending him into diabetic shock. His suit has since expanded to cover all individuals in state custody who have serious medical and dental needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the consent decree, the state promised to make systemic reforms to the prison health care system. The judge overseeing the agreement assigned an independent monitor to provide updates to the court and observe whether the state is making good on its promises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mandated reforms include: hire more qualified staff; implement an electronic medical record system; improve facilities and equipment to meet medical needs; maintain reliable and up-to-date data; and create an organizational structure that ensures inmates get the care they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a special report from September, the monitor wrote: \"At the six-year mark in the Consent Decree, IDOC has not achieved any of these provisions, significantly hindering compliance and improvements in care.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That continues to be the case, legal experts told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-db0000\" name=\"image-db0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aa1a47f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5995x3365+0+316/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fa9%2Fdbaea6ce4939a9fcbd298cd87805%2Fprisonhealth-260301-5.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/89328f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5995x3365+0+316/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fa9%2Fdbaea6ce4939a9fcbd298cd87805%2Fprisonhealth-260301-5.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c23c36/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5995x3365+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fa9%2Fdbaea6ce4939a9fcbd298cd87805%2Fprisonhealth-260301-5.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"PRISONHEALTH_260301_5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c23c36/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5995x3365+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fa9%2Fdbaea6ce4939a9fcbd298cd87805%2Fprisonhealth-260301-5.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a1462f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5995x3365+0+316/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fa9%2Fdbaea6ce4939a9fcbd298cd87805%2Fprisonhealth-260301-5.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c23c36/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5995x3365+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fa9%2Fdbaea6ce4939a9fcbd298cd87805%2Fprisonhealth-260301-5.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samantha Reed, attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, speaks to a reporter at the Uptown People’s Law Center office in Uptown, Wednesday, Feb. 18, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first step to making change is admitting you have a problem, and I think that’s something the state struggles with,” said Samantha Reed, a lawyer with ACLU Illinois and a member of the class-action suit’s legal team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The reality is they’ve done very little,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the few areas where IDOC has complied with the consent decree is improving the department's written policies. A spokesperson told the Sun-Times that the department overhauled its quality improvement directive, quality management program and quality improvement manual. The spokesperson also said the department has a \"robust\" compliance unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But improving policy is just one step, said Meurer with the Uptown People's Law Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The monitor has repeatedly stated that IDOC does not have the adequate staff to implement the policies,\" she said. \"So there's change on paper, but it has not actually effectuated any change within the facilities day to day with patient care.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDOC's private vendors are also a part of the problem, like its longtime health care provider Wexford Health Sources, said Meurer and Reed.

In previous reports, the court monitor also found serious deficiencies in Wexford's practices and documented deaths from substandard medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDOC abruptly ended its contract with Wexford last summer after negotiations stalled. The state entered an emergency contract with Centurion Health, another for-profit, private health care provider for prisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/12/10/prison-health-care-illinois-centurion\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;A Sun-Times investigation last year&lt;/a&gt; into Centurion's record found that people under the company's care say they were repeatedly ignored, denied care and misdiagnosed. In lawsuits from several state prisons, a pattern emerged: Inmates would repeatedly complain about a health issue, were ignored by correctional and medical staff members, and their condition would worsen to the point of dangerous complications or death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Centurion took over last year, incarcerated people across the state have said their health care has not improved under the new company. Some claim that they, like Flournoy, continue to deal with lapses in care including inconsistently receiving medications and not getting them on time. they &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centurion did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d40000\" name=\"image-d40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f047fe6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6574x3689+0+347/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F43%2Ff6%2Fc60adda548fea81d70e9287936ff%2Fprisonhealth-260301-6.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6400a46/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6574x3689+0+347/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F43%2Ff6%2Fc60adda548fea81d70e9287936ff%2Fprisonhealth-260301-6.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fa65152/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6574x3689+0+347/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F43%2Ff6%2Fc60adda548fea81d70e9287936ff%2Fprisonhealth-260301-6.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"PRISONHEALTH_260301_6.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fa65152/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6574x3689+0+347/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F43%2Ff6%2Fc60adda548fea81d70e9287936ff%2Fprisonhealth-260301-6.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e72677e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6574x3689+0+347/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F43%2Ff6%2Fc60adda548fea81d70e9287936ff%2Fprisonhealth-260301-6.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fa65152/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6574x3689+0+347/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F43%2Ff6%2Fc60adda548fea81d70e9287936ff%2Fprisonhealth-260301-6.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alyssa Meurer, an attorney with Uptown People’s Law Center, speaks with a reporter at the Uptown People’s Law Center office in Uptown, Wednesday, Feb. 18, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Reed and Meurer readily call for companies like Wexford and Centurion to be held accountable, it's the state's constitutional duty to ensure the people locked up have adequate health care, they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The state is confining people and preventing them from accessing health care on their own,\" Meurer said. \"There's a reason why we're not suing Centurion or Wexford.

And even when they get medical appointments, they frequently miss them because there isn't a correctional officer who can take them or the prison is on lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"They are technically wards of the state, and we know from a lot of research that prison creates worse health outcomes,\" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take the case of Anthony Rodesky, who has been locked up in Illinois prisons for more than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-dc0000\" name=\"image-dc0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/26fbe08/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+165/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5e%2F7a%2Fe4d14c9c42d9a44964fafec4b944%2Fillinois-budget-tamms.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9f4d95d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+165/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5e%2F7a%2Fe4d14c9c42d9a44964fafec4b944%2Fillinois-budget-tamms.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a1f40c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+165/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5e%2F7a%2Fe4d14c9c42d9a44964fafec4b944%2Fillinois-budget-tamms.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Illinois Budget Tamms\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a1f40c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+165/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5e%2F7a%2Fe4d14c9c42d9a44964fafec4b944%2Fillinois-budget-tamms.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fb21930/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+165/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5e%2F7a%2Fe4d14c9c42d9a44964fafec4b944%2Fillinois-budget-tamms.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a1f40c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3200x1796+0+165/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5e%2F7a%2Fe4d14c9c42d9a44964fafec4b944%2Fillinois-budget-tamms.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This April 5, 2012, file photo shows the now-defunct Tamms Correctional Center, Illinois’ only super-maximum-security prison in Tamms, Ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Jahnke/AP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While housed at the now-closed \"supermax\" Tamms Correctional Center in 2011, Rodesky started developing painful blisters and sores on his right foot, according to his wife, Ranota Rodesky. As a Type II diabetic, he has long dealt with poor circulation. But the prison denied him bandages and properly fitting shoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sores only got worse and his foot was operated on several times until he was diagnosed with a bone infection that triggered gangrene. By 2015, when he was at Pontiac Correctional Center, his leg was amputated below the knee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sued IDOC and Wexford. In July 2021, a federal jury awarded him $400,000 and he settled separately with Wexford. Despite that victory, Rodesky's care hasn't improved, his wife said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The money's not getting him the care he needs, and it's not getting any accountability,\" Ranota Rodesky said. \"Just because you settle a lawsuit doesn't mean you're admitting that you were at fault. You're just doing what you can to brush this away.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, Anthony Rodesky has been dealing with a new, dire medical issue. About seven months ago, the 55-year-old noticed a lump on his throat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It got real big fast, and he's been losing a lot of weight fast,\" said Ranota Rodesky, who lives in New Jersey where her husband was originally sentenced. \"It started out like a quarter, and now it's like the size of a baseball.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodesky said it took six separate emergency requests for her husband to get a CT scan, which he finally got earlier this month. But he hasn't been able to get an appointment to go over the results nor has the lump been biopsied. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he was just transferred from Pinckneyville to Menard Correctional Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranota Rodesky worries the lump on his throat is cancerous. If it is, she plans to move to Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I'm gonna be their worst nightmare. They got the wrong husband,\" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDOC did not comment on Rodesky's medical history and his allegations of neglect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘I’m not going to lose my mind’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Pinckneyville, Flournoy mostly keeps to himself. He carries a small magnifying glass to help him see and a digital watch that reads out the time and date — critical tools he fought to get for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has other medical issues that aren’t getting proper treatment, including a hernia, polyps on his colon and a heart arrhythmia. He walks with a cane. He wears an eye patch made out of a shoelace and a piece of cloth over his glassy left eye and drooping eyelid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his family is fighting for him. Family is everything to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he has an issue, his little sister Patricia Brown will doggedly call the warden’s office and prison medical director, not letting up until he gets help. She’s his crusader. They talk everyday, whether about the movies they’ve seen or the next time they’ll see each other in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He keeps telling me any chance he’s got, ‘Just hold on. I’m coming home,’” Brown said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-b20000\" name=\"image-b20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53cd600/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F6e%2F4963df4d45fb9e7fc108b1e024ba%2Fprisonhealth-260301-17.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b8baf94/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F6e%2F4963df4d45fb9e7fc108b1e024ba%2Fprisonhealth-260301-17.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7800e67/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F6e%2F4963df4d45fb9e7fc108b1e024ba%2Fprisonhealth-260301-17.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"PRISONHEALTH_260301-17.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7800e67/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F6e%2F4963df4d45fb9e7fc108b1e024ba%2Fprisonhealth-260301-17.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c4879a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F6e%2F4963df4d45fb9e7fc108b1e024ba%2Fprisonhealth-260301-17.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7800e67/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F6e%2F4963df4d45fb9e7fc108b1e024ba%2Fprisonhealth-260301-17.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patricia Brown shows a photo of her brother Johnnie Flournoy at her home in Morgan Park, Thursday, Feb. 19, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flournoy collects the medical records he receives and the grievances he files and sends copies to his family home in Morgan Park on the South Side.

I told my sister when my sight is gone, just get me an old hi-fi, get me the oldies and get me my headphones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn’t always feel that way. Years ago, as he despaired about not getting his eye drops, he thought about the most shocking ways to get the public’s attention on his condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I need to carve in my body what’s going on and commit suicide,” he thought. His body would get transferred to Chicago, where his family and the media would see what happened to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And people will wake up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c80000\" name=\"image-c80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b63fb4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2Fb8%2Fb4c8904b4965a901993bc5eae1a8%2Fprisonhealth-12xx25-015.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/687b0a3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2Fb8%2Fb4c8904b4965a901993bc5eae1a8%2Fprisonhealth-12xx25-015.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2a2027/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2Fb8%2Fb4c8904b4965a901993bc5eae1a8%2Fprisonhealth-12xx25-015.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"PRISONHEALTH-12XX25-015.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2a2027/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2Fb8%2Fb4c8904b4965a901993bc5eae1a8%2Fprisonhealth-12xx25-015.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0192e10/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2Fb8%2Fb4c8904b4965a901993bc5eae1a8%2Fprisonhealth-12xx25-015.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2a2027/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7a%2Fb8%2Fb4c8904b4965a901993bc5eae1a8%2Fprisonhealth-12xx25-015.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inmate Johnny Flournoy (right) walks to lunch using his IDOC issued cane at Pinckneyville Correctional Center in Perry County on Monday, Nov. 17, 2025.

When he can’t sleep, he takes them from his Roslyn home, on Long Island, to open his own hockey barn in nearby Syosset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the devotion and passion we admire, why we invested in the Quinnipiac Bobcats, at 15-to-1 odds, to win the upcoming NCAA Frozen Four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, college hockey’s premier event will be staged in Las Vegas, April 9-11 at T-Mobile Arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his savvy skills, maybe even a lucky bounce or two, we hope to see Ethan’s No. 19 sweater inside T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Wyttenbach left a top marketing post in New York City to build, with two other families, a $1.5 million ice palace that’s connected to another indoor sports facility in Syosset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the start, Andrew recently told the New York Post, of Ethan “really taking his love to another level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Flames took the 5-10, 180-pound left winger in the fifth round of the 2025 NHL Draft. Having recently turned 19, today he stands tall atop Division I hockey with 1.59 points per game for Quinnipiac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In excavating D-I hockey, to wet my beak for a Frozen Four in my own backyard, I kept landing on Quinnipiac, veteran coach Rand Pecknold and Wyttenbach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 20, I scrambled to the Circa Sports outlet inside the Silverton Casino to nab that 15-1 ticket, the sole piece of my college-hockey portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Confidence game&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a bit late to the Quinnipiac party because Circa had opened its odds at 30-1 several weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, I deemed 15-1 excellent value because the returns on Michigan and Michigan State (at +400 each, or risk $100 to win $400) and North Dakota and Western Michigan (+850 apiece) paled by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, I consider Quinnipiac a top squad, with a scoring margin of 2.15; the Bobcats have been flip-flopping with Michigan for that top spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bobcats’ prowess is due to Ethan Wyttenbach. In 32 games, he notched 22 goals and 32 assists for a D-I-best 54 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through last weekend, he had nine goals and 12 assists in a 10-game run in which Quinnipiac went 7-1-2; it included his first college hat trick in an 8-0 smashing of Yale on Feb. 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Dartmouth freshman Hayden Stavroff (.280) has sported a more lethal shot than Wyttenbach’s 25.6% scoring rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think I’m surprising people in some aspects,” Ethan told the Quinnipiac Chronicle. “It’s just a confidence thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His grandfather Heinz played professionally in Switzerland, and his three sons all played at Cornell. Islanders legend Butch Goring, a neighbor and Heinz pal, occasionally brought the Stanley Cup to the Wyttenbach home for family gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it’s pronounced QUIN-ih-pee-ack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tough competition&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also like that the Bobcats own the best faceoff percentage of 56.9, ahead of Colorado College (55.2) and Bowling Green (54.7), in D-I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michigan State has solid scorers in Porter Martone (0.71 goals per game) and Charlie Stramel (0.63), and Penn State trumpets two keen assist men in Gavin McKenna (1.07) and Aiden Fink (1.00).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinnipiac, though, has been dominating the challenging ECAC, which it is in line to win for a 12th time, including seven in the last eight seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(The meat of the ECAC playoffs begin March 13; the 16-team national tournament starts March 26.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pecknold guided the Bobcats to Frozen Fours in 2013 and ’16, and in 2023, they won their first national title with a 3-2 overtime victory over Minnesota in Tampa, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(In ’13, the Bobcats lost in the final 4-0 to Yale in Pittsburgh; three years later, they dropped the title game 5-1 to North Dakota in Tampa.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pecknold, 59, took over D-II Quinnipiac in 1994 and steered it into D-I in ’98. Only he (691 wins through Feb. 21), Boston’s Jack Parker (897) and Michigan’s Rod Berenson (848) have won more than 600 games at one program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Ethan] finishes plays,” Pecknold told the Chronicle. “There’s a lot of players at our level that create a lot of offense . . . [but] he’s got that next gear, and he has that ability to finish those chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s just next level, with not just the goal scoring but also the passes and the timing, and he just finishes plays.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Vegas, revisited&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which came first, the rink or Ethan’s fire for hockey?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told the Post, “I didn’t play the game to be mediocre . . . really, if you’re going to skate every day, that’s how you know you’re committed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie McAvoy (Bruins) and Adam Fox (Rangers) spent time skating for the Long Island Gulls, a sterling Syosset youth program for whom Ethan played.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So did Jeremy Wilmer, a Quinnipiac forward, and Bobcats commits Jack Genovese and Nicolas Sykora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his own rink, Ethan does not take his good fortune for granted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you think about it, put it kind of into perspective,” he told his school paper, “it’s super cool.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, Ethan and the Gulls won a top-tier 16-and-under national tournament in Las Vegas. He scored four times and had an assist; he punched in the overtime winner that sent the Gulls to the championship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So the plan this season is, obviously, to get to Vegas,” Ethan said. “I think winning a national championship in Vegas again would be pretty cool.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethan, so do I. Indeed, it would be super cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NCAA HOCKEY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To win title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Odds Team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+400 Michigan, Michigan State&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;+870 North Dakota, Western Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;13-1 Penn State&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;15-1 Quinnipiac&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;19-1 Boston College, Denver,&lt;br&gt;Providence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;20-1 Cornell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;25-1 Wisconsin, Minnesota Duluth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: Circa Sports&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scoring offense&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Team Avg. goals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michigan 4.53&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinnipiac 4.29&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penn State 3.87&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Dakota 3.84&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michigan State 3.83&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: NCAA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scoring defense&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Team Avg. goals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michigan State 1.97&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cornell 2.00&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Augustana 2.03&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinnipiac 2.15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dartmouth 2.18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: NCAA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scoring margin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Margin Team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.16 Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.15 Quinnipiac&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.87 Michigan State&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.59 North Dakota&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.43 Dartmouth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1.41 Western Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: NCAA&lt;/p&gt;",

Smoke could be seen rising from the capital. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the 86-year-old leader was in his offices at the time of the strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations,” Trump said in a video announcing “major combat operations” were underway. “For many years, you have asked for America’s help, but you never got it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed that sweeping goal. “Our joint operation will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their fate into their own hands,” Netanyahu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran responded as it had been threatening to do for months — first launching a wave of missiles and drones targeting Israel. It followed with strikes targeting U.S. military installations in Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar. The United Arab Emirates and Iraq shut down their airspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-ad0000\" name=\"module-ad0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;What we know so far:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-7d1491b0-14a7-11f1-a6a1-61d08433a9e0\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why the U.S. and Israel attacked:&lt;/b&gt; Tensions have soared in recent weeks as American warships moved into the region, and President Donald Trump said he wanted a deal to constrain Iran’s nuclear program. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the joint attack on the nation Israel considers its archenemy was to “remove an existential threat posed” by Iran.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trump’s statement: &lt;/b&gt;He indicated the U.S. was striking for reasons far beyond the nuclear program, listing grievances stretching back to the beginning of the Islamic Republic following a revolution in 1979 that turned Iran from one of America’s closest allies in the Middle East into a fierce foe. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-us-trump-address-f662a4f3378535d81197be699fb35a3e\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Read what he said in full.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Airspaces are closing:&lt;/b&gt; Iraq and the United Arab Emirates closed their airspace, and sirens sounded in Jordan. Bahrain said that a missile attack targeted the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet headquarters. Explosions also could be heard in Qatar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;World leaders fear broader escalation:&lt;/b&gt; The strikes create a dilemma for the United States’ democratic allies. While European leaders firmly oppose Iran’s nuclear program and crackdowns by its hard-line theocracy, they are loath to embrace unilateral military action by Trump that could breach international law and unleash a broader conflict.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Stunning new chapter for U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strikes opened a stunning new chapter in U.S. intervention in Iran and marked the second time in eight months that the Trump administration has used military force against the Islamic Republic. They also came weeks after Trump ordered a military operation to capture Venezuela’s president, Nicolás Maduro, and bring him and his wife to New York to face federal drug conspiracy charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operation also comes as tensions have soared in recent weeks as American warships moved into the region, and Trump said he wanted a deal to constrain Iran’s nuclear program at a moment when the country is struggling at home with growing dissent following nationwide protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran’s Foreign Ministry issued a defiant statement, saying that the country “will not hesitate” in its response. In a statement posted on X, the ministry said: “The time has come to defend the homeland and confront the enemy’s military assault.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forty people were reported killed at a girls’ school in southern Iran in the Israeli-U.S. strikes, according to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency. At least 45 others were wounded in the attack in Minab in Iran’s Hormozgan province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on reported strike on the school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four people were also killed by an Iranian missile striking a building in Syria’s southern city of Sweida, according to Syrian state television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-6e0000\" name=\"module-6e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-da0000\" name=\"image-da0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a64cba1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/90dd4ff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d930597/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"President Donald Trump explaining why the United States attacked Iran.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d930597/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d2fe59c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d930597/2147483647/strip/true/crop/860x483+0+41/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F25%2F89%2F78cef1d74d80b3a944e7e7837ff1%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-28-at-7-27-56-am.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump explaining why the United States attacked Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;AP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Trump said&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is President Donald Trump’s sttement on Iran in full:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A short time ago, the United States military began major combat operations in Iran. Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime. A vicious group of very hard, terrible people. Its menacing activities directly endanger the United States, our troops, our bases overseas, and our allies throughout the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For 47 years, the Iranian regime has chanted Death to America and waged an unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder, targeting the United States, our troops and the innocent people in many, many countries. Among the regime’s very first acts was to back a violent takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, holding dozens of American hostages for 444 days. In 1983, Iran’s proxies carried out the marine barracks bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American military personnel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2000, they knew and were probably involved with the attack on the USS Cole. Many died. Iranian forces killed and maimed hundreds of American service members in Iraq. The regime’s proxies have continued to launch countless attacks against American forces stationed in the Middle East in recent years, as well as U.S. naval and commercial vessels and international shipping lines. It’s been mass terror, and we’re not going to put up with it any longer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From Lebanon to Yemen and Syria to Iraq, the regime has armed, trained and funded terrorist militias that have soaked the earth with blood and guts. And it was Iran’s proxy, Hamas, that launched the monstrous Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, slaughtering more than 1,000 innocent people, including 46 Americans, while taking 12 of our citizens hostage. It was brutal, something like the world has never seen before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They’ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore. Instead, they attempted to rebuild their nuclear program and to continue developing the long range missiles that can now threaten our very good friends and allies in Europe, our troops stationed overseas, and could soon reach the American homeland. Just imagine how emboldened this regime would be if they ever had, and actually were armed with nuclear weapons as a means to deliver their message.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For these reasons, the United States military is undertaking a massive and ongoing operation to prevent this very wicked, radical dictatorship from threatening America and our core national security interests. We’re going to destroy their missiles and raze their missile industry to the ground. It will be totally again obliterated. We’re going to annihilate their navy. We’re going to ensure that the region’s terrorist proxies can no longer destabilize the region or the world and attack our forces, and no longer use their IEDs, or roadside bombs as they are sometimes called, to so gravely wound and kill thousands and thousands of people, including many Americans. And we will ensure that Iran does not obtain a nuclear weapon. It’s a very simple message. They will never have a nuclear weapon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This regime will soon learn that no one should challenge the strength and might of the United States Armed Forces. I built and rebuilt our military in my first administration and there is no military on earth even close to its power, strength or sophistication. My administration is taking every possible step to minimize the risk to U.S. personnel in the region. Even so, and I do not make this statement lightly, the Iranian regime seeks to kill. The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost, and we may have casualties. That often happens in war. But we’re doing this not for now. We’re doing this for the future. And it is a noble mission. We pray for every service member as they selflessly risk their lives to ensure that Americans and our children will never be threatened by a nuclear-armed Iran. We ask God to protect all of our heroes in harm’s way. And we trust that with his help, the men and women of the armed forces will prevail. We have the greatest in the world, and they will prevail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the armed forces and all of the police, I say tonight that you must lay down your weapons and have complete immunity. Or in the alternative, face certain death. So, lay down your arms. You will be treated fairly with total immunity, or you will face certain death. Finally, to the great proud people of Iran, I say tonight that the hour of your freedom is at hand. Stay sheltered. Don’t leave your home. It’s very dangerous outside. Bombs will be dropping everywhere. When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For many years, you have asked for America’s help. But you never got it. No president was willing to do what I am willing to do tonight. Now you have a president who is giving you what you want. So let’s see how you respond. America is backing you with overwhelming strength and devastating force. Now is the time to seize control of your destiny, and to unleash the prosperous and glorious future that is close within your reach. This is the moment for action. Do not let it pass.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;May God bless the brave men and women of America’s armed forces. May God bless the United States of America. May God bless you all. Thank you.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Attack was coordinated between Israel and U.S.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacks came after weeks of the U.S. military massing forces in the region even as U.S. and Iranian envoys held talks in Switzerland and Oman aimed at finding a diplomatic solution to head off American military operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, a key mediator in the U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, said in a post on X that he was dismayed that the United States and Israel moved forward with the operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Active and serious negotiations have yet again been undermined,” said al-Busaidi, who traveled to Washington on Friday to meet with Vice President JD Vance for talks. “Neither the interests of the United States nor the cause of global peace are well served by this. And I pray for the innocents who will suffer. I urge the United States not to get sucked in further.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel said the operation was carried out as a “broad, coordinated, and joint operation against the regime” that has been planned for months between the Israeli and U.S. militaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, in justifying the military action, claimed that Iran has continued to develop its nuclear program and plans to develop missiles to reach the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also acknowledged that there could be American casualties, saying “that often happens in war.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a notable call on Americans to brace themselves from a U.S. leader who swept into office on an “America First” platform and vowed to keep out of “forever wars” that had bogged down his recent predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump’s statement indicated the U.S. was striking for reasons far beyond the nuclear program, listing grievances stretching back to the beginning of the Islamic Republic following a revolution in 1979 that turned Iran from one of America’s closest allies in the Middle East into a fierce foe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. president said he was aiming to “annihilate” the Iranian navy and destroy regional proxies supported by Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also called on the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to lay down its arms, pledging that members would be given immunity, while warning they would face “certain death” if they didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’ve rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can’t take it anymore,” Trump said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump had threatened military action — but held off — following Iran’s recent crackdown on protests spurred by economic grievances and evolved into a nationwide, anti-government push against the ruling clerics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Human Rights Activists News Agency says it confirmed more than 7,000 deaths in the crackdown and that it is investigating thousands more. The government has acknowledged more than 3,000 killed, though it has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran has said it hasn’t enriched since June, but it has blocked international inspectors from visiting the sites America bombed during a 12-day war then. Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press have shown new activity at two of those sites, suggesting Iran is trying to assess and potentially recover material there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran has a self-imposed limit on its ballistic missile program, limiting their range to 1,240 miles. That puts all the Mideast and some of Eastern Europe in their range. There is no public evidence of Iran seeking to have intercontinental ballistic missiles, though Washington has criticized its space program as potentially allowing it to one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran had hoped to avert a war, but maintains it has the right to enrich uranium and does not want to discuss other issues, like its long-range missile program or support for armed groups like Hamas and Hezbollah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strikes could also have a huge impact on global markets, particularly if Iran is able to make the Strait of Hormuz unsafe for commercial traffic. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil passed through the strait in 2025, about a third of total worldwide oil exports transported by sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Strikes hit targets across Iran&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iranian media reported strikes nationwide. Roads to Khamenei’s compound in downtown Tehran had been shut down by authorities as other blasts rang out across the capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khamenei has not made a public appearance in recent days and wasn’t immediately seen after. During the 12-day war in June, he was believed to have been taken to a secure location away from his Tehran compound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tehran, witnesses heard the first blast by Khamenei’s office. Iranian state television later reported on the explosion, without offering a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More explosions struck Iran’s capital after Israel said it was attacking the country. Authorities have offered no casualty information from the strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targets in the Israeli campaign included Iran’s military, symbols of government and intelligence targets, according to an official briefed on the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic information on the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Iran retaliates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours after the strikes, Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said it launched a “first wave” of drones and missiles targeting Israel, where a nationwide warning was issued as the military said it was working to intercept incoming Iranian missiles. There was no immediate word on any damage or casualties from the ongoing attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Bahrain said that a missile attack targeted the U.S. Navy’s 5th Fleet headquarters in the island kingdom. Witnesses heard sirens and explosions in Kuwait, home to U.S. Army Central. Explosions also could be heard in Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraq and the United Arab Emirates closed their airspace, and sirens sounded in Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials also reported a drone strike hit a headquarters of the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia in Iraq, killing two people and wounding three Saturday. The group had earlier threatened to enter the fray should Iran come under attack. An Israeli military official said Israel was not aware of any Israeli strikes on Kataib Hezbollah headquarters in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, meanwhile, vowed to resume attacks on Red Sea shipping routes and on Israel, according to two senior Houthi officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no official announcement from the Houthi leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. embassies or consulates in Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Israel posted on social media that they told staffers to shelter in place and recommended all Americans “do the same until further notice.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

He expects to have another conversation closer to the deadline next Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"[We discussed] the state of where we're at and what my thoughts were, what his thoughts were,\" Foligno said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There's just a lot of unknowns, right? When you're in this situation where you're not in the playoffs, there's decisions that the organization has to make, and therefore there's decisions you have to make. That's something we're just going to go through the process of. It's too early to say.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foligno's contract doesn't give him control over his fate, but his status in the organization functionally does. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting his two primary former teams, the Blue Jackets and Bruins, are both in the playoff race in the Eastern Conference — and his family would be familiar with both of those cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/02/21/blackhawks-nhl-trade-deadline-preview-connor-murphy-jason-dickinson-ilya-mikheyev\"   &gt;Blackhawks trade-deadline preview: Connor Murphy, Jason Dickinson, other veterans might be moved out&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mikheyev’s status&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contract-extension talks between the Hawks and Ilya Mikheyev have been tabled, increasing Mikheyev's availability on the trade market, Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman reported Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mikheyev deflected questions about the situation Friday, claiming he doesn't \"think about contract or trade.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks probably don't want to give Mikheyev, a 31-year-old pending free agent, a new contract longer than two years, although they're probably willing to be generous with the salary-cap hit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mikheyev might be seeking a longer-term deal, knowing this is his last opportunity to do so. He made an interesting impromptu comment about how \"you're not going to play hockey until 45 or something.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman also discussed Friday an emerging surplus of sellers compared to buyers around the league right now. That could hurt Davidson's odds of finding contenders willing to take —&amp;nbsp;and meet his asking prices for —&amp;nbsp;players like Mikheyev, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/02/26/blackhawks-connor-murphy-nhl-trade-deadline-rumors-playoffs-allure\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Connor Murphy&lt;/a&gt; and Jason Dickinson.&lt;/p&gt;",

They plan on engaging with him on contract talks in the coming days. Despite being 32, he could fetch a two-year deal around $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Byard said he’ll consider his family obligations, he wants to keep playing for a winning team. He has ties to Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel, who coached him in Tennessee, and could consider rejoining him. Still, his success in Chicago — and the fact general manager Ryan Poles has lobbied publicly for his return —&amp;nbsp;is a good sign he stays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If he doesn’t, the Bears have a complete rebuild to do at the position. Jaquan Brisker is likely to get a more lucrative deal elsewhere, and backups Jonathan Owens and Elijah Hicks are pending free agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2017, the Bears sent out a smokescreen — even to their own head coach, John Fox&amp;nbsp;— that they were interested in drafting safety Jamal Adams. Instead, they traded up to draft quarterback Mitch Trubisky.The Bears took Brisker with the 48&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; pick in 2022, the highest they’d picked a safety since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many in the league consider safety a fungible position — one that teams can fill on the third day of the draft and in the second wave of free agency. That’s probably true at one starting safety spot, but not both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s draft, though, puts a higher premium on the position than some recent ones. Downs is considered a top-10 prospect — and maybe the player with the highest floor, regardless of position. ESPN has Round 1 grades on two other safeties —&amp;nbsp;Oregon’s Dillon Thieneman and Toledo’s Emmanuel McNeil-Warren are ranked 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; overall, respectively, by ESPN. Only six safeties ran the 40-yard dash faster than Thieneman, who transferred from Purdue to Oregon to, he said, improve his draft stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really focused on where I wasn't good at, and then was able to expand my game play and play multiple coverages over there,” he said. “Oregon and prepare for the next level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emmanuel-Warren, who profiles as an enforcer, ran just a 4.52-second 40-yard dash. Downs didn’t do on-field work at the Combine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no doubt in Downs’ mind where he stands, even at an undervalued position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's not really positional value — it's, ‘Who affects the game?’” he said. “If you affect the game in a lot of ways, that's what's most important. So that's really all I can worry about honestly. I can't worry about what anybody else says or what the coaches have done. …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My film is what it is, and they can make a decision based off of that.”&lt;/p&gt;",

He missed the first two regular season games in Japan but rebounded to become the Cubs’ most dependable player while collecting a career-best 178 hits in addition to a .297 batting average and a second Gold Glove Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His .371 batting average with 51 RBIs with runners in scoring position helped offset an offense that struck out and stagnated frequently in the second half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade speculation resurfaced after the Cubs signed prized free agent Alex Bregman (with the assumption Matt Shaw would move from third to second base), but Hoerner remains a vital part of the Cubs at second base with Shaw serving as a super utility player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Dansby Swanson was unavailable to play, manager Craig Counsell said Hoerner would take over at shortstop, “and that’s certainly important. Part of Nico’s value is that should something happen, you would be able to move him over there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping Hoerner this winter while signing Bregman and acquiring Edward Cabrera reinforced the Cubs’ commitment to pushing well past the second round of the National League playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last year was very significant towards the ultimate goal of winning World Series,” Hoerner said. “I think you know when you're in the middle of it and you're fresh off of losing, all the talk of progress and all that can be a little frustrating, because all you have is the season that you're in the middle of.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But taking the step back in the offseason, I think there was a lot of positive to build off of from last season, and I think we're an improved group now that now is set to have a very strong season.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoerner made his major league debut in September of 2019, when the Cubs were in the midst of a slide that knocked them out of playoff contention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Hoerner has a better understanding of what’s at stake, especially after experiencing the collective disappointment of falling to the rival Brewers in the NL Division Series last October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think in order to really appreciate the playoff chase, and obviously playoff baseball, part of what makes it so special is the course of the whole season and the arc of the different storylines of the year, and obviously being close with guys,” said Hoerner, who is in the final year of a three-year, $35 million contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So when you get called up at the end of the year there's definitely not the awareness of that. it was very obvious immediately, just the passion that Cubs fans have and how much it means to them, and that side of it has always been very clear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"cf wS\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\" id=\"rte-10387ef0-14ff-11f1-8a06-a7697a0d1dfa\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" class=\"amq\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px 16px; vertical-align: top; width: 44px; visibility: hidden;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" class=\"amr\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; width: 728.667px;\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;",

You can toss the development of top pitching prospects Hagen Smith, another first-round left-hander; and righties Tanner McDougal and Grant Taylor into that snapshot of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schultz hit a speed bump last season when right patellar tendinitis set in his right knee, adversely affecting mechanics and causing him to miss time the last three months of the season. In five starts over 16 ⅓ innings following a promotion to Triple-A Charlotte, he walked nine batters and posted a 9.37 ERA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over two innings of one run ball against the Brewers, Schultz struck out three and walked no one. While showing a changeup he hopes to feature with his upper-90s fastball and slider, he touched 97 mph knowing there’s a little more in the tank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s spring, everyone is building up,” Schultz said. “You always want to throw harder, but there are things more important than just pure velocity. After last year with the ups and downs and stuff, there’s a lot of things I’m working on and every week, go out there and show it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The knee “feels good,” Schultz said, which was probably the most important thing to come out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Getting in a routine of doing stuff as we’re ramping up, facing hitters and into games,” Schultz said. “Feel good about it, and I’m excited for the year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Role model&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right-hander Mike Vasil, who pitched 101 innings over 47 appearances last season, wants to start but his value as a multi-innings reliever is significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s huge,” Venable said. “Our ability to utilize that last year was awesome. We had him pitch in every single role. He was starting the games, in the middle of games and at the end of games.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vasil pitched three innings in his second outing Friday against the Rangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That versatility really helps us out,” Venable said, “especially as you get going in the season and guys need rest and you have injuries that put constraints on you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rest assured&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Benintendi was out a second straight day and could miss a couple more but gave assurances that his sore right side is not worrisome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not at all,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At this point in the spring we just want to be cautious,” Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOX 7, GUARDIANS 5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On his last day before leaving to play for Team Italy in the World Baseball Classic, Sam Antonacci DH’d and homered in the first inning against Tanner Bibee. Antonacci also homered against the Cubs’ Jameson Taillon, his circuit clouts traveling 416 and 417 feet, and scored two more runs after getting hit by pitches. An infielder, Antonacci was hit 39 times in the minors and the Arizona Fall League last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• All-Star righty Shane Smith allowed one run on two hits and a walk over three innings, completing the outing by throwing a slider past Jose Ramirez for his second strikeout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smith said he “felt the rhythm was a little better in the delivery” than it was in his first start. “Was able to land some offspeed for strikes early on. Just located the fastball a lot better than last time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Miguel Vargas was 2-for-3 including an RBI single. The third baseman is 6-for-14 (.429) this spring.

Snow lifted him out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snow’s rescue mission brought instant fame to young Darren, who says he really doesn’t remember the incident. His child-like, overzealous ambition in that moment had much to do with the object of his pursuit: the bat belonged to Kenny Lofton, his favorite player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To me it never happened unless I see it on TV,” Baker said. “It’s funny. I was a little kid and got too excited, man. I just jumped the gun.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be jumping the gun to say where Baker, now 27 with a 7-for-14 including two doubles in nine games with Washington in 2024 on his major league resume, will fit in this season. The Nationals released Baker in December after he hit .256/.343/.318 while playing second base and left field for Triple-A Rochester, and he signed a minor league deal with the rebuilding Sox on Feb. 14. Baker is in minor league camp, likely competing for a job at Triple-A Charlotte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker appeared in his fourth Cactus League game Saturday, playing second base against the Guardians. He started a double play with a backhand flip to shortstop, reached on an infield single and stole second and third, the latter on catcher Kody Huff's return throw to pitcher Kolby Allard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everybody has been welcoming. I love it here,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m just stacking days right now, just getting better each day,” Baker said. “I don’t look too far into the future, just trying to make it through spring training and go from there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now with the organization on the South Side of town, the North Side was home to Baker from ages 4 to 8 while Dusty was managing the Cubs from 2003-07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I played my first Little League at Welles Park [in Lincoln Square] and we still have lifelong friends I made there. And my mom loves Chicago, she wants to go on every road trip there. It’s a big part of my family.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker followed his dad’s baseball path, played high school ball under the microscope 10 minutes where his dad starred, played at Cal Berkeley and was drafted by the Nationals in the 10th round in 2021. He’s a career .280/.347/.347 hitter with seven homers and 102 stolen bases in the minors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His versatility will help his chances of landing a job at Charlotte. And he says the intangibles he brings should, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do a lot of little things; I feel like I’m a winning player,” said Baker, who is 3-for-4 with a walk this spring. “I’ve been around the game at a high level where I know what it’s supposed to look like. I haven’t played forever, but I’ve at least watched or seen or spoke about a lot of the game. Nothing really surprises me, and I feel like the more you watch me play you’ll notice different little things that help the team win.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker talks often with his dad, but not always about baseball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My dad has taught me about life, about maturing and becoming a man,” he said. “Whatever wisdom he has for me, I’m all ears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My dad is very generous. He can meet you for the first time and make you feel like you’ve been friends for life. He has a pure heart and he sees the best in everybody. That’s something I want to take with me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=\"cf wS\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\" id=\"rte-cfa0ba40-14fb-11f1-845b-83d1b8ab8ab5\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" class=\"amq\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px 16px; vertical-align: top; width: 44px; visibility: hidden;\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\" class=\"amr\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; width: 728.667px;\"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Rhodes, son of wrestling legend Dusty Rhodes, has been atop the totem pole since WrestleMania 40, when he beat Roman Reigns to win his first WWE Universal championship. For Rhodes, it was the ending to a years-long journey to prove to himself and the company that he could be a top guy after leaving in 2016 and triumphantly returning in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after vanquishing Reigns and winning the championship, the work had just begun. He would be the guy sitting down for interviews to promote WWE, while also having to perform in the ring. But Rhodes loves everything that comes with being on top, even if it’s not all he expected it to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had a lifetime to prepare for being the quarterback, but it doesn't prepare you for it,” Rhodes told the Sun-Times. “It's a little lonely [at the top].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rhodes said he’s leaned on director of talent relations Zach Maxwell, makeup artist Kristen Bachino and social media producer Matty Cox as he was in his “pursuit of greatness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wanted people to tell me what we needed to do, to tell me what was good, what was bad and field test things,” Rhodes said. “[I wanted people] to be together as we go into this new era of WWE .”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WWE, from a business standpoint, has had a fruitful past couple of years. In 2025, ESPN, according to the Wall Street Journal, signed a five-year, $1.6-billion contract with WWE to stream its premium live events across its platforms. That same year, WWE also agreed to a multiyear agreement with Netflix to host its flagship show, “Monday Night Raw,” and the WWE library of past premium live events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those deals have thrust WWE into the mainstream, and Rhodes is the face of it. Rhodes wants to help WWE reach new audiences. WWE holding the Elimination Chamber at the United Center — the company usually holds its events at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont — is another step toward showcasing the talent to a large audience. Keeping with his sports metaphors, Rhodes is excited for wrestling fans to see the talented newcomers on the main roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people, I think you will be surprised that we have loaded the crew up with freshmen on the varsity team,” Rhodes said. “Oba Femi, Trick Williams and Jevon Evans, for example. Kit Wilson is also one out there pounding the pavement. If you're a fan or if you just like wrestling, you're looking forward to decades of good wrestling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the new talent breaks in, the old guard isn’t ready to relinquish their high standing. WWE World Heavyweight Champion and Chicago native CM Punk has given no indication of retirement. Rhodes is still in the midst of his main-event run. In fact, he’s started to find himself that most good guys find themselves in WWE, in which they receive mixed reactions from the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Rhodes has a history with Chicago. He — along with wrestlers Kenny Omega, and Matt and Nick Jackson — self-funded a pay-per-view at the NOW Arena that sold out within 30 minutes of tickets being on sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, Rhodes also wrestled a PLE match against Seth Rollins with a torn pec. Despite his history with Chicago, Rhodes said he expects this to be an “away game.” He refers to the jeers he hears from the crowd as “noise.” He was heavily booed in Germany this past January. Regardless of his crowd reaction, Rhodes can take a big-picture view. He's focused on delivering a great show to ensure WWE can return to the United Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fans are the most fun, unpredictable, chaotic and passionate bunch,” Rhodes said. “ I think you have to lean into their chaos a little. You can't try to be smarter than them. “In Germany, I heard for the first time, the ‘Let's go Cody, Cody sucks’ [chant], and I just couldn't believe it. I forgot where I was standing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But you never know in terms of the breakdown of the crowd. But I'm good with whatever they're gonna bring, because I know Chicago knows this is a special one. If you don't deliver when you're on the field, then [the fans] don't come back. You don't get to run the United Center. The building is smaller and smaller, but I think everyone delivers at Elimination Chamber.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

Buyers can qualify for up to $100,000 in down payment assistance, along with an additional $50,000 in support from the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want families to know that buying a home is feasible,” Carretero said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carretero said The Resurrection Project is currently working with about 300 families to prepare them for homeownership. Most of the participants are working-class families who are in the process of becoming eligible to purchase a home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the buyers will also be first-time homeowners and it could be the first step to building generational wealth for their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-b60000\" name=\"image-b60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b8c2112/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2F1c%2Fccd28c1f4009820ab4e128669f1b%2Fbotyhousing-260228-11.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9730ed6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2F1c%2Fccd28c1f4009820ab4e128669f1b%2Fbotyhousing-260228-11.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/509bc6f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2F1c%2Fccd28c1f4009820ab4e128669f1b%2Fbotyhousing-260228-11.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"BOTYHOUSING_260228-11.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/509bc6f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2F1c%2Fccd28c1f4009820ab4e128669f1b%2Fbotyhousing-260228-11.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8ff3deb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2F1c%2Fccd28c1f4009820ab4e128669f1b%2Fbotyhousing-260228-11.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/509bc6f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2F1c%2Fccd28c1f4009820ab4e128669f1b%2Fbotyhousing-260228-11.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visitors on Saturday check out the new houses erected in Back of the Yards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giacomo Cain/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By purchasing one of these homes, families “have chosen not just to buy a piece of property, but [they're] buying part of the community,” said Raul Raymundo, CEO of The Resurrection Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They're not only going to contribute to their neighborhood, but to the city as a whole, because now they own a piece of the city,” Raymundo added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Homes are also being built in &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2024/11/28/city-backed-plan-reclaiming-chicago-vacant-lots-homes-results-south-west-sides\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;North Lawndale&lt;/a&gt;, Roseland, Washington Park and Chicago Lawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By converting these vacant lots into new homes, we are not only making use of unused land, but we are making neighborhoods safer,” Mayor Brandon Johnson said at the ceremony. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are ... expanding opportunities for affordable home ownership.

That vaulted an issue they hoped was resolved to the top of their offseason priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important enough that they could use the No. 25 overall pick to address it. There’s no way coach Ben Johnson wants a repeat of the Bears’ carousel at the position last season, when a four-way competition dragged deep into training camp and two players were benched before Trapilo stepped in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Trapilo expected to miss at least most of the upcoming season, the Bears’ options are to find a stopgap solution and hope Trapilo fully recovers and continues the trajectory he was on, or they can look for a more permanent answer and allow competition to sort it out over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General manager Ryan Poles left all options open at the NFL Scouting Combine other than tinkering with the other four starting spots. Left guard Joe Thuney, who moved to left tackle for the divisional round playoff game, is staying put, as is ascending right tackle Darnell Wright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears could re-sign Braxton Jones cheaply, bet on Theo Benedet’s development or hope it all comes together for Kiran Amegadjie in his third season, but those choices are dicey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is that player in the building?” offensive line coach Dan Roushar said on former lineman Terron Armstead’s podcast, The Set. “There’s guys that have traits, but not consistent enough... So that’s to be determined.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roushar went on to point out that premium positions like left tackle usually require teams to use premium resources and finding a good enough player there requires “draft capital, or an asset we currently don’t have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The options tend to be iffy at No. 25, and when the Bears waited until the second round to choose Trapilo at No. 56 overall last year, he was eighth among offensive tackles. The top four or five tackles typically are gone by the 25th pick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upside for the Bears is that the rest of their offensive line is excellent and experienced, with each of the other four starters going into at least his fourth season. Thuney won the Protector of the Year as the league’s top offensive lineman, center Drew Dalman made the Pro Bowl, right guard Jonah Jackson is a former Pro Bowl selection and Wright was second-team All-Pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That would be amazing,” Utah tackle Caleb Lomu said of the prospect of joining a veteran unit. “I love the learning that it brings as a young player. I want to learn as much as I can and adapt to the culture of the offensive line. Having an offensive line room that already has structure would help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lomu is among the possibilities that seem realistic for the Bears at No. 25 at the moment, though Poles noted that, “Sometimes there are years where there’s a run, where they’re all gone,” and sometimes, “There’s a lot of them [and] there are a couple of guys who are sitting there waiting for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgia’s Monroe Freeling, Alabama’s Kadyn Proctor, Clemson’s Blake Miller and Lomu all are projected to be reasonably in range for the Bears. If they wait until the second round, when they hold the No. 57 overall selection, they could be looking at Arizona State’s Max Iheanachor or Northwestern’s Caleb Tiernan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears will take a good look at free agency first, and 49ers 12-time Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams is expected to be available, but they’re unlikely to have the salary-cap space to pursue a top player. If they believe there are enough quality left tackles in the draft, their best move probably is to look for one there. If that pick works out and Trapilo bounces back, there’s nothing wrong with having a surplus at such a valuable spot.&lt;/p&gt;",

The likes of Dylan Harper (No. 2), VJ Edgecombe (No. 3), Cedric Coward (No. 11), and Derik Queen (No. 13) have each flashed star potential. While Ace Bailey (No. 5), Tre Johnson (No. 6), Jeremiah Fears (No. 7), Egor Demin (No. 8), Collin Murray-Boyles (No. 9) and Carter Bryant (No. 14) are showing that they can at least be key pieces – as starters or in the rotation – on a playoff-caliber team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one somewhat of a disappointment? Suns big man Khaman Maluach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selected No. 10, the center out of Duke was expected to be raw and a work in progress, and for a Phoenix team sitting No. 7 in the Western Conference standings and fighting for a playoff spot, babysitting and development is not a high priority this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean they are out on Maluach by any means. Call it more of a one-year pause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there’s the Bulls. The one front office that did miss with the selection of Noa Essengue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not even that they knowingly went after a player they knew was a project or the fact that Essengue unfortunately had to have season-ending shoulder surgery after just two brief appearances and six minutes of NBA basketball. There is recent opinion coming out of the organization that once they got Essengue into fall camp there was a realization that he was going to need two to three years of work – on and off the court – before even being a serious rotation player. And that was pre-injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A loaded draft class and this is what the Bulls took from it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only good news is executive vice president of basketball operations Arturas Karnisovas and general manager Marc Eversley are headed for possible redemption, as the Bulls sink future in the standings in this current 11-game losing streak and higher in the draft lottery odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while there is always hope that they can land in the top four picks – that sits at 20.3% as of Saturday – their more likely odds (50.7%) are staying at No. 9. What does that mean if they stick to a current mock script and opt not to try and pretend to be the two smartest execs in the room?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talent incoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nate Ament – Tennessee – 6-10 – Forward&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Cameron Boozer and Caleb Wilson would be instant additions to the Bulls frontcourt and allow Matas Buzelis to get more playing time in his natural spot as a three, Ament is the consolation prize for slipping out of the top four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The athletic wing started the year off slowly under high expectations but has really flashed since the start of February. Ament will have the opportunity to make an even bigger statement in March for the Vols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keaton Wagler – Illinois – 6-6 – Guard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think poor-man’s Knueppel, as Wagler is proving to be lethal from three-point range, play with a high IQ, and jumping up the draft boards like Knueppel did at about this same time last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a good chance that he can have a hot March, leapfrogging the likes of Darius Acuff Jr. and Mikel Brown Jr., moving out of reach for the Bulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Karim Lopez – New Zealand Breakers – 6-9 – Forward&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be a mistake to grab Lopez in the top 10, but since when does Karnisovas care about mistakes. He’s reached before and an 18-year-old playing professionally overseas is right in his wheelhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Bulls can land the protected lottery pick from Portland, Lopez would seem to be a better gamble in that zip code and for a team with two first-round picks.&lt;/p&gt;",
