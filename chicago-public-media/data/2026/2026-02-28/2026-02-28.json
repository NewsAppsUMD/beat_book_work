Lockport is one of those places. And younger fans may not realize that at its heart, Lockport is a basketball city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s probably one of the reasons two grown men ripped off their shirts and celebrated wildly on the court shortly after the host Porters knocked off rival Joliet West 58-30 on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/27/chicago-high-school-basketball-scores-illinois-ihsa-playoffs\"   &gt;Friday&lt;/a&gt; to win their first regional championship since 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We just wanted it more,” Lockport junior Nedas Venckus said. “We came out ready to die on the court. We had to win.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Porters (27-5) had not even played in a regional title game for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was reminded a few times of the drought,” Lockport coach Dave Wilson said. “It was a goal of ours as a program. I’ve had a brilliant coaching staff and the kids bought in from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lockport is really good at a lot of sports, and they achieve at a high level. We talk about it as a basketball program. We watch football making runs in the state playoffs. We watch volleyball go down state. Softball, baseball. It is a challenge to keep up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson is in his third year at Lockport, and his team was at home and favored to win, but Joliet West (21-11) played very well against some of the best teams in the area over the final month of the regular season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tigers’ plan was physical man defense on Lockport’s star juniors, twins Nedas and Nojus Venckus. It worked very well for one quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the first quarter we could not move,” Wilson said. “So, we had to modify and adapt. The twins beat up on each other every day. There is nothing like brotherly physicality, brotherly love. Every day since they were two years old, they are beating each other up and it prepares them for a moment like this. They were able to weather the storm.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Porters brought the storm in the second quarter, limiting Joliet West to just one free throw. Lockport took total control of the game with a 22-0 and held the Tiger without a field goal for a 14:16 stretch that spanned from midway through the first quarter into the start of the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-110000\" name=\"image-110000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/43fe19f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2Ffc%2Fdb5ac43b47dfa45f66d239c16c91%2Fob-cst-022826-7008.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b1a9e95/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2Ffc%2Fdb5ac43b47dfa45f66d239c16c91%2Fob-cst-022826-7008.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e0f72e3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2Ffc%2Fdb5ac43b47dfa45f66d239c16c91%2Fob-cst-022826-7008.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Lockport&amp;#x27;s Nedas Venckus drives toward the basket during the Porters&amp;#x27; 58-30 win against Joliet West.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e0f72e3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2Ffc%2Fdb5ac43b47dfa45f66d239c16c91%2Fob-cst-022826-7008.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bb57e7f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2Ffc%2Fdb5ac43b47dfa45f66d239c16c91%2Fob-cst-022826-7008.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e0f72e3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd8%2Ffc%2Fdb5ac43b47dfa45f66d239c16c91%2Fob-cst-022826-7008.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lockport’s Nedas Venckus drives toward the basket during the Porters’ 58-30 win against Joliet West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before the game started coach said intensity is our competitive advantage,” Nojus Venckus said. “And straight from the jump we knew we had to be more intense, more aggressive than them. We tried to slow down because they are a fast team. You saw what happened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nedas Venckus finished with 15 points and five rebounds and Nojus added 14 points. Senior Trace Schaaf scored seven and point guard Nathan Munson added seven points and six assists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the Lockport adults were focused on the 15-year drought, but the players weren’t even aware of it until they snapped it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We did not know before the game, but it feels great to be a part of history now,” Munson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joshua Calvert led Joliet West with eight points. Brockton Goehrke and Aamir Shannon each scored six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why you can’t expect things,” Tigers coach Jeremy Kreiger said. “You have to go earn them. We didn’t earn it. [Lockport] has played well all year, and they earned the right to cut their nets down on the home court. That is something those kids will never forget.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Porters will face Rich in the Class 4A Joliet West sectional semifinals on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Lockport dominates Joliet West 54-30 and celebrates its first regional title since 2011. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spoke to many long suffering Porters fans on the way out.

During the altercation, prosecutors said Alexander removed his bullet proof vest and threw it to the ground.

The victim's firearm was holstered at the time of the argument and the shooting. The defendant fled the scene and came into contact with another co-worker, whom he told that he had just shot Alexander.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander was then taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he was pronounced dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin was arrested by authorities three blocks from his home approximately 20 minutes after the shooting, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin was detained and will appear in court again on March 17, authorities said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;",

He offered to let the feds argue for a “reasonable”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;extension of time,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also told them,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“there’s no need to hold them until March 5 if they can be released more quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/04/chicago-trump-immigration-deportation-ice-raid-south-shore-midway-blitz\"   &gt;Building owner OK’d Trump administration’s raid of Chicago apartment complex, court records show&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The judge said he’s still considering how to rule in the cases of five additional people, meaning his final written order could apply to as many as 37 individuals. He ruled from the bench Friday during a hearing at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cummings said the individuals should be released “on their own recognizance, without conditions and without bond.” He considered the circumstances of roughly 50 people, following recent guidance and restrictions handed down by a federal appeals court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge found that many of the people now set for release were arrested without a warrant, and that agents lacked probable cause to believe they would escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling revolves around the so-called Castanon Nava settlement agreement. It restricts the ability of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, and anyone working with them, to make warrantless arrests in Illinois and nearby states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Fleming, the associate director of federal litigation for the National Immigrant Justice Center who represents plaintiffs in the case, said “our singular goal right now is to get as many people out, where there were violations, as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We sense an urgency because people have been stuck, unlawfully, in detention for months now,” Fleming told reporters after court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/01/massive-immigration-raid-on-chicago-apartment-building-leaves-residents-reeling-i-feel-defeated\"   &gt;Massive immigration raid on Chicago apartment building leaves residents reeling: ‘I feel defeated’&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one of the 32 have already either been released or deported, Fleming later told the Chicago Sun-Times.

It’s called ‘‘positioning.’’ What NBA teams are being accused of doing and being heavily fined for — so far, commissioner Adam Silver has hit the Jazz and the Pacers with $500K and $100K fines, respectively — is not at all the same as what tanking has been accused of being in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is some new at-the-quarter-century break different-‘‘ish.’’ In ‘‘tanking,’’ you lose with intent. In ‘‘positioning,’’ the game within the game being played in the NBA, you simply don’t win with a plan. The difference is similar to reading this column and saying it’s not an ‘‘opinion,’’ it’s a ‘‘perspective.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at the core of it all — the crime of tanking, the art of positioning — coming in late June is an incoming rookie class predicted to be one the NBA has never seen before. Which has created this problem the NBA has never seen before. One the New York Times’ The Pulse asked (quasi-rightfully claimed!) if it’s ‘‘the best freshman class ever.’’ An answer just by sheer volume of the number of freshmen who are currently the best players in the NCAA is a resounding ‘‘Duh,’’ attached to the 99.9998% belief that most, if not all, who made The Athletic’s essential newsletter pose that extremely rhetorical question, ‘‘Are going to be in this year’s NBA Draft?’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mikel Brown Jr. (Louisville). Darryn Peterson (Kansas). AJ Dybantsa (BYU). Cameron Boozer (Duke). Caleb Wilson (UNC). Tounde Yessoufou (Baylor). Kingston Flemings (Houston). Keaton Wagler (Illinois). Darius Acuff (Arkansas). Brayden Burries (Arizona). Nate Ament (Tennessee). All are on something extra. All will be exactly what a specific team needs when it drafts him. The teams just have to be in the right position to get which player they want and would have still drafted had they had a higher-positioned pick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, there is a strong possibility that of the top 12 or 15 picks in this NBA Draft, 10 or 12 could be players who just finished their freshman seasons. All (with the exception of Burries) currently younger than 20 years old. Teams doing what has to be done to get first NBA dibs on one and signed to a rookie contract is called ‘‘vying for position,’’ not tanking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See, tanking is gambling. What’s going on with teams losing right now to get one of these prodigies on their roster is leveraging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, this is about oversized-team-logo-card superiority. To get the top lottery pick or one of the top three lottery picks for the one or two generational players whose name former commissioner David Stern or current commish Silver would call first on draft night. But this time, every team that doesn’t make the play-in (this most definitely includes the Bulls, even as they unintentionally lose by default) wants to be in the best possible position to get one of the top eight, 10 or 12 players who could realistically be its version of franchise-changing. Whom that player is this year makes no difference. That’s the difference. They are all so close in skill level, skill sets, talent and promise that ‘‘generational’’ might reasonably apply to the first 10 picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So saying tanking is ‘‘rampant’’ and has been ‘‘worse this year than we’ve seen in recent memory,’’ as Silver did, or calling teams that seem to want to lose ‘‘tankers’’ or screaming, ‘‘Abolish the lottery,’’ in news headlines as if it were the new Jim Crow is not in any sense adequate. And trying to end or find a remedy for or fix it won’t work because the chances of having another draft class this dope and deep be available won’t happen again until the league announces it’s NBA100 team. Everyone’s diagnosis is wrong, so any solution to correct it is going to be wronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all of the anti-tanking cries and campaigns to de-emphasize losing — all concerns that will have their day in court during NBA meetings in the offseason — there’s a quiet hope that overzealousness and overreach don’t cloud the changes that will be enforced. With hope the league brain trust will realize how unicorns existed this year in college basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, let’s hope the NBA keeps in mind that, when it comes to crime — even to those who happen to look at losing games to make their teams better as the sports version of a criminal activity, instead of savvy avoid-the-second-apron-by-any-means business maneuvering — the crooks are always going to be ahead of the rules and regulations. Regardless of what the NBA powers-that-be do or however ironclad they make new laws to stop them. Losing games is a part of the game; losing the game ain’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So can we just for this moment start the R.I.P.-ing of tanking and fully embrace the beauty of the long-game art of positioning? Stop referring to the art of it as a crime? If, for one season, it’s putting lipstick and eyelash extensions on a pig, then just let the pig have its ‘‘America’s Next Top Model’’ moment in this moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s chess, not dominoes. It’s the ‘‘lose a million to get 10 million’’ game plan. A single-season movement. It’s not intentionally losing; it’s the art of winning by not winning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Margaret Croke, D-Chicago, who is running for Illinois comptroller, reported receiving the maximum campaign contribution of $72,800 from Gov. JB Pritzker on Feb. 19. Since then, Pritzker has appeared in some Croke campaign ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day before the Pritzker contribution was reported, I spoke with incumbent Comptroller Susana Mendoza about the governor’s support of Croke — who once worked in Pritzker’s administration and has been a legislative ally — and the near certainty at the time that Pritzker would be contributing to Croke’s campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendoza has prided herself on being independent of Pritzker, and noted that she has never accepted contributions from the governor because of that, even when he offered to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While stressing that she has worked with the governor in the past, and saying “Honestly, all of the people running are good people,” Mendoza said, “I've always been super clear that I work for the taxpayers and any appearance of not full independence coming from the controller's office is, I think, unhealthy for Illinoisans,” adding, “I would not have accepted money from the governor.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendoza defeated appointed Republican Leslie Munger, who then-Gov. Bruce Rauner once called his “wingman,” so she’s sensitive to this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-b00000\" name=\"module-b00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendoza also admitted that she considers Democratic comptroller candidate Holly Kim a friend and “mentee,” who would make “a great comptroller.” Kim is the Lake County treasurer. Mendoza has not made an official endorsement as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I asked Croke for a response. She told me during an interview that the comptroller is an “independent office,” adding, “I've always been very vocal on where I stand on things. I mean, I'm the youngest of three. I've had to assert myself a long time. I think that the governor endorsing me is a reflection of the fact that I've worked incredibly hard on this campaign, and he knows that I'm going to do a good job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Croke said that Pritzker’s chief of staff Anne Caprara (who has, um, a quite persuasive style) is a “great example,” of how Pritzker “doesn't surround himself with 'yes people.' And I am not a 'yes person.' I think that he appreciates independence. I think he appreciates strong leadership. But what frustrates me sometimes is that people conflate independence with being adversarial, and that's just not my style. I've always been someone who is collaborative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would argue that Susana likes to make her position, especially when it is adversarial to any constitutional officer, like she wants to make sure everyone knows about it,” Croke continued. “I'm someone who I feel like we can get things done, that we can collaborate and everyone can know exactly where I stand at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Croke noted that other Democratic constitutional officers have received campaign contributions from Pritzker and nobody is questioning their independence. After she said that, I pointed out that Attorney General Kwame Raoul has received huge contributions from Pritzker (totaling almost $4 million), and Croke asked rhetorically, “And then do we question what cases Kwame decides to bring or not bring because of that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked the other Democratic comptroller candidates to comment on Gov. Pritzker’s contribution and Croke’s independence. Here are some excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• State Rep. Stephanie Kifowit, D-Oswego, appeared to criticize Pritzker’s endorsement earlier in February, obliquely pointing to Rauner’s backing of Munger. “Accepting money and support from the Governor is not something that shows the public an independent Comptroller,” she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Kim replied with a statement: “The Comptroller is supposed to be an independent watchdog, not an extension of the governor’s political operation. When Rep. Croke, or any candidate, is being bankrolled by the same Governor she may need to challenge, it’s safe to assume she’ll be paying for it with her loyalty later.” Kim then pointed to the Senate Democrats’ funding of state Sen. Karina Villa, D-West Chicago, and the support Villa and Kifowit both received from former House Speaker Michael Madigan. “None of my opponents have ever run independent campaigns — they’re political insiders who rely on insider relationships,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Villa said Mendoza is “right to be concerned,” about the Pritzker support, but pointed to what she said were “tens of thousands” of dollars from “from right wing MAGA donors,” concluding, “If you want Democrats to trust you to be the last line of defense against Trump's cuts, you probably shouldn't be cozying up to his donors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rich Miller also publishes Capitol Fax, a daily political newsletter, and CapitolFax.com.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-bf0000\" name=\"module-bf0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.
