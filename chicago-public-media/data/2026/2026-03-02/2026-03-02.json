Maybe next year, Ramblers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is coach Drew Valentine still happy at Loyola?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I’d definitely be lying if I said I’m waking up as happy as I’ve been in the past,” he said Sunday, a day after the Ramblers’ 69-66 victory against Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, well, you’d be grumpy, too, if your team were 7-22 overall and in last place at 3-13 in the Atlantic 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the losing and aggravation are only temporary, Valentine said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His explanation for how it has gone so wrong this season is pretty simple: The Ramblers started out with pretty close to an all-new team, then everybody started getting hurt. Second-leading scorer Justin Moore has missed seven games and third-leading scorer Xavier Amos 14. In all, nine players have missed a combined 83 games because of injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walk-on Caleb Reese was needed for 16 minutes — and nailed two must-have free throws with 25 seconds left — for Loyola to squeeze past struggling Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Been a bizarre year,’’ Valentine said. ‘‘But my family’s healthy, and I guess that’s all that matters.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Mighty Michigan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things can change awfully fast in the college game now that the line between it and pro basketball is essentially nonexistent. Take No. 3 Michigan, which has gone from last place in the Big Ten two seasons ago — Juwan Howard’s flameout as coach — to first at an eye-popping 17-1 under Dusty May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It isn’t just May, of course. His team is so big, tough and talented, it pantsed No. 10 Illinois 84-70 on Friday in Champaign and stopped just short of stuffing the whole Illini team into a locker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illini might be a Final Four kind of team, as many have said throughout the season, but Michigan is — even without guard L.J. Cason, who tore an ACL on Friday — a national-championship kind of team. And there is a mighty big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. No offense, Billy Donovan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defending national champ Florida, getting ready to wrap up first place in the SEC, is extremely dangerous, too, having just handed Arkansas coach John Calipari his worst career loss in a 111-77 obliteration. Might the Gators go back-to-back? If so, should the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bulls\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Bulls&lt;/a&gt; hire Todd Golden?&lt;/p&gt;",

It’s settled, then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s definitely something happening with DePaul — something good, no less — no matter what unfolds in what little is likely left of this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Blue Demons are 16-13 entering their final two regular-season games — against Villanova and Butler, both at Wintrust Arena — meaning a winning end-of-season record for only the second time in 19 years is very possible. They are 8-10 in conference games, one off their all-time high in the Big East achieved by Jerry Wainwright’s 2006-07 team. They were picked to finish ninth in the 11-team league — the highest they’ve been picked in a decade, if you can believe it — but now they’re alone in fifth, and the top five seeds in the league tournament at Madison Square Garden receive first-round byes. DePaul never has been higher than the No. 7 seed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About those three roadies in a row? Never happened before for a Blue Demons team in 21 Big East seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those are just notes, nuggets and nibbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePaul is playing just plain better than it has in damn near forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘There is a tremendous energy around our program right now,’’ Holtmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of a 16-2 Marquette run that made it 50-47, the Blue Demons dominated much of the game. Their 21-1 run in the last 7:17 of the first half was so brutally lopsided, it looked like, well, pick a DePaul loss from the last 20 years or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marquette happens to be having its worst go of it in the Big East since the 2014-15 season, but the Blue Demons just swept the season series for the first time since 1991. That was multiple conferences ago for these old rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DePaul has swept always-tough Creighton, too, not to mention Seton Hall. Want to guess how many Blue Demons teams now have swept three home-and-homes in their Big East history? Hint: Just raise an index finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;celebrate accordingly 💦 &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/kbPQTrPpyw\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kbPQTrPpyw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; DePaul Basketball (@DePaulHoops) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/DePaulHoops/status/2028282955408261364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;March 2, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be four sweeps if they hadn’t blown an 18-point lead and lost at the buzzer at Xavier more than a month ago. That one stung. But that’s why Holtmann hung a one-word sign — ‘‘RESPONSE’’ — over the door from the team’s locker room to the hallway out to the court at Wintrust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Losing a game they had led 32-14 at the half would’ve been brutal. Didn’t happen. NJ Benson wouldn’t let it happen, finishing with 16 rebounds. Brandon Maclin scored 18 points but was even better at the other end, where DePaul plays defense as well as any Big East team outside of the league powerhouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twice in the first half alone, one Blue Demons player dived to the floor for a loose ball while three Marquette players didn’t. That kind of said it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘The best defensive half of our entire year,’’ Holtmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the first victory against Marquette, Holtmann bought pitchers of beer for of-age students at Homeslice in Lincoln Park. It had been the biggest student crowd at Wintrust since DePaul started playing there in the 2017-18 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, he rounded up two buses to take students to Milwaukee and popped for Homeslice pizza for all. They were stuck at the very top of Fiserv Forum, but Holtmann made sure to wave to them like a maniac after pregame introductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I’m sure the Marquette people were like, ‘What is he doing?’ ’’ Holtmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s starting to win, that’s what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something’s happening here.&lt;/p&gt;",

In Utah, they were excellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backup goalie Arvid Soderblom made 22 saves to record his first career shutout in the Hawks' 4-0 win over the Mammoth, but his teammates made his Sunday afternoon fairly easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's been a long time coming [through] a lot of ups and downs, but to finally get it done felt great,\" Soderbom said. \"The guys did a great job in front today. I thought we played our defensive system flawless. It was really good. We took away rebounds and everything.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks altered their breakout strategy in conjunction with &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/02/18/blackhawks-nhl-defensive-system-olympics-practice-jeff-blashill\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;changes to their overall defensive structure&lt;/a&gt; in practices after the Olympic break, and captain Nick Foligno said Friday they knew they might struggle with it during an adjustment period. They hoped better communication between forwards and defensemen could help them sort out the unfamiliar reads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After spending ample time in practice Friday working on it, then reviewing on Sunday morning video clips of breakouts during Saturday's loss to the Avalanche, it all clicked in their franchise's first-ever victory in Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Coming out of the break, we've played pretty good,\" coach Jeff Blashill said. \"We've limited a lot of chances. The difference tonight was we broke the puck out really, really well, so then you don't have to defend as much.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks also got the depth scoring they've craved. Teuvo Teravainen scored on both the power play and penalty kill, and Nick Foligno and Landon Slaggert's fourth line broke the game open with second-period goals less than two minutes apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Teuvo&amp;#39;s second goal of the game comes shorthanded! &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/ASwmTr2wtf\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ASwmTr2wtf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Blackhawks on CHSN (@CHSN_Blackhawks) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/CHSN_Blackhawks/status/2028245261282140554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;March 1, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Standout D&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks have come to rely immensely on Alex Vlasic and Louis Crevier's defensive pairing to shut things down whenever they sense momentum shifting against them, and that duo was superb Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vlasic, in particular, enjoyed one of his best performances of the season, doing his best Victor Hedman impression. His long stick broke up dozens of Mammoth passes and stripped the puck from guys who chose not to pass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And after getting those stops, he singlehandedly transported the puck out of the defensive zone and into the offensive zone on at least four occasions. The fourth led to Teravainen's shorthanded tally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Sometimes the legs are going; sometimes they're not,\" Vlasic said with his signature grin. \"I think the high altitude in Colorado kind of got me last night, but...my legs were chugging along tonight.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said Blashill: \"[Vlasic] was excellent tonight. He skated the puck out of trouble a ton. ... When you can skate like that, you can skate it up, and you can win your race on the way back, as well. It was a really strong game for him, but I think he's played very well for a long time.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rookie defenseman Artyom Levshunov also enjoyed his best — and definitely his most physical —&amp;nbsp;performance in a while. Since a costly first-period turnover in Nashville, he has calmed down and earned compliments from Blashill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The package is what's going to make [Levshunov] a special player,\" Blashill said. \"It's the physicality, the good defense and the ability to move the puck and create some offense.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Notes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Rinzel missed his second consecutive game due to illness, with Kevin Korchinski replacing him but receiving limited ice time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyatt Kaiser (knee injury) won't face the Jets on Tuesday but is expected to practice fully Thursday, meaning he will likely return Friday — deadline day — at home against the Canucks.&lt;/p&gt;",

And while he had just one hit in 13 at-bats before leaving the team for Team Italy Saturday, the left-handed hitter is controlling the strike zone, manager Will Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results don’t matter all that much right now, because Teel showed he can hit last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think he’s going to be an elite offensive catcher in this league,” Venable said Sunday. “We saw that last year [when he hit .273/.375/.411 with eight homers in 79 games]. Looking forward to what the next version of that looks like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The switch-hitting Edgar Quero, who hit .268/.333/.356 with five homers in 111 games, homered against Cubs lefty Shota Imanaga Sunday. He’s 9-for-17 (.526) with two doubles and a homer this spring and leading the Cactus League with nine RBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venable would prefer having his players stick around in camp but he’s not stressing much about losing Teel and versatile infielder Sam Antonacci to Team Italy, even though catchers’ work with pitchers is important here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s put in a ton of work, last year and the front side of camp here,” Venable said of Teel. “We’re missing out on some reps and that’s a real thing but he’ll jump right back in. He’s done such a good job with that kind of stuff that we’ll catch up on him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Big A&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The left-handed hitting Antonacci heads to the WBC having reached safely in six straight games with two homers, seven runs scored, three walks and three stolen bases. He hasn’t struck out in 18 plate appearances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s locked in and he has one speed, and that’s all the way,” Venable said. “It’s great to see, it really sets an example for our guys and what it’s supposed to look like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No auditions necessary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining the Team Italy players in the WBC are corner infielders Munetaka Murakami (Japan) and Curtis Mead (Australia) and closer Seranthony Dominguez (Dominican Republic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides rooting for them to do well, Venable said the staff will be more locked in on Sox campers in the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And how Antonacci plays in the tournament won’t win or lose him a job with the Sox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That performance is really separate and really he doesn’t have to do anything here,” Venable said. “We have an understanding of where he’s at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We like Sam, he’s in a good spot. Whatever that means for him, joining us whether it’s Opening Day or later in the year, he’s going to be someone who contributes regardless of how he plays with Team Italy or the rest of camp.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left fielder Andrew Benintendi (tightness in right side) won’t play until after the Sox’ off day Wednesday, Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a good chance center fielder and infielder Luisangel Acuna (cut on forehead) will play Monday for the first time since Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*The Sox lead all of baseball in hits (107) and doubles (29) this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sox 5, Cubs 1&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox (7-4) hit four solo homers, three against Shota Imanaga, and lefty Anthony Kay allowed one run over 2 ⅔ innings against the Cubs’ top lineup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edgar Quero, Braden Montgomery and Austin Hays hit solo shots against Imanaga and Lenyn Sosa also went deep. Hays, who owns an .819 OPS against lefties, homered for the second time against the Cubs. Montgomery, the Sox’ top outfield prospect who was acquired from Boston in the Garrett Crochet trade, also tripled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Kay, who made 13 relief appearances for the Cubs in 2023 before pitching successfully as a starter the last two seasons in Japan, laughed when asked if the Cactus League game had a “rivalry” feel before a full house at Sloan Park. The Sox beat the Cubs 8-1 in the spring opener at Sloan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not really,” Kay said. “A little different for me since I was there. Kind of want to get a little bit of revenge but it’s spring training so it doesn’t really matter just yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teams play for real May 15-17 at Rate Field and Aug. 17-19 at Wrigley Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Infielder Tanner Murray made the defensive play in an error-free game for the Sox, diving behind third base to take extra bases from Nico Hoerner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• On deck: Giants at Sox, 2:05 p.m. Monday, Glendale, 1000-AM, Landen Roupp vs. Davis Martin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Unsurprisingly, he had one of his best games of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 32:15 of playing time Sunday, Giddey compiled 20 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists for his eighth triple-double of the season and 15th with the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bulls\"   &gt;Bulls&lt;/a&gt;, tying &lt;b&gt;Scottie Pippen&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;for the second-most in team history. The 32:15 of playing time was also the most for Giddey since Dec. 26 when he logged 32:37 in a win over the 76ers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giddey was somewhat handcuffed by &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bulls/2026/02/19/bulls-will-be-work-in-progress-as-they-add-josh-giddey-tre-jones-back-to-the-fold\"   &gt;restrictions that limited him&lt;/a&gt; to 25 minutes per game over the Bulls’ last five and hurt his ability to get into a rhythm. Giddey has not used that as an excuse, but the issue was moot Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just about getting rhythm, it’s about getting into the flow of things,” said Giddey, who has missed 21 games this season, 19 of them due to left hamstring issues. “Playing those kind of normal minutes does help a player just get back to normal rhythm, but I can’t make excuses.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giddey said he hopes the minutes restrictions were done after Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tre Jones&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;also got an extended run, playing 27:32. Absent from 18 games this season because of left ankle and left hamstring problems, Jones was averaging 23.6 minutes over the past five contests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m happy for those guys because I know they get frustrated,” coach &lt;b&gt;Billy Donovan&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;said. “They also understand, but they’re competitive and want to play more when they can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hold the ball&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls came into Sunday’s game averaging 14.3 turnovers per game, 21st in the league. That average, however, has been rising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over their prior five games, the Bulls were averaging 21.2 giveaways. Donovan excused turnovers that happen because of execution and not because players are on different pages. The ones caused by poor spacing and making bad decisions with the ball aren’t viewed the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We put those things on [tape] and try to help them get them to see it,” Donovan said. “It's easy for me in the position I'm in to show them film in slow motion of options, but they're having to make split-second decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls were somewhat better with the ball Sunday, committing 18 turnovers but canceling that out with 35 assists. Behind Giddey, Jones had six assists and &lt;b&gt;Guerschon Yabusele&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;collected five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;VIP guests&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pippen, not a frequent visitor to the United Center, sat in a suite with team president &lt;b&gt;Michael Reinsdorf&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;and former dynasty teammate &lt;b&gt;Toni Kukoc&lt;/b&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the other guests in the suite was Bears coach &lt;b&gt;Ben Johnson&lt;/b&gt;. Johnson was introduced to the crowd during the second quarter and received a loud ovation. Johnson, who met pregame with Donovan, even faked that he would take his shirt off like he did in the locker room after the Bears’ Black Friday win over the Eagles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Doc’s thoughts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bucks coach &lt;b&gt;Doc Rivers&lt;/b&gt; opened his pregame availability by saying he was thinking about the “Hammond Bulls,” referencing the Bears’ meandering path to a new stadium that might lead them to Northwest Indiana. The Milwaukee coach was born in Chicago and starred at Proviso East in Maywood.&lt;/p&gt;",

Four stitches above his left eye kept him out of the lineup but not from fully participating on the back fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think he [ just needs] reps,” manager Will Venable said. “We talked about a lot of different things with him. Certainly the pre-pitch is something guys going from infield to outfield, there’s a little bit of a different timing component he’s picking up. He does great in space and is flying around the field. Throwing is something that’s a little different too. It’s a little bit of a different arm stroke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acuna’s athleticism is exceptional, so the tools are there. But he’s going to need time, and the development will carry over into the season. Miguel Cairo, the Mets’ minor league field coordinator in 2023, endorsed Acuna’s work habits to the Sox’ front office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His throwing is being addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a different mindset with throwing,” Venable said of the outfield. “We are working on the footwork and being able to hit the cutoff man. So he’s out there, throwing to bases and he understands the responsibilities of an outfielder and putting in all the work to be better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acuna as a work in progress defensively is the center piece of an outfield that might not save many runs for the Sox pitching staff. A skeptic might say they have a designated hitter (Andrew Benintendi) in left, an infielder (Acuna) in center and a left fielder (Austin Hays, who has played a significant majority of his career there) in right. Benintendi was a minus-0.9 bWar player in left, compromised by a sore Achilles and a below average arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limited by health issues the last two seasons in Cincinnati and Baltimore, Hays is regarded as an above average defender, but he’ll be asked to play the more demanding corner in right. He can also play center and “in the spirit of versatility” Venable is pushing, will be asked to move around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outfielder/infielder Brooks Baldwin, who misplayed a ball in the sun in center Sunday, is also in the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Acuna, who played center in winter ball, can make the right moves to establish himself in center. He says he likes it there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m happy, I’m very happy,” Acuna said of his adjustment to a new position, team and surroundings. “I feel good here. There’s a good vibe here and I feel like I belong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert no longer belongs, in large part because he couldn’t stay on the field enough, beset by injuries in all but one season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most frustrating thing in baseball is a guy with off-the-charts talent whose body doesn’t allow him to show it on a daily basis,” broadcaster Steve Stone said. “I hope he can stay healthy consistently in New York. When he was healthy he was devastating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so the Sox moved on to the next experiment in center. The Sox can only hope Acuna is one day mentioned in the same sentence as “devastating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned to see how it develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel very comfortable in center field,” he said. “I’m very happy and excited about having this opportunity to play there.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Richards grabbed the ball with one hand and slammed it down to give the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bulls\"   &gt;Bulls&lt;/a&gt; a 16-point lead, igniting the announced crowd of 20,749.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment seemed to be cathartic for the Bulls, who snapped an 11-game losing streak with a 120-97 win over Milwaukee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know it’s been frustrating for [the players], I know I’m in the locker room after a game and after a loss they feel like they’re working hard, they’re trying hard,” Bulls coach Billy Donovan said. “I’ve never had a problem with their effort at all – it’s just been more [of] the turnovers, trying to learn a new system, new style, new teammates, all of that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To see them stick with it for a whole month like this and to go through the struggles of that, I just appreciate the way they’ve stayed together and just continued to try to come back in each day to work to get better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donovan insisted that he saw growth during the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bulls/2026/02/26/bulls-good-night-lose-and-right-team-to-lose-to-in-portland\"   &gt;struggles of a winless February.&lt;/a&gt; On Sunday, he also saw the Bulls put together a 27-0 run spanning the last 1:12 of the third quarter and first 5:59 of the fourth, turning what had been a 14-point deficit into a 13-point lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giddey said he didn’t know how long the run was until he was told after the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It felt good,” Giddey said. “It felt like we were making them take a lot of tough shots. NBA players are good, so they’re going to make tough shots but they went through a stretch where they couldn’t really hit anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The run was part of a dominant second half when the Bulls held Milwaukee to only 31 points, including just eight in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m proud of our guys,” said Matas Buzelis, who had 20 points and credited the Bulls’ attention to detail as a difference-maker Sunday. “We played really hard and we figured it out a little bit. I’m proud of everybody.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, the Bulls were aided by the continued absence of Giannis Antetokounmpo, who didn't play due to a right calf strain but sat on Milwaukee’s bench. The Bucks also helped the Bulls as Giddey said, shooting 36.8% from the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the reasons, the Bulls were glad to earn their first win since a Jan. 31 victory over Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any time you go on a losing streak like that, every game becomes more and more desperate,” Giddey said. “You, as a group, want to try to snap that streak as quickly as you can. Obviously, it dragged out to 11, which none of us would have wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The month of February saw a lot of events the Bulls would have wanted to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out the door went Nikola Vucevic, Coby White and Ayo Dosunmu. The Bulls went from a team playing for a spot in the play-in to one looking at next season and beyond, seemingly hoping to acquire as many second-round picks and guards as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the first day of March, Donovan is working with a group that’s vastly different from the one he led in late January. Donovan, his staff and the players are working to build chemistry on the fly on a team with two cornerstones and little else guaranteed to be in Chicago next season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is what it is, so to speak,” Donovan said. “You’ve got to move forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the group was able to move forward with a win.&lt;/p&gt;",

Mountjoy and other relatives in the diaspora keep a system of shifts based on time zones, so someone is waiting for calls and messages somewhere in the world at any given time of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said due to communications blackouts, they can only occasionally make outgoing calls for about $3 per minute.  Video calls often aren’t an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just want to be able to connect with my family in real time again,\" Mountjoy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Trump signaled he was open to talks with Iran's new leadership after U.S. and Israeli forces launched a major attack on the country over the weekend, killing its supreme leader and other high-ranking officials, the Associated Press reported. But the attacks on Iran showed no signs of relenting, and Trump told the Daily Mail Sunday that the war could go on for \"four weeks — or less.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narimon Safavi, a Chicago-based Iranian-American, has been living in the U.S. for more than 40 years. He co-founded the now-closed Pasfarda Art &amp;amp; Cultural Exchange, which was based in Chicago and aimed to build cultural bridges between the U.S. and Iran. Safavi said the split between the country he has lived in and the one he was born in has been tough to bridge, and it's only worsened by the Islamophobia that has festered in the U.S. after its decades of wars in the Middle East. The sympathies extended to other diasporas in America whose home countries are at war, such as Ukrainians, are not offered to Iranians, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have this dual identity,” Safavi said. “Having that linger all your life is a weight to carry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safavi was hoping to see more from Iran's people, as a women’s movement had gained rights in recent years. But protests over the last few months led the government to kill thousands of demonstrators in the streets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he said, violence begets violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“U.S. military action may gain surface level removal of a dictator, but they destabilized the region in ways we can't see right now,” he said. “I don't know if I want to be liberated by people like [Israel Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu and Trump.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-200000\" name=\"image-200000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/461a99a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/936x525+0+49/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2d%2Fa9%2F8ba7c5f740929b21aa829d883366%2Fabusharif.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5e8b36d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/936x525+0+49/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2d%2Fa9%2F8ba7c5f740929b21aa829d883366%2Fabusharif.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b66559/2147483647/strip/true/crop/936x525+0+49/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2d%2Fa9%2F8ba7c5f740929b21aa829d883366%2Fabusharif.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Ibrahim Abusharif teaches journalism and religion at Northwestern University’s campus in Doha, Qatar.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b66559/2147483647/strip/true/crop/936x525+0+49/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2d%2Fa9%2F8ba7c5f740929b21aa829d883366%2Fabusharif.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c77bbf6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/936x525+0+49/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2d%2Fa9%2F8ba7c5f740929b21aa829d883366%2Fabusharif.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0b66559/2147483647/strip/true/crop/936x525+0+49/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2d%2Fa9%2F8ba7c5f740929b21aa829d883366%2Fabusharif.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibrahim Abusharif teaches journalism and religion at Northwestern University’s campus in Doha, Qatar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibrahim Abusharif was on a flight to Qatar from Chicago when the war began over the weekend.

He said classes will continue Monday, but virtually, and that his colleagues and students have been safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abusharif said Iran was willing to let go of its nuclear ambitions if they could get rid of the economic sanctions imposed on the country, and that the U.S. and Israel had once again instigated violence and destabilized the region — which he called \"completely avoidable.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he was especially affected by the strike that killed more than 100 school girls in southern Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It’s yet another American-Israeli war in the Middle East,\" Abusharif said. “It’s useless, a waste of life. People are noticing that [the American and Israeli strikes] are close to the Gaza playbook with health centers and schools being targeted. … It’s hard to believe that’s accidental. You’re trying to break people by doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safavi said he has been cooking Persian food to “try to forget everything and feed some family and friends.” His go-to is kuku sabzi, which he described as an herb quiche that's like a cake. He said he hopes to take more solace in Iranian culture as the Persian new year, Nowruz, approaches March 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m just hoping for peace,” he added. “I feel kinda helpless these days.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mountjoy hasn’t been to Iran since 2014, where her grandmother and other loved ones still live, though she has never stopped dreaming of a different vision for the country guided by a memory from a 2002 family reunion in Spain. One of her cousins, who has since left Iran, wore her hair and clothes the “way she wanted to” for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't know what the right answer is to get to this state I have in my mind of a free Iran, I just know what's been tried before,” Mountjoy said. “I saw her taking a deep breath of freedom, and that is the emotion I want to build around.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contributing: AP&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

After some thrilling upsets, the supersectional games Monday should be very competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Class 8A: Rolling Meadows vs. Carmel, 7:30 p.m. at Dundee-Crown&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rolling Meadows is the lowest seed left in the Class 4A tournament. The Mustangs defeated Prospect, the No. 1 seed in the Schaumburg Sectional, in the sectional semifinal and No. 3 seed Fremd in the sectional final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rolling Meadows is led by senior forward Abby Ramel, who scored 23 points and grabbed eight rebounds in the sectional final. Senior center Dalia Grandberry is an imposing low-post threat who had a double-double (10 points, 10 rebounds) in the sectional final.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mustangs will have their hands full with Carmel. The Corsairs grinded their way to a 38-35 victory against Libertyville in the sectional final, giving them the first Class 4A sectional title in program history. Winning big or winning by three doesn’t matter in the playoffs; it’s all about surviving and advancing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carmel features freshman standout Liv Johnson, who’s one of the best freshmen in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Johnson isn’t one to hog the ball. She’s able to affect the game with her defense — she is athletic enough to guard on the perimeter and be a rim protector in the paint — and knows how to leverage the attention she draws on offense into scoring opportunities for her teammates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Josie Hartman is a steady presence at point guard, and junior guard Maliyah Mays is a disruptive defender at forward because of her superb athleticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Class 8A: Loyola vs. St. Charles East, 7 p.m. at Hoffman Estates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loyola features one of the most battle-tested backcourts in the area in seniors Marycait Mackie and Clare Weasler (12 points per game), who are the winningest players in program history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emergence of junior forward Emily Naraky (15 ppg) has been a difference-maker for the Ramblers. She has a soft touch around the basket and, more important, is able to operate as the hub for the offense because of her ballhandling and passing skills. Junior forward Maddison Locke is at her best when she’s cutting to the basket and scoring on offensive rebounds. Loyola works well as a unit, which is a major advantage in the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Charles East defeated No. 1 seed Glenbard West in the Bartlett Sectional. Sophomore forward Brooklyn Schilb (22 ppg) is one of the best players in the area at taking the ball to the basket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Super 25 update&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top 10 of the Super 25 is substantially different from the one last week because I’m letting the postseason dictate the rankings. It might seem strange to see certain teams outside the top 10, but I wanted to reward those that have advanced to the final week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.
