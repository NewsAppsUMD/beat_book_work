After the game, a solemn Imanaga took on his share of the blame, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have so many really good players that can perform,” Imanaga said then, through Japanese interpreter Edwin Stanberry. “And just watching that, it was amazing. And for me personally, I need to get to that level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offseason brought a series of contract option decisions, for both him and the Cubs, that briefly &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/11/04/cubs-left-hander-shota-imanaga-becomes-free-agent-after-club-and-player-options-declined\"   &gt;sent Imanaga into free agency.&lt;/a&gt; The saga ended when Imanaga &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/11/06/cubs-extend-qualifying-offers-to-shota-imanaga-and-kyle-tucker\"   &gt;agreed to the qualifying offer to return for 2026.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He'd shown what he can do at such a high level, and then just to not quite have that when we needed it the most down the stretch – he wanted more,” Hottovy said. “He thinks there’s more in there, there's more to prove. And you can tell by the way he's come into spring training that he feels that way because he's in such a great place from where he was at the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/10/06/how-shota-imanagas-throwing-philosopher-side-came-out-post-injury-nlds-brewers-game-2\"   &gt;end of the year last year&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imanaga also had to decide whether to participate in the World Baseball Classic this spring, after winning the championship with Team Japan in 2023. At winter meetings in December, national team manager Hirokazu Ibata said through an interpreter that he would be disappointed if Imanaga opted out of the tournament because of the caliber of player he is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imanaga’s circumstances, however, had changed since last WBC. He was now playing for an MLB team, which was involved in the decision-making process, and knew he needed a bounce-back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm talking to everybody around me, getting everybody's opinion,” Imanaga said Thursday. “We thought that making your own adjustments, practicing here in Arizona is probably for the best.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imanaga has been one of the Cubs’ top starters for much of his time in MLB, finishing fifth in NL Cy Young voting his rookie season and starting last season with an Opening Day nod and strong first half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs believe the hamstring strain Imanaga sustained in May impacted his execution down the stretch, through some combination of a loss of strength and/or trust in his left leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His delivery does have a lot of like depth in terms of how he gets in his back leg,” Hottovy said. “But his strength comes from holding that position and then rotating hard late. And I think he was having to [adjust] how he was rotating, which was then affecting how his arm path was. And he knew he was trying to get his arm path up a little bit and slightly higher arm release point, but he just couldn't do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming into spring, the force Imanaga is generating from that drive leg, measured by force plate technology in the Cubs’ spring training facilities, is comparable to in-game measurements before the injury, Hottovy said. That’s an improvement on his bullpens this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More importantly, we're just seeing very consistent mechanics right now, too,” Hottovy said, “and him not trying to search for anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imanga said he focused on his overall strength this offseason, but also \"leveling up” every other aspect of his game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Imanaga’s fastball was getting hit for home runs at a higher clip, it was often because he wasn’t getting the pitch to the top rail or the bottom of the zone. So, that will be a focal point this spring. But Hottovy also highlighted several ways Imanaga could hone and expand his arsenal, from taking another step forward with his sweeper, to reintroducing his cutter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you're chasing a specific version of you from a different year, you can go into a downward spiral,” Imanaga said, pushing back on the notion that he was trying to recapture an earlier version of himself. “So instead of focusing on what I had in the past, just try to be a better version of what I am right now.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Shah, who issued &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/News-Room/Current-News/2022%2002%2012%20TRO%20CDC%20grants.pdf?language_id=1\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;the temporary restraining order&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the Northern District Court of Illinois, said the attorneys general were “likely to succeed” in their argument because the Trump administration’s cuts were based on “arbitrary, capricious or unconstitutional” reasons, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raoul said Trump was “playing politics with critical public health funding\" by cutting millions of dollars from HIV tracking and lead poisoning prevention from California, Colorado, Illinois and Minnesota. He said the order ensures funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with other funds will continue flowing to Illinois while the case plays out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Targeting four Democrat-run states that are standing up to his completely unrelated immigration policies is a transparent attempt to bully us into compliance,” Raoul said in a statement. “We remain unflinching in our commitment to defending against the Trump administration’s continued unlawful directives intended to force us to implement immigration and other unrelated policies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, at least &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2026/02/10/trump-administration-cuts-illinois-hiv-prevention-grants\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;$29 million in Illinois grants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are on the “hit list” being held up by the judge’s order, which include city, state and other health centers’ family planning and HIV prevention programs, according to a list of grants obtained by the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also included $7.2 million in grant cuts to the American Medical Association in Illinois, which supports gender-affirming care, as well as $5.2 million slashed from an HIV prevention program at Lurie Children’s Hospital — which recently was &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/health/2026/01/20/lurie-childrens-pauses-gender-affirming-meds-under-18\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;threatened with another federal investigation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over its gender-affirming care for youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Raoul said the cuts would force the Illinois Department of Public Health to cut nearly 100 employees, end lead poisoning prevention grants to 25 local health departments and wipe out the state’s HIV surveillance system that tracks the spread of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the latest legal win for Raoul and other attorneys general across the country suing the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Raoul was part of a large coalition of legal officials that won a suit for the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/09/24/illinois-wins-suit-on-disaster-relief-funding-held-by-dhs-over-sanctuary-laws\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;release of $2 billion in federal disaster relief funding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; held up by the White House over sanctuary city policies.

Instead, they largely shared their campaign priorities and laid bare the reasoning why they were relegated to a separate debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s telling that there are multiple aspects of our democratic process that are broken because… we only look to money as the only metric of viability. This debate is a great example,” said Democratic primary challenger Kevin Ryan, a Chicago Public Schools teacher and U.S. Marine veteran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics and International House hosted and moderated the event.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two University of Chicago students asked the candidates six questions, in topics ranging from immigration, taxes, rising cost of living and foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Democratic runners shared a general consensus on abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency; raising taxes on ultra wealthy individuals and corporations; reducing the U.S. government’s military budget and reallocating that money to services like housing and health care; and ending U.S. military support for Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maxwell said the government can’t address the rising cost of living without cutting the roughly $1 trillion U.S. military budget and raising money through increased taxes on millionaires and billionaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to actually put more money back into the hands of people in this country,” said Maxwell, an agricultural engineer at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “...We’re the richest country in the world, there’s absolutely no reason people should be going without food, housing and health care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div

Botsford also noted that he agreed with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., “trying to get Americans to focus on more real foods and away from carbohydrates and sugary snacks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long said she supports Trump’s “America first” agenda and his border security. She acknowledged that while immigration enforcement “has to happen, but it needs to be done humanely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to leading the fundraising effort, Krishnamoorthi has led most polls in the race, including a WGN-TV/Emerson College poll last month. That poll gave him 31% support over 10% for Stratton and 8% for Kelly, while 45% of poll respondents were undecided.&lt;/p&gt;",

That's a rarity in high-level Public League basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as the city playoffs hit the final rounds and the state playoffs loom just ten days away, Hyde Park is taking on a more prominent role in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loyalty,” Thunderbirds senior Amare Leflore said. “We’ve developed a relationship off the court that is really going to help us in this push over the next month.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leflore scored 19 points to help Hyde Park to a 74-45 win against visiting Fenger on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/12/chicago-illinois-high-school-basketball-scores\"   &gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in the Public League playoffs. The win sends Hyde Park into Saturday’s quarterfinals against the winner of Crane vs. Lindblom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kye Ward-Owens, Jacobi Walls and Zyere McNeal are the other three loyal seniors. Ward-Owens scored 20 points against the Titans (13-14).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistency has been the biggest thing for us this year, trying to get all of us to play good at one time,” Ward-Owens said. “But it is all starting to fall together now. At the perfect time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thunderbirds (20-7) broke the game open in the third quarter, outscoring Fenger 30-12. The Titans had 28 turnovers in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our coaches really emphasize defensive pressure, and we went out there and executed,” Ward-Owens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curie is a heavy favorite to win the city championship, but Hyde Park is right there in the next tier of contenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[The city tournament] is something I’ve been looking forward to since I was a little kid,” Leflore said. “Being a senior and being able to compete for something I’ve watched most of my life is pretty exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right before the game began, the Thunderbirds learned they had earned the No. 1 seed in the Class 3A De La Salle Sectional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was a huge confidence boost,” Leflore said. “It just boosted team morale and everything.

Each site will have 12 to 20 drones, Amazon officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though delivery costs will vary, Amazon Prime members will pay $4.99 per delivery.  Shoppers might also get an option for free shipping for orders of more than  $50, said Josh Brundage, Prime Air senior manager of commercial operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers choosing drone delivery will receive an aerial satellite image of their homes with predetermined delivery points to decide where they want the package delivered. Deliveries are expected to happen in less than two hours, Brundage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drones are capable of using cameras for self navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement from Amazon comes as the expansion of other autonomous delivery devices including Coco robots and Serve robots &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/business/2026/delivery-robots-chicago-food-coco-robotics\"   &gt;has become contentious as some residents call for their removal&lt;/a&gt;. While the launch is only coming to Markham and Matteson's fulfillment centers, Brundage said the goal is to continue expanding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The south suburbs will join other autonomous drone delivery sites across the country including Texas, Florida, Michigan and Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We want to bring this everywhere we can,\" Brundage said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, \"certain geographies, or more challenging downtown areas, things like that, right now pose a challenge. But everywhere where we can provide this service, we certainly want to.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are skeptical, Brundage said Amazon will host community events. The next one is taking place from 3 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., March 2 at the Tinley Park Convention Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Just like any new technology, you know, sometimes people are a little leery to adopt it, but usually once they see it and once they see what it's capable of, it genuinely becomes a big deal of excitement,\" Brundage said.&lt;/p&gt;",

It seeks to reclaim the roughly $1.9 million in “misappropriated” funds through the fraudulent checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the village declined to comment further on the lawsuit, citing the ongoing litigation. A spokesperson for Fifth Third Bank also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henyard served one term as the south suburban mayor, from May 2021 to May 2025, after Mayor Jason House won in a landslide election to unseat her.

The statement also points to the shooting that wounded Marimar Martinez, who survived after being shot multiple times by a federal agent last year. It asks the state’s attorney to investigate any and “all available charges” and “use of excessive force” in the shootings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also point to the historic disproportionate use of force by law enforcement against Black residents, and said justice must be applied evenly because, “No officer and no agency is above the law.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement agenda has produced a clear and alarming pattern of violence,” the statement said. “We support thorough law enforcement investigations wherever federal agents have violated the law. We urge the Cook County State’s Attorney to act swiftly, proactively and transparently to ensure accountability and deliver justice for the families and communities who have been harmed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes just over a week after Illinois House Democrats &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ilhousedems.com/2026/02/03/elected-officials-call-on-cook-county-states-attorney-eileen-oneil-burke-to-investigate-the-fatal-shooting-of-silverio-villegas-gonzalez-and-the-near-fatal-shooting-of-marimar-martin/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;released a similar call to action&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aimed at the state’s attorney’s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cook County State’s Attorney’s office said though Burke is “deeply concerned” about the “abhorrent behavior” of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents nationwide, her office “does not conduct independent investigations into criminal conduct and lacks jurisdiction over federal agencies, except in extremely narrow and limited circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke said her team has drafted a protocol for how local legal systems can respond to federal agents in a way that’s “clear and grounded in law,” which the office said has been shared with local and state law enforcement, as well as other prosecutors for feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are committed to doing all we can under the law to support and review law enforcement investigations of that conduct and prosecute when appropriate,” Burke's office said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/06/eileen-oneill-burke-brandon-johnson-immigration-ice-law\"   &gt;County’s top prosecutor calls Mayor Brandon Johnson’s ICE executive order ‘wholly inappropriate’&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/02/03/mayor-brandon-johnson-executive-order-accountability-ice-agents-operation-midway-blitz-states-attorney-eileen-oneill-burke\"   &gt;Mayor Johnson defends executive order aimed at holding ICE accountable for alleged abuses&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Burke has found herself between local leaders grasping at ways to hold federal agents accountable for wounding and killing residents, federal laws that often block those actions, and President Donald Trump's administration which has blocked use of force investigations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Burke told her staff that Mayor Brandon Johnson’s recent &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/02/03/mayor-brandon-johnson-executive-order-accountability-ice-agents-operation-midway-blitz-states-attorney-eileen-oneill-burke\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;executive order&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which orders CPD to document potential crimes committed by federal agents — is inappropriate and could jeopardize criminal prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/02/03/mayor-brandon-johnson-executive-order-accountability-ice-agents-operation-midway-blitz-states-attorney-eileen-oneill-burke\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;defended the move&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and said he was trying to help Burke by providing evidence for prosecutions of federal agents, which he claimed she has spoken about publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s one of many moves state, county and local officials have taken in attempts to curb federal agents in the Chicago area, though many have faced legal uncertainty, and experts have cast doubt on one executive order Johnson signed in August that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/08/30/mayor-johnson-protecting-chicago-initiative-executive-order\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;threatened lawsuits against federal agents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, now former Cook County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Evans &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/14/top-cook-county-judge-bars-civil-arrests-at-courthouses-citing-chilling-effect\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;signed an order&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; barring civil arrests, or those without a warrant signed by a judge, at county courts, though federal officials vowed to violate it anyways.&lt;/p&gt;",

But we feel really confident that out of the group, there’s some guys that are going to hit that way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guy called on in save situations, however, will likely be one of the few returning relievers. In fact, manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell&lt;/b&gt; was surprisingly definitive when asked if right-hander &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/11/cubs-catcher-miguel-amaya-poised-for-bounce-back-after-injury-riddled-2025\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Daniel Palencia&lt;/b&gt; would get the ninth inning&lt;/a&gt; if the season began the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a sharp turn from his usual go-to answer about “out-getters.” But Counsell’s usual reluctance to define roles comes from years of experience of managing ever-changing bullpen groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Craig did a really good job in our meeting [Monday], just talking about how our bullpen evolved last year,” president of baseball operations &lt;b&gt;Jed Hoyer&lt;/b&gt; said, “and how we have all these guys in camp right now and how to focus on each guy because we don’t know how that’s going to shake out. It’s a volatile area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoyer pointed to Palencia, who went from being left off the 2025 Opening Day roster to serving as the team’s closer for much of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using that example, we need multiple Daniel Palencias every year to step up to do things that may not have been expected,” Hoyer said. “Because especially the bullpen, there’s going to be injuries and poor performance that are going to lead to opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palencia posted a career-best 2.91 ERA in his breakout 2025 season, almost doubling his previous career high in innings with 52⅔.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Always I knew I was that guy for that situation,” Palencia said this week. “So I just tried to be ready. And last year, the lights, everything, it was awesome for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palencia made clear, however, that he was up for any role Counsell chose. He proved that in the playoffs, when he served as the “fireman,” entering in high-leverage situations no matter the inning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palencia mostly relies on his fastball, which averaged 99.6 mph last season, and splitter. But to continue elevating his game, he said he hopes to up the usage of his splitter this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hitting the ground running&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not taking any time to ease into spring training, Cubs hitters &lt;b&gt;Alex Bregman&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Michael Busch&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Pete Crow-Armstrong&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Seiya Suzuki&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Miguel Amaya &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Nico Hoerner&lt;/b&gt; all have taken live batting practice in the first two days of camp. Bregman left the complex Thursday morning, however, with an illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs signed right-hander &lt;b&gt;Kyle Wright&lt;/b&gt; to a minor-league deal, a source confirmed, and he threw a bullpen session at the complex Thursday. But the team has not yet officially announced his addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Right-hander &lt;b&gt;Javier Assad&lt;/b&gt;, after his arrival was delayed by visa issues, was in camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Right-hander &lt;b&gt;Trent Thornton&lt;/b&gt;, who is behind in his build-up after tearing his Achilles in August, threw a bullpen session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, title=Latest on the Cubs, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, items=[{type=Image, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, anchorId=promo-630004, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/maddie-lee, name=[{items=[Maddie Lee]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[], media=[], jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Cubs reporter]}]}], title=Cubs&amp;#x27;

Graciela Guzman (D-Chicago) would codify much of the Federal Voting Rights Act into state law as insurance in case that law is repealed by Republicans in Congress. If passed, the changes to state law would take effect July 1 ahead of November's general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The last year has made one thing remarkably clear: Democracy does not run on autopilot,” she said. “It only survives if people are willing to protect it, and at the center of that responsibility is a fundamental right to vote.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill would specifically grant judges the ability to redraw racially imbalanced legislative maps and require non-English speaking voters receive translated ballots, access to bilingual poll workers, or over-the-phone non-English assistance, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation comes amid GOP attempts to weaken longstanding federal voting protections by requiring proof of citizenship and photo ID at the ballot box as well as attempts to invalidate mail-in-ballots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats controlled legislative map-making, which preserved the party's supermajority hold over the General Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roderick Wilson, executive director of the Bronzeville-based Lugenia Burns Hope Center, says that gerrymandering of legislative districts has come at the expense of Black and Brown representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A democracy is supposed to represent you,” Wilson said. “For people of color in America, we haven't had representation in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Federal Voting Rights Act was about protecting people...was about protecting people of color and minorities in this country,\" Wilson said. \"Instead, we have become party over race, and that has to stop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to become law by the fall, the legislation would need to pass both chambers of the state legislature and be enacted by Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker.&lt;/p&gt;",

Hill Early Childhood Center, face aggravated criminal sexual abuse, according to court documents. They were arrested by Chicago police Feb. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendez, 51, and Flores Hernandez abused the child, who did not attend the Evanston/Skokie School District 65, “through the coordination of grooming and coercion” for nearly two years. Mendez was also alleged to have abused two other children who didn't attend the school where Mendez worked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Evanston/Skokie District 65 said Mendez has been on a leave of absence from his job as assistant principal since Oct. 28, and Flores Hernandez has been on a leave of absence of her job since Jan. 16. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It is the District’s understanding that the allegations in question are unrelated to their professional responsibilities and do not involve any District 65 students. The safety and wellbeing of our community remains our highest priority. While these allegations are deeply concerning, this is a personnel matter and we are unable to share additional details at this time,\" the district said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Cook County court hearing the day after their arrests, Flores Hernandez and Mendez were ordered detained, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In several instances between 2023 and 2025, Flores Hernandez and Mendez allegedly touched a minor inappropriately, and prosecutors added that when the girl tried to refuse their actions, Flores Hernandez would grow angry. Mendez is accused of doing sexual acts on the child in October 2025, telling the child — now 15 — to \"relax,\" according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child told her father about the sexual assault and he then called police. The child was taken to Lurie Children's Hospital for treatment, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three other children also said they were abused, officials said. Mendez and Flores Hernandez have outstanding warrants out of Florida over an alleged sexual assault incident that happened in June 2025 that involved another minor, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their next court date was scheduled for Feb. 25 at the George N. Leighton Criminal Courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;",

The Obama-era finding is the legal underpinning of nearly all climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The repeal eliminates all greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and trucks and could unleash a broader undoing of climate regulations on stationary sources such as power plants and oil and gas facilities, experts say. Legal challenges are near certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump called the move “the single largest deregulatory action in American history, by far,” while EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the endangerment finding “the Holy Grail of federal regulatory overreach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top Illinois Democrats, including U.S. Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, joined 47 other Senate Democrats last September to oppose the Trump administration’s effort to roll back the foundational climate rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This disastrous decision reverses decades of progress and ignores decades of legal and scientific precedent, and its negative impacts won’t just be felt immediately, but for generations to come as well,” the U.S. Senate Environmental Justice Caucus, which Duckworth co-chairs, said in a statement. “It’s yet another Trump-created disaster for American families, all to line his billionaire donors’ pocketbooks, as Americans pay the price.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sierra Club filed the original lawsuit that established the scientific finding more than 20 years ago. Jack Darin, director of the Illinois chapter of the environmental advocacy organization, said that state action is more relevant than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Illinois must continue to lead the way,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump called the endangerment finding “one of the greatest scams in history,” claiming falsely that it “had no basis in fact” or law. “On the contrary, over the generations, fossil fuels have saved millions of lives and lifted billions of people out of poverty all over the world,” Trump said at a White House ceremony, although scientists across the globe agree that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are driving catastrophic heat waves and storms, droughts and sea level rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental groups described the move as the single biggest attack in U.S. history against federal authority to address climate change. Evidence backing up the endangerment finding has only grown stronger in the 17 years since it was approved, they said.&lt;br&gt;“This action will only lead to more climate pollution, and that will lead to higher costs and real harms for American families,” said Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense Fund, adding that the consequences would be felt on Americans’ health, property values, water supply and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew Daly is an Associated Press writer.

His average net approval stands at negative 13.7, which is lower than Joe Biden's was at this point in his term. This matters beyond cosmic justice: The president's approval rating is the best predictor of midterm election outcomes. When it falls below 50%, his party tends to lose seats, as in the 1982, 1994, 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the Democratic Party, written off as dead by some a few months ago, stands poised for victory in November. That's good, but not good enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes are so high that a win isn't sufficient to meet the moment. We need a crushing repudiation of this fascistic horror show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easiest issue, perhaps surprisingly, is immigration. Since 2024, Democrats have been snakebit on the subject, afraid that their instinctive pro-immigrant positions were unpopular enough to lead voters to select a snarling villain vowing mass deportations. They can exhale. What the polls over the last year suggest is that most Americans are not white-supremacist goons like Stephen Miller, ready to trash the Constitution in the name of purifying &lt;i&gt;die Volk&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-d10000\" name=\"module-d10000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, voters actually believed that Trump would only deport \"the worst of the worst.\" As they watched the inhuman treatment of gardeners, veterans, children and American citizen protesters, they soured fast. After the shooting of Alex Pretti, fully 60% of respondents told NBC they disapproved of Trump's immigration policies, 49% strongly so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Democrats present themselves as opposing the brutal tactics of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection and favoring firm border controls, they should find themselves in the sweet spot. Messages like Billie Eilish's \"No one is illegal on stolen land\" are unhelpful. By all means, get angry about the savagery; stress that law and order means that first and foremost the state cannot be the lawbreaker. But also add that borders are not notional, and chaos cannot be permitted to prevail along the Rio Grande.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other big issue on voters' minds is inflation, or \"affordability.\" The reality is that politicians cannot actually bring prices down, as Trump promised to do in 2024, except by crashing the economy. Still, some voters presumably believed him, and they are disillusioned now. Some Democrats may be tempted to run on taxing the rich. This is a comfortable old shoe for Democrats, but as a political strategy it hasn't been terribly successful. Middle-class voters often fear that they will be labeled as rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, voters have already concluded that tariffs are making life more expensive. The issue is a layup — if Democrats can get out of their own way. Nearly 60% of Americans blame Trump for rising prices, and 65% disapprove of his tariffs. Fifty-nine percent of independent voters say the tariffs have hurt the economy and their personal finances. Voters are rarely able to connect policy to outcomes, but they have done so in the case of tariffs. Back in 2024, Americans were about equally divided on the question of trade, with some favoring higher tariffs and roughly similar numbers opting for lower tariffs. Experience has changed their views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The progressive wing of the party has long favored tariffs as a way to protect American workers from competition from low-wage nations. This muddies the waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutting tariffs is one of the only levers governments can pull that will actually reduce prices, and since price sensitivity is very much on voters' minds, does it make sense to temper that message at all? All House Democrats voted in favor of a resolution that would end the national emergency excuse for tariffs, and three Republicans joined them. This is the moment. Tariffs are bad — full stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, a vulnerability that Democrats must overcome is seeming to be soft on crime. Here again the Trump administration has handed them a golden opportunity. MAGA is so fixated on ethnic cleansing that it is pulling Justice Department officials off crime-fighting to pursue immigration cases. A memo from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove directed officers who had been working on transnational organized crime, money-laundering and major drug trafficking networks to focus instead on assisting ICE. Ditto for the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces. In fact, about 25% of FBI agents (and 40% in larger field offices) have been diverted from fighting financial crimes, public corruption, cybercrime and complex corporate investigations and pulled into immigration enforcement. Most maddening are the thousands of FBI and Homeland Security agents who've been pulled from investigations of child sex abuse to assist with deportations — as if the administration needed more ways of signaling that it's OK with child sex trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats should stress that the funds appropriated for ICE would be far better deployed to local police departments. Bill Clinton's promise to hire 100,000 police officers was very popular in the '90s and cut against the Democrats' soft-on-crime image. The slogans write themselves: More Cops, Less ICE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The voters are the last redoubt in the fight to reclaim American democracy and decency, and the Democratic Party, the world's oldest political party since the advent of universal suffrage, is the only entity that can carry the burden. If it can win a resounding victory in the House and Senate in nine months, there is hope for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mona Charen is policy editor of The Bulwark and host of the “Beg to Differ” podcast.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-6d0000\" name=\"module-6d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

What do you&amp;nbsp;do to make those who are newly diagnosed feel at ease and optimistic that they can continue to&amp;nbsp;lead independent lives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an optometrist at The Chicago Lighthouse Low Vision Clinic,&amp;nbsp;the oldest of its kind in the Midwest, I listen&amp;nbsp;to our patients’ concerns, making it a point to&amp;nbsp;know&amp;nbsp;them on a personal&amp;nbsp;level and hear how&amp;nbsp;vision loss&amp;nbsp;has impacted their activities at home, work, in retirement and&amp;nbsp;school. Then I offer reassurances that while we might not be able to bring&amp;nbsp;their&amp;nbsp;vision back,&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;can find ways to help patients deal with their challenges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our clinic's comprehensive services and breadth of assistive technology ensure that we have solutions to offer. In addition, all our eye care providers have completed a low vision residency, ensuring that we have the most knowledgeable low vision care providers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren't easily able to access a low vision clinic, online resources can help guide you to&amp;nbsp; assistive devices and technologies that may help. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://mytoolsforliving.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Mytoolsforliving.com&lt;/a&gt; is one such online&amp;nbsp; resource, that can help you find tools to assist in day-to-day activities if you have low&amp;nbsp;vision.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low Vision Awareness Month is also a time for thinking about inclusion. We often take for&amp;nbsp;granted how much of our daily activities rely on good vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading packages, mail, emails, seeing faces, driving where we need to go. Think of the&amp;nbsp;additional challenges posed by not having enough vision to do these things without adequate accommodations and accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to remember people with low vision when designing packaging, products and other&amp;nbsp;items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inclusion of people with any disability is important, and Low Vision Awareness Month is a great&amp;nbsp; time to remind everyone about the power of inclusivity and accessibility for all, including those&amp;nbsp; living with low vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicagolighthouse.org/leadership/kara-h-crumbliss/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Kara Crumbliss&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, chief, clinical services, The Chicago Lighthouse&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-ed0000\" name=\"module-ed0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Give us your take&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;Send letters to the editor to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

The AP and Sun-Times are so obsessed with being \"woke\" and politically correct, the team was continually referred to in the story as \"Washington.\" The team couldn't be referred to as the Commanders since Sonny never played for the Commanders. The team name was changed in 2022. You cannot rewrite history. Please be factual. He played for the Redskins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ray Miller, Olympia Fields&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

He admitted to one affair but swears he saw her only twice and they had sex only once. He says I'm imagining the other two. He hasn't apologized for the one he admitted to and refuses to discuss it or the other two, though I can see them in my mind's eye and feel it in my gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, I'm more angry about his lying than I am about something that happened decades ago. Am I wrong to want the truth so I can get angry, deal with it and then forgive him? I also want a heartfelt apology. — &lt;i&gt;HEARTSICK IN TEXAS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR HEARTSICK:&lt;/b&gt; You do not need \"the truth\" so you can get angry. You are ALREADY as mad as heck. What you want is an apology from your cheating husband, and you aren't going to get it. Discussing this with a licensed marriage and family therapist may help you dissipate some of your anger and move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; Two of my mom's best friends ended their friendship with her after almost 50 years because of political differences. I grew up spending every holiday with these ladies and their families, in addition to summer lake and winter ski vacations and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of them is my godmother, and they both were like second moms to me. Can it be that simple to act as if they were never friends in the first place? Must Mom just accept the change, or can she try to repair the friendships? — &lt;i&gt;SAD SON IN CALIFORNIA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR SON:&lt;/b&gt; When political differences run so deep that close friendships are destroyed, I am sorry to say they are often not salvageable. I am not sure that time can heal the rift when someone is so entrenched in their political beliefs that they would jettison a 50-year friendship. Suggest to your mom that rather than look backward, she may try to cultivate friends who are less contentious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; I am a 75-year-old therapist who was virtually a single parent. I still struggle with the guilt that I didn't do a good enough job with my three grown children, despite my trying with what energy and resources I continue to have. Their father has been pretty much absent since our divorce 35 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can I get rid of the feeling that I am disrespected by my ungrateful adult children, and how do I stop trying to compensate them for their missing parent? There is minimal chance that they will change their attitude or beliefs at this point. — &lt;i&gt;STRUGGLING IN NEW JERSEY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR STRUGGLING:&lt;/b&gt; Thank you for asking. By now you must have realized that you can't buy love. As a psychotherapist, surely you are aware that therapists have therapists of their own (and many need this support). Because you are in pain over something you can't change by yourself, recognize that it's time to become proactive on your own behalf and consult one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Property tax bills have gone out late, causing school districts across the region to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2025/12/19/property-tax-payment-delay-costs-chicago-public-schools-almost-a-quarter-million-dollars-a-day\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;take out loans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with interest, as they waited to collect their share of property taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While my opponent has had a great career in public service, she’s stayed a bit too long,” Reilly said. “Cook County government is broken in a number of areas that are making it a lot less affordable to be able to live here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reilly said he would terminate the county’s contract with Tyler Technologies, which has been working to upgrade the technology behind the property tax system for years, if needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preckwinkle countered she’s one of several separately elected officials who oversee a complicated tax system. Other elected officials, such as the county assessor and treasurer, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/what-to-know-democratic-primary-cook-county-assessor-fritz-kaegi-pat-hynes\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;determine property values&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2025/11/18/cook-county-treasurer-maria-pappas-mayoral-campaign-chicago-brandon-johnson\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;mail tax bills&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My view has been to try to get people to work together to solve the problems,” Preckwinkle said. “You can’t do that if you point fingers and throw people under the bus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-9a0000\" name=\"image-9a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0dd08e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6553x3678+0+347/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fb8%2Fbd8f18ff4322a669b5ea9c3c0b4c%2Fmasstransit-121725-018.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fe635ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6553x3678+0+347/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fb8%2Fbd8f18ff4322a669b5ea9c3c0b4c%2Fmasstransit-121725-018.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8db14f5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6553x3678+0+347/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fb8%2Fbd8f18ff4322a669b5ea9c3c0b4c%2Fmasstransit-121725-018.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle listens to Gov.

She hasn’t raised the county’s portion of property taxes during her 16-year tenure, though a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://news.wttw.com/2017/10/16/toni-preckwinkle-soda-tax-repeal-county-budget-shortfall\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;soda tax she supported years ago was repealed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after a huge backlash. The county’s pension fund is funded around 66%, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.civicfed.org/dashboard/localgovtpensions\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;more than double&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; some of the city’s pension funds. The county has received four bond rating upgrades since 2021, while Chicago is mired in debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preckwinkle underscores that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2025/12/19/chicago-city-council-approves-alternate-revenue-plan-minus-mayor-brandon-johnsons-corporate-head-tax\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Reilly and a group&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of conservative and moderate alders recently muscled through a Chicago budget that includes a host of tax hikes, including a property tax increase for Chicago public libraries. While the budget avoided a new tax on the city’s largest corporations, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/city-hall/2025/12/12/corporate-head-tax-brandon-johnson-2026-proposed-budget-job-killer-claim\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;detested by Chicago’s business community&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it “puts the burden entirely on taxpayers while exempting labor from any shared burden,” and included “only a handful of efficiencies and cost savings,” the Civic Federation, a non-partisan government watchdog, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://civicfed.org/chicagos-fy2026-adopted-budget\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote in an analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly $5 billion of the city’s $16.6 billion budget this year will go toward pension and debt payments, after decades of mismanagement. That burden contributed to a nearly $1.2 billion gap between revenue and expenses in 2026, as the city has limited avenues to raise money aside from property tax and fee hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preckwinkle is a former history teacher and longtime Chicago alderperson representing the South Side before she was elected county board president in 2010. She uses her political power and progressive values to shape how the county spends money. She has championed &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/cook-county/2025/04/08/cook-county-leaders-are-touting-the-success-of-their-guaranteed-income-pilot-program\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;guaranteed income &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;for low to moderate income residents, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/health-medicine/2025/06/05/cook-county-erases-nearly-665-million-in-medical-debt-for-more-than-a-half-million-residents\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;erased more than $600 million of medical debt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and helped &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/the-end-of-cash-bail-in-illinois\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;eliminate cash bail&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Illinois. She has mentored many into higher office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reilly got his start in public service in the 1990s and worked as an aide to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/politics/2025/02/13/what-former-illinois-house-speaker-michael-madigans-conviction-means-for-his-legacy\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;now-convicted &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan. He left for the private sector and worked as an AT&amp;amp;T executive before defeating long-serving City Council incumbent, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/6/11/21288690/former-downtown-ald-burt-natarus-dies-council-obituary-carriages-valet-street-musicians\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Burt Natarus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reilly hasn’t faced an opponent since. In 2020, he &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2020/10/27/21537277/alderman-brendan-reilly-states-attorney-kim-foxx-republican-pat-obrien-cook-county\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;broke with the Democratic Party&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to endorse Republican Patrick O’Brien over Kim Foxx, Preckwinkle’s former chief of staff, for Cook County state’s attorney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preckwinkle runs again because of Trump&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preckwinkle said she was inspired to run for a fifth, four-year term to guard against Republican President Donald Trump. His One Big Beautiful Bill calls for &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.kff.org/medicaid/allocating-cbos-estimates-of-federal-medicaid-spending-reductions-across-the-states-enacted-reconciliation-package/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;sweeping cuts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to public programs that support thousands of county residents, and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/politics/2025/05/23/how-medicaid-cuts-from-congress-could-affect-every-cook-county-resident\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;could put a big dent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the overall county budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As immigration agents detained people off the streets and fired &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/21/judge-hands-down-critical-review-of-federal-immigration-agents-unprecedented-use-of-force\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;pepper balls and tear gas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at protesters throughout Chicago and the suburbs, she issued an &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/16/preckwinkle-issues-executive-order-to-create-ice-free-zones-in-cook-county\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;executive order&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to create “ICE-free zones” in Cook County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Trump’s declared war on us,” Preckwinkle said. “We need somebody who’s going to stand up to him and stand for our residents and the rule of law. He’s not that man,” she said of Reilly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She points to his support for a measure aimed at creating carveouts in Chicago’s sanctuary law that prohibit police from helping with civil immigration enforcement. Reilly was one of 11 Council members who pushed for a vote on the now-stalled measure, after a chorus of advocacy organizations &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/01/10/donald-trump-deportation-plan-ice-immigration-advocates-chicago-police\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;warned it&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; would open the door to constitutional rights violations and legal challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Reilly said he supports abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and returning the agency to its “core functions during the Obama administration.” He said he would defend the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cookcountyil.gov/news/president-preckwinkle-signs-executive-order-banning-use-cook-county-owned-property-and\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;county’s restrictions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on using local resources for certain federal immigration enforcement. But he supports carveouts for people arrested or convicted for felonies such as sex crimes involving children or gang-related violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges the county faces is bracing for an estimated almost $300 million in losses per year, largely due to people losing their health insurance. Low-income residents who have public Medicaid health insurance will have &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://hfs.illinois.gov/info/fedresctr/medicaidfedpolicychfs.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;new work requirements&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; next year and more frequent checks to make sure they qualify, while others might drop insurance they bought on the government exchanges because &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/health-subsidies-expire-launching-millions-of-americans-into-2026-with-steep-insurance-hikes\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;subsidies are gone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People might still show up for medical care at Cook County Health’s two hospitals and several clinics, but might not be able to afford to pay what could be big bills. That means less money flowing to the county. The majority of the county’s patients have Medicaid or no insurance, records show. Dr. Erik Mikaitis, CEO of CCH, said the amount of uninsured patients is already swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reilly said the county should have planned for Medicaid losses earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t wait for federal cuts to happen,” Reilly said. “You build a firewall before they hit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;County leaders say they have been preparing. The health system started tightening its belt last year, with 10% cuts across all departments that will continue through 2026. They froze about 200 vacant positions. The county has set aside around $320 million in reserves, partly in case federal grants for everything from transportation to public health get cut, and nearly $70 million for potential Medicaid losses, a county spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reilly suggests pre-ranking medical services to keep or cut, prioritizing the ER and trauma care. He declined to say what he would cut, deferring to the health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mikaitis said there are contingency plans — not cutting services but potentially consolidating them, such as offering a service in three clinics instead of five.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reilly suggests a Cook County ID&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Reilly said he wants to make sure “Cook County services are for Cook County residents,” and that the county isn’t absorbing costs from other counties. He points to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/politics/2020/03/12/treating-uninsured-patients-is-wreaking-havoc-on-cook-county-finances\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;WBEZ reporting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that underscores the impact on county finances for providing the most charity care, or discounted care, of any hospital in Illinois — around $217 million at the county’s John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital in 2024, a WBEZ analysis of the most recent &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://hfsrb.illinois.gov/inventories-data.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;state records&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows. In some cases, private hospitals stabilize patients, then refer them to the county for follow-up care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Verified residency and referral data would allow the county and the Attorney General to audit community benefit reports, enforce state discount laws, and hold private systems accountable when costs are shifted onto the public safety net,” Reilly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A health system spokeswoman said only about 4% of patients live outside the county. The county’s financial assistance program, CareLink, is only for county residents, and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://healthcarereportcard.illinois.gov/hospital-uninsured-patient-discount-act\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;an Illinois law&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; caps how much any hospital can collect from uninsured patients who live in the state. Patients who live outside of Illinois and pay out of pocket could qualify for a discount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reilly said a countywide ID, which county commissioners have &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2017/7/5/18342498/two-cook-county-commissioners-proposing-county-i-d-card\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;floated before&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, would help people prove residency for county services, such as medical care. The idea is not to restrict care or duplicate existing ID programs, like Chicago’s CityKey, Reilly said. The county ID would be for suburban residents, he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoever wins the Democratic primary would likely win in the November general election. There is &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cookcountyclerkil.gov/elections/results-and-election-data/election-results/candidate-filing\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;no Republican candidate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for county board president. Michael Murphy is running as a Libertarian. Preckwinkle last won with about 69% of the vote in 2022 against Bob Fioretti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should she win, Preckwinkle said it would be her last term as county board president. She said she also plans to run for just one more, two-year term this spring to lead the Democratic Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kristen Schorsch and Mariah Woelfel cover government for WBEZ.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

And she said her partners didn't want to continue the company, fearful that technological advancements in creating virtual models would ultimately eat away their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"They are concerned that because of the digital revolution, there's not enough work or physical models anymore,\" she said. \"It's difficult. We're cleaning out the shop.

Daley, attempting to show progress, would hold news conferences standing before impressive scale models of a proposed central area with new high-rises and development from 18th Street to North Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the decades, the models were our first look at many well-known projects around town from Crown Hall at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Marina City, Sears Tower, Central Station, the Harold Washington Library entries, Millennium Park and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's less so now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-250000\" name=\"image-250000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a75a150/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3765x2113+0+277/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe6%2F1cfe7262465caeadea2e7a7017d5%2Fimg-0913.jpeg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2384b64/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3765x2113+0+277/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe6%2F1cfe7262465caeadea2e7a7017d5%2Fimg-0913.jpeg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7a7792d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3765x2113+0+277/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe6%2F1cfe7262465caeadea2e7a7017d5%2Fimg-0913.jpeg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Former President Barack Obama examines a model of the Obama Presidential Center campus made by Columbian Model &amp;amp; Exhibit Works.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7a7792d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3765x2113+0+277/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe6%2F1cfe7262465caeadea2e7a7017d5%2Fimg-0913.jpeg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b5658d4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3765x2113+0+277/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe6%2F1cfe7262465caeadea2e7a7017d5%2Fimg-0913.jpeg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7a7792d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3765x2113+0+277/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe4%2Fe6%2F1cfe7262465caeadea2e7a7017d5%2Fimg-0913.jpeg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former President Barack Obama examines a model of the Obama Presidential Center campus made by Columbian Model &amp;amp; Exhibit Works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provided by the Obama Foundation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to tech advancements, Tinker said a tepid Chicago real estate market has caused fewer developers to pay for large models needed to attract buyers and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Model making is also exacting work that requires materials and textures that can mimic the look of steel, brick and stone, while working with an architect to get the scale, color and details just right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It has to tell the story that the developer or [whomever] is trying to tell,\" Columbian Model Senior Designer Bill Bauman said. \"But it's at a smaller scale, so the detail has to be finessed. So that you still get the idea without making it identical to full size.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a line of work Tinker fell into by chance 35 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former trial attorney, she got introduced to model making when she got legal exhibits made for court cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She represented Morton Thiokol in a case against the NASA contractor, following the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger tragedy. That's when the spacecraft exploded 73 seconds after liftoff when its rocket booster O-rings failed. The shuttle's seven crew members were killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We actually got little models of the O-ring made that we shipped over to England so that we could explain the case to the guys from Lloyd's [of London insurance company] because they were the ones that ultimately were paying for everything,\" Tinker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinker said she turned to the model-making business after getting \"burned out\" with the legal profession — despite having no experience fabricating the objects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Originally, I was going to make trial exhibits,\" she said. \"But then the architectural model-making part just sort of grew organically.

It's updated every few months by Columbian Model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Architecture Center Chief Marketing Officer Lauren Bakos said, \"It made me sad,\" when she heard the shop was closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I understand that technology has made it easier to do things digitally and use augmented reality and all of that,\" she said. \"But to show off these structures that are being developed in Chicago, I think it's a really beautiful art. And it's sad that it's kind of a dying one.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakos said the company left the CAC with a few models to plug into the big exhibit, including one of the revamped Thompson Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"So we're on the hunt for someone else who can take over that project,\" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Columbian Model is looking for a new home for all its work. Bauman said the company has thrown away some of its models, including a few of the Lakeshore East towers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We've lost a lot them, but we still we have a dozen or so,\" Bauman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tinker said, \"There are smaller models that were on shelves that I need find to homes find for.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

Novelists are writing everything from hot hockey stories to steamy football fantasies. Enthusiasm is even spilling over into real life, with &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment-and-culture/2023/11/13/23953363/last-chapter-book-shop-chicago-romance-novels-bookstore-roscoe-village\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;The Last Chapter Book Shop&lt;/a&gt; in Roscoe Village organizing a romance novelist meet-and-greet paired with an outing to a Blackhawks game next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm glad that this genre is getting its moment in the sun,” Carmichael said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bellwood writer Nicole Falls, who centers Black characters in her books, said fans of the genre enjoy the high stakes involved in both sports and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are obstacles that you have to surpass for each,\" said Falls, whose catalog features two sports romance series, \"Nymphs &amp;amp; Trojans\" and \"New Beginnings.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"You're communicating when things are good and bad. The best relationships are based on very good communication.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A genre pioneer creates a fictional Chicago NFL team &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The momentum around sports romance started to build decades ago, according to Phillips, who is recognized as a pioneer of the genre. In 1994, she launched her “Chicago Stars” series, named for a fictional professional football team whose players, coaches and staffers — and the people they love — have fueled 11 books. The latest, “And the Crowd Went Wild\" (HarperCollins), was released on Feb. 10. It follows a former Hollywood star and a hotshot quarterback who rekindle their romance in an old railcar in the woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillips said readers will be drawn in by the “snarky, fun dialogue” and ups and downs of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love a book where readers are going to laugh and then they're going to get tears in their eyes,” she said. “We've got two lost people who need each other very much, but they're not going to show it. And we also have a dog. It's always good to have a dog.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-580000\" name=\"image-580000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f96a063/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3150x1768+0+1482/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6e%2Fa5%2Fda4f864e47dab217fd26c8215859%2Fsep-author-photo-credit-chandra-wicke-photography.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1b7f4a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3150x1768+0+1482/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6e%2Fa5%2Fda4f864e47dab217fd26c8215859%2Fsep-author-photo-credit-chandra-wicke-photography.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72519c6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3150x1768+0+1482/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6e%2Fa5%2Fda4f864e47dab217fd26c8215859%2Fsep-author-photo-credit-chandra-wicke-photography.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"SEP author photo - credit Chandra Wicke Photography.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72519c6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3150x1768+0+1482/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6e%2Fa5%2Fda4f864e47dab217fd26c8215859%2Fsep-author-photo-credit-chandra-wicke-photography.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/086902e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3150x1768+0+1482/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6e%2Fa5%2Fda4f864e47dab217fd26c8215859%2Fsep-author-photo-credit-chandra-wicke-photography.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72519c6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3150x1768+0+1482/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F6e%2Fa5%2Fda4f864e47dab217fd26c8215859%2Fsep-author-photo-credit-chandra-wicke-photography.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pioneer in the sports romance genre, Naperville author Susan Elizabeth Phillips has written 11 books in the “Chicago Stars” series. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chandra Wicke Photography&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillips' readers have also become engaged in the saga of the Chicago Stars. In the books, the author writes them as crosstown rivals of the Chicago Bears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My Stars have won either four or five Super Bowls, and the Bears have only won one,” she said. “My Stars are in a bit of a slump right now, but they'll recover. They always do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillips has been inspiring other writers to create their own sports-based love stories since she published the first \"Chicago Stars\" novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Within the next few years, I remember seeing a baseball book and another football book, and it just kept progressing,” she said. “In the last 10 years, we've had wrestling and roller derby and a bunch of hockey books long before ‘Heated Rivalry.’ Sports romance has been going strong for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Supercharging the queer romance space &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the steamy \"Heated Rivalry\" series will, no doubt, bolster the market for romance novels, said Jen Prokop, of Hyde Park, who co-hosts the \"&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/books/2024/11/18/romance-books-best-2024-fated-mates-podcast-chicago-bookstores\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Fated Mates&lt;/a&gt;\" romance novel podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully it will also supercharge the queer romance space,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, queer romances in media often ended in death or some other form of tragedy, Prokop said. Bucking that trend is part of why \"Heated Rivalry\" was so successful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Embracing the radical idea that queer people deserve to find happiness and joy and love, and that that can be publicly celebrated, is the story of ‘Heated Rivalry,'\" she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It’s also what romance does best. It shows that you don't have to have a perfect life. Society doesn't have to be perfect. But people are going to fall in love and try to create happiness together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By writing \"The Kennedy Rule\" and planning more books in the series, K.C. Carmichael is helping to fill those gaps. She also published another LGBTQ+ romance, \"300 New Year's Eves\" (Rising Action) in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I used to be a fantasy and dystopian reader, but that got to be really heavy,” Carmichael said. “Eventually romance caught me because it's fun.

What went up, mostly didn’t come down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Chicago’s largest grocery chain Jewel-Osco, 18 items went up in price, 15 stayed the same and two — Land O’ Lakes butter and Doritos nacho cheese chips — dropped by 50 cents and 80 cents, respectively, over the past 13 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With most items going up in price, it meant our shopping cart at Jewel went up by a total of $21.80 — from $263.15 on Jan. 7, 2025, to $284.95 on Feb. 3, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump famously said during his 2024 campaign he’d get prices down “starting on Day One” of his presidency. And high grocery prices played an out-sized role in the presidential election, with many voters saying they were “very concerned” about food costs, according to a 2024 survey by the Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edgewater resident Lena Howard, 30, said she doesn’t need hard data to know that groceries are expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everything is expensive — the milk, the eggs, the cereal,” Howard, a mother of two boys, aged 10 and 8, said as she loaded groceries into her car at a North Side Jewel. “For a box of cereal, they want damn near $10.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howard said she spends about $250 a week on food and household items. To stretch her budget, she cooks at home, except on Fridays, and makes big batches of spaghetti and chicken Alfredo that can be repurposed for lunches or kept in the freezer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She usually shops at Jewel because it’s close to her home but sometimes she makes the half-hour drive to a Walmart in Skokie, where prices are lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Walmart, many of the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/07/18/supermarket-super-pain-trump-campaign-food-prices-inflation-tariffs\"   &gt;35 items on our list&lt;/a&gt; dropped in price more often than they rose, compared to one year ago. Seventeen items went down totaling $9.60 in savings, seven items increased totaling $5.81, seven stayed the same and four didn’t have enough data to be tracked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prices of our items at Mariano’s and Target mostly increased or stayed flat. A grand total for the baskets couldn’t be made because not every item was available each month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Mariano’s, 14 items stayed the same in price, 13 went up, six went down and two did not have enough data. At Target, 19 items went up, 10 went down, five stayed the same and one didn’t have enough data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grocery expert Phil Lempert, known as the “Supermarket Guru,” said the truth is price increases that slammed consumers beginning in mid-2022 are mostly not going away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climate change is affecting crops and cattle, tariffs are hitting imports and messing up farming forecasts and immigration enforcement is impacting labor, Lempert said. And the large publicly-owned food and consumer product companies are under pressure to deliver growth for their stockholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It puts the consumer in a really difficult position because there’s not a lot we can do,” Lempert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jewel and Mariano’s, as well as their parent companies Albertsons and Kroger, respectively, didn’t respond to requests for comment. A Target spokeswoman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the products whose prices rose from January 2025 to February 2026 include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-f7a844a2-084d-11f1-99ee-413f9fa0de1f\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Folgers ground coffee:&lt;/b&gt; Jumped in price at all four stores. At Jewel and Mariano’s, prices rose 38.5%, from $6.49 in January 2025 to $8.99 in February 2026. At Target, it increased from $6.29 to $8.49, up 35%, and at Walmart, the price increased 20.6%,from $5.78 to $6.97. Coffee prices are up nationwide due to poor harvests globally, as well as lingering effects from tariffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nathan’s Famous bun-length hot dogs:&lt;/b&gt; Increased in price at all four stores. At Jewel, the price climbed from $6.49 to $8.49, a 30.8% increase. The price at Mariano’s went from $6.49 to $7.99.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ground beef:&lt;/b&gt; Over the past year, prices rose 25% at Jewel and Walmart. Price increases nationwide are blamed on drought, smaller herd sizes and increased costs for cattle feed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;M&amp;amp;M’s peanut candy:&lt;/b&gt; An 18.08-ounce bag cost more at Jewel, Mariano’s and Target, with the price at Jewel hitting a whopping $13.99, up 27.3% from $10.99 in January 2025.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Oreo:&lt;/b&gt; Prices for an 18.12-ounce package also increased at Jewel, Mariano’s and Target. It reached $7.49 this month at Jewel, up from $6.99 in January 2025. At Mariano’s, it was $7.39, up from $6.49.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coke:&lt;/b&gt; A 12-pack cost more at all four stores. The price was $9.99 in January 2025 at Jewel and Mariano’s, and increased 20% to $11.99 this month.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Always:&lt;/b&gt; A package of the feminine product rose at all four stores. At Jewel, a 46-count box jumped from $9.49 in January 2025 to $11.99 this month, a 26.3% increase.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pampers Swaddlers:&lt;/b&gt; A box of 84 size 2 diapers went up Jewel, Mariano’s and Target, with the biggest increase at Mariano’s, up 9.4% from $31.99 to $34.99.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egg prices hit a breaking point for many consumers early last year, when avian flu decimated farms and caused prices to skyrocket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sun-Times tracked Eggland's Best grade-A large white eggs, as well as individual store brands and recorded a peak in March 2025, when a dozen eggs of Eggland’s Best hit $9.49 at Mariano’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those super-high prices have largely dropped now that the bird flu crisis is less of a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, Eggland’s Best eggs were $5.99 at Jewel; $5.49 at Mariano’s for a dozen large eggs; and $3.96 for extra-large eggs at Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Store brand eggs were as low as $1.99 at Target and $1.97 at Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shrinkflation’s double-whammy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tide original liquid laundry detergent rose in price at two of the four stores we checked. It also shrunk in size by 4 ounces over the course of 13 months to 80 ounces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henry Molski, spokesperson for Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, manufacturer of Tide, said the amount is less but the detergent is still able to clean the same 64 loads of laundry advertised on the label — assuming loads of 6 pounds — because it was reformulated at a higher concentration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tide continues to concentrate to provide a superior cleaning experience. In fact, Tide made its biggest upgrade in liquid in over 20 years with the Tide boosted formula in the fall of ‘25,” Molski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e60000\" name=\"image-e60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/31a415e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6547x3674+0+139/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F97%2Fb79ae05f4734b9868a53c1ad91bb%2Ftide-comp.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d48b9d7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6547x3674+0+139/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F97%2Fb79ae05f4734b9868a53c1ad91bb%2Ftide-comp.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/835b711/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6547x3674+0+139/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F97%2Fb79ae05f4734b9868a53c1ad91bb%2Ftide-comp.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Two bottles of Tide laundry detergent next to each other\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/835b711/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6547x3674+0+139/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F97%2Fb79ae05f4734b9868a53c1ad91bb%2Ftide-comp.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7a98149/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6547x3674+0+139/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F97%2Fb79ae05f4734b9868a53c1ad91bb%2Ftide-comp.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/835b711/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6547x3674+0+139/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F31%2F97%2Fb79ae05f4734b9868a53c1ad91bb%2Ftide-comp.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tide liquid laundry detergent shrunk in volume from 84 ounces (left) to 80 ounces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun-Times file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tide was $14.99 at Jewel in January 2025, and it's now $15.99. At Target, it went from $12.99 for an 84-ounce bottle to $13.69 for 80 ounces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edgar Dworsky, founder of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.consumerworld.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;ConsumerWorld.org&lt;/a&gt; and a former assistant attorney general for Massachusetts, was one of the first to spot the smaller size of Tide and said many consumers won’t realize they need to use less detergent per load to get the same 64 loads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said shrinking products pop up everywhere from toilet paper rolls, with a few less sheets, to a cereal box that stays the same height but gets narrower and bottles that get tapered or dimpled so they hold less liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"ActionBox Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n\n    &lt;div class=\"ActionBox-content\"&gt;\n      \n        &lt;div class=\"ActionBox-title\"&gt;What are you seeing at the grocery store? &lt;/div&gt;\n      \n\n      \n        &lt;div class=\"ActionBox-description\"&gt;Tell your story to reporter Stephanie Zimmermann.&lt;/div&gt;\n      \n    &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    \n      &lt;div class=\"ActionBox-cta\"&gt;\n          &lt;a class=\"Button\" href=\"mailto:szimmermann@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\" &gt;Email me&lt;/a&gt;\n      &lt;/div&gt;\n   \n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the price stays the same on a shrinking product, the consumer loses money. When the price increases on a smaller version, it’s a double-whammy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shrinking products were more prevalent a few years ago, when inflation was higher, Dworsky said. Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, as the world emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shrinkflation, downsizing has been around forever, and it’s not going anywhere, but we see it in waves,” he said. “At the moment, it’s fairly even.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers can guard against &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/consumer-affairs/2025/11/15/paying-more-smaller-restaurant-grocery-portions-shrinkflation\"   &gt;shrinkflation&lt;/a&gt; by paying attention to what's in the package, whether it's by weight or by count, of the products they regularly purchase, Dworsky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because he tracks the prices of items he regularly buys, it helps him recognize when a sale is worth it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you recognize a good deal, load up on that item,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tracking sales&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sun-Times tracked shelf prices, but also the sale prices when the deal was for a single item that didn’t require a mobile app or loyalty program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some sales were significant. For example, those eye-popping $13.99 bag of peanut M&amp;amp;M’s at Jewel were on sale in February for $8.99 — no coupon required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with some items we followed, the cost climbed so high that the promotional price exceeded the old shelf price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, a 1-pound package of 85% lean ground beef at Jewel was on sale for $6.99 this month, $1 more than the shelf price from January 2025. The sale price this month for Folgers coffee was $8.49, which was $2 more than its shelf price of $6.49 in January 2025. We also saw this trend with Oreo cookies, Tropicana orange juice and Always pads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A New York Times/Siena poll released last month found that while a majority of Americans said they’re able to afford basics like rent, gas and groceries, close to 60% are concerned about rising costs and only 14% said they’re able to get ahead financially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Art Friedson, of Lake View, caught a glimpse of consumers' anxiety in November. While in line at the supermarket, he saw an older couple and an “unbelievably patient” cashier spend several minutes leafing through the store’s flyer and checking its mobile app to find a coupon for one of the handful of items they were purchasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple's grand total was only $7.01. “You don’t do that unless you really, really need those extra couple of pennies,” Friedson said. “That’s how things are in a supermarket these days. It’s heartbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many consumers treat sales and coupons as an integral part of their shopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Serafini, of Grayslake, said he won’t set foot in Jewel without checking the store’s ads and downloading digital coupons off Jewel’s mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retired computer programmer said he’s found some decent deals, like four boxes of cereal for $8, though he always checks his receipt to make sure the digital coupons were applied and tells customer service if they weren’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his real savings strategy is going to Woodman’s Markets, where the prices are often lower. He’ll also go to Menards, which despite being known for selling home improvement and hardware items also stocks many grocery products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Menards, Serafini shops during the store’s rebate periods then mails his receipts to get an in-store rebate coupon, equal to 11% of what he spent. He then uses those coupons to buy more items on his shopping list. He recently got close to $40 in free groceries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s worth it,” Serafini said. ”To me, it’s a no brainer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-480000\" name=\"module-480000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ways to save&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul id=\"rte-67c528e2-0856-11f1-8b6f-937da1d85873\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plan ahead by creating weekly meal plans and batch-cook foods that can be frozen or eaten as leftovers and lunches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Always shop with a list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Check for store sales in advance. If your go-to store has an app, consider downloading it to clip digital coupons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stock up, if you can, when sales are good. But if you see a sale that requires you to buy multiples of a product, compare the unit price to make sure it’s truly a great deal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose a store’s private label brand, which is often just as good as the brand-name product but often 25% cheaper. Aldi and Trader Joe’s are two grocers known for selling products under their own brands at lower prices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat less meat and add more beans, lentils and other legumes to your diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-af0000\" name=\"module-af0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-6a0000\" name=\"image-6a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/53508ee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4041x2268+0+322/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe3%2F40%2Fe59d81cb473bb5b2682b884f349d%2Fgroceryprices-all-groceries-v1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3bae980/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4041x2268+0+322/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe3%2F40%2Fe59d81cb473bb5b2682b884f349d%2Fgroceryprices-all-groceries-v1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bb88bd2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4041x2268+0+322/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe3%2F40%2Fe59d81cb473bb5b2682b884f349d%2Fgroceryprices-all-groceries-v1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Grocery items that the Sun-Times has tracked.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bb88bd2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4041x2268+0+322/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe3%2F40%2Fe59d81cb473bb5b2682b884f349d%2Fgroceryprices-all-groceries-v1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/68432b5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4041x2268+0+322/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe3%2F40%2Fe59d81cb473bb5b2682b884f349d%2Fgroceryprices-all-groceries-v1.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bb88bd2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4041x2268+0+322/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe3%2F40%2Fe59d81cb473bb5b2682b884f349d%2Fgroceryprices-all-groceries-v1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grocery items that the Sun-Times has tracked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Ernst/Sun-Times file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How we’re tracking grocery prices&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Chicago Sun-Times has been tracking the shelf and sale prices for 35 items, from staples like milk, bread and eggs to fresh produce, meats and frozen food as well as coffee, cookies and candy. We’ve also tracked products like shampoo, diapers, detergent and toilet paper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We decided to choose packaged items from well-known manufacturers such as Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, Kraft Heinz, Tyson Foods, Hormel, Smithfield Foods, Nestle, Mars, Mondelez, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, General Mills and Unilever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prices skyrocketed in mid-2022, under former President Joe Biden’s administration and following the COVID-19 pandemic. The high cost of groceries played a large role in the 2024 presidential campaign, in which then-candidate Donald Trump repeatedly promised to lower grocery prices.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our price data is from the first Tuesday of each month and was tracked in person and online at Jewel, as well as online at Mariano’s, Target and Walmart, using the same store locations each time. These stores were chosen for their large footprint in Chicago and because most of our items were available at all four.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Comparisons are made with shelf prices to remove the variability of occasional sales.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-500000\" name=\"html-embed-module-500000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-quiz\" data-src=\"visualisation/27515435\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27515435/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"quiz visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/07/18/supermarket-super-pain-trump-campaign-food-prices-inflation-tariffs\"   &gt;We’re tracking grocery prices around Chicago since Trump took office.

Caught by an Illinois sheriff \"in sympathy with the slave owners,\" Gray was being returned to bondage. A crowd awaited him, including a local merchant named John Hossack, an immigrant from Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"What crime has he committed?\" Hossack shouted. \"Has he done anything but want to be free?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A question that echoes through the years and across the country today. With federal immigration agents this past year prowling Democratic cities — Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis — kidnapping Latino individuals  and dragging them off to exile, and billions being pumped into immigration enforcement, gearing up to grab more people and confine them to enormous facilities now being constructed nationwide, it's impossible not to think of the Fugitive Slave Act, the 1850 law that also created a federal force tasked with snaring people for the crime of wanting to live in freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-460000\" name=\"module-460000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Opinion bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was already a law, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, empowering owners to retrieve their chattel from the North. But Southerners were upset that California was being admitted to the union as a free state. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was a sop to them, meting out punishment  to anyone helping Blacks escape slavery, and creating monetary incentives for agents bringing escapees back. The law gave bite to the slave drivers' bark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then as now, local communities fiercely resisted this federal intrusion into their constitutional rights. Then as now, street clashes erupted as national law and human decency faced off against each other. This being February — Black History Month — and with the Trump administration waging war on Black History, scrubbing it from the Smithsonian, from college campuses and federal websites in an attempt to declare the civil rights struggle an unmentionable blot upon enforced patriotic zeal, it seemed important to explore the subject in depth, while we still enjoy the right to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"All historical analogies are the same,\" said Matthew Pinsker, a history professor and director of the House Divided Project at Dickinson College. \"There's always some similarities and plenty of differences. This is a battle between the national administration and blue state governments. In the Fugitive Slave days, it was a battle between Washington and Northern states, which passed laws called 'personal liberty laws' that were like the sanctuary city laws that Trump is trying to overturn.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/photography/2025/12/18/midway-blitz-chicago-immigration-raids-photography-photos\"   &gt;The most pivotal moments of Operation Midway Blitz, captured by Sun-Times photographers&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Ottawa residents showed up for Gray's hearing the next day in the courtroom of Justice Dean Caton, who ruled that while Gray had broken no Illinois law, the Fugitive Slave Act demanded he go to Springfield to face charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray never got there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a marshal began to lead Gray from the courthouse, local men sprang into action. The officer was restrained, while Hossack grabbed Gray by the elbow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If you want liberty, run!\" Hossack urged, dragging Gray from the courthouse. They jumped a fence, climbed into a waiting carriage, and were sped out of town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray escaped north to Canada.

Strong then, strong now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act was particularly strong in Chicago, the city \"a sinkhole of abolition\" in the words of one downstate editor. A hub of actual railroads, it was also a center for the Underground Railroad, an informal confederation hurrying those escaping slavery north to Canada. When a slave catcher arrived at Chicago in October, 1850, he was informed that his safety could not be guaranteed, and the enslaved servant he had brought with him was helped to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same month, the Chicago Common Council — predecessor of the City Council — passed a law condemning the Fugitive Slave Act as \"cruel and unjust\" and ordering the police force — nine men at the time — \"not to render any assistance for the arrest of fugitive slaves.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncannily similar to the challenge Mayor Brandon Johnson would face 175 years later: how much cooperation must local government give to federal authorities enforcing a despised and unjust law? The council in 1850 minced no words, damning any free state representatives supporting the bill as \"fit only to be ranked with the traitors, Benedict Arnold, and Judas Iscariot who betrayed his Lord and master for thirty pieces of silver.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last October, the City Council passed a similar, if less florid, resolution, focused on trying to protect children from traumatic seizure by ICE agents and urging citizens to report the misconduct they witness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was motivating Chicago to push back against the Fugitive Slave Act? While its tempting to just superimpose Chicago's current sanctuary city liberalism onto the mid-19th century city, that wasn't the case. There were only 323 Black people living in Chicago in 1850 — about 1% of the population. Illinois had passed its own \"Black Laws\" in 1848, forbidding the immigration of free Blacks into the state and, as amended in 1853, forbidding Black visitors from spending more than 10 nights in the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"These protectors of fugitive slaves raised no objection to the exclusion of Negro testimony against a white person in the courts of law,\" historian Bessie Louise Pierce noted in 1940. \"They seemed to see no inconsistencies in providing a separate section in the theaters for Negroes, and in segregating the races in the common schools.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To whites, this was more about protecting their own rights than the rights of Black Chicagoans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"In a state like Illinois, there were people who cared about free Black residents, but there were an awful lot of white people who cared mostly about personal liberty and state and local rights,\" said Pinsker, whose newly published book \"Boss Lincoln\" examines the 16th president's mastery of grassroots politics  \"They didn't want the federal government or Southern slave owners telling them how to run their own lives... you can see a similar emotion rising in a place like Minneapolis, when they feel like masked federal agents [are] roving around the city, picking up people regardless of whether they are criminals or illegal, but just because of the color of their skin.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘A federalism battle’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue has already been settled, legally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's a federalism battle,\" said Pinsker. \"Can states be forced to enforce federal law? That's something the Supreme Court has weighed in on multiple times, and they said no. The sanctuary city advocates are probably going to win in court on the same principles that draw all the way back to Fugitive Slave days.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If history is a guide, ICE loses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Frankly, this is a historical analogy that should concern the Trump administration,\" said Pinsker. \"Despite all the talk of the Fugitive Slave law being draconian, it was an abject failure. The moral revulsion of Northerners against it stopped it from being enforced... the decade from its passage and the Civil War, there were very few and scattered successful episodes. Most Southerners felt it was a complete failure.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History is made by individuals standing up to be counted.

Testimony began with Richard Phillipps, Gray's former owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"That boy belonged to me,\" he testified. \"I bought him and paid for him.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost? One thousand dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hossack was found guilty. He had the right to make a statement before sentencing and didn't let the opportunity go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hossack addresses the court&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It may appear strange to your Honor that I have no sense of guilt,\" he began, explaining he came \"from the tyranny of the Old World\" finding himself \"a stranger in a strange land.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He came over to dig the canal, then went into business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I am one of the men who have made Chicago what it is today, having shipped some of the first grain that was exported from this city.\" Hossack said. \"I am, Sir, one of the pioneers of Illinois, who have gone through the many hardships of the settlement of a new country. I have spent upon it my best days, the strength of my manhood. I have eleven children, who are natives of this my adopted country. No living man, Sir, has greater interest in its welfare; and it is because I am opposed to carrying out wicked and ungodly laws, and love the freedom of my country, that I stand before you today.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like those opposing ICE today, he knew what his freedom was based upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Sir, I place myself upon the Constitution, in the presence of a nation who have the Declaration of Independence read to them every Fourth of July, and profess to believe it. In the presence of civilized man, I hold up the Constitution of my adopted country as clear from the blood of men, and from a tyranny that would make crowned heads blush. The parties who prostitute the Constitution to the support of slavery are traitors — traitors not only to the liberties of millions of enslaved countrymen, but traitors to the Constitution itself which they have sworn to support. A foreigner upon your soil, I go not to the platforms of contending parties to find truth. I go, Sir, to the Constitution of my country: the word slave is not to be found.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He quoted the prosecutor claiming it was ungrateful of Hossack to find protection under American law, yet disobey it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Surely, I have been protected. The fish in the rivers, the quail in the stubble, the deer in the forest, have been protected. Shall I join hands with those who make wicked laws, in crushing out the poor Black man, for whom there is no protection but in the grave, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest?... As a man who had fled from the crushing aristocracy of my native land, how could I support a worse aristocracy in this land?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-540000\" name=\"image-540000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ce40497/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1264x709+0+508/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F98%2F9c%2Fe53dfd604bcea680dd4a6a04a8ae%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-10-at-8-33-35-am.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dcf632c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1264x709+0+508/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F98%2F9c%2Fe53dfd604bcea680dd4a6a04a8ae%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-10-at-8-33-35-am.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0322b31/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1264x709+0+508/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F98%2F9c%2Fe53dfd604bcea680dd4a6a04a8ae%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-10-at-8-33-35-am.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"John Hossack&amp;#x27;s speech.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0322b31/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1264x709+0+508/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F98%2F9c%2Fe53dfd604bcea680dd4a6a04a8ae%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-10-at-8-33-35-am.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7085e19/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1264x709+0+508/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F98%2F9c%2Fe53dfd604bcea680dd4a6a04a8ae%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-10-at-8-33-35-am.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0322b31/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1264x709+0+508/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F98%2F9c%2Fe53dfd604bcea680dd4a6a04a8ae%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-10-at-8-33-35-am.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Hossack’s speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenshot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;He quoted the Fugitive Slave Act, mandating that reaching free soil did not end a person's slavery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"That is the provision that is claimed transforms the government into a monster of iniquity,\" Hossack said. \"How these three or four lines can transform this government, ordained to secure justice, into a mean tool to aid the plunderers of cradles, the destroyers of home, the ravishers of women, and the oppressors of men, to carry on their hellish work — how it can do this thing, I cannot see.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At times, Hossack seemed to speak across the years to our present administration and its masked agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Sir, no law can be enacted so bad but that it will find men deluded or base enough to execute it. The law of Egypt that consigned the new-born babe to the slaughter found tools for its execution. The bloody decree of Herod found men ready to obey the law of the country, though it commanded the slaughter of the innocents of a province, Sir, tell me not of men ready and willing to execute the law! My Redeemer, whose name I am hardly worthy to speak, and yet whose name is all my trust, although he knew no sin, yet he was crucified by law.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This law so plainly tramples upon the divine law, that it cannot be binding upon any human being under any circumstances to obey it. The law that bids me do to other men as I would have other men do to me, is too plain, too simple to be misunderstood.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hossack asks a question that rings today:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"What country is this? Can it be that I live in a land boasting of freedom, of morality, of Christianity? How long, O, how long, shall the people bow down and worship this great image set up in this nation?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he ends by noting, presciently:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"When the history of the great struggle shall be candidly written, the rescuers of Jim Gray will be considered as having done honor to God, to humanity, and to themselves.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hossack faced a $1,000 fine and six months in jail. Judge Drummond gave him 10 days and fined him $100, which citizens of Chicago promptly paid. Chicago feted him as a hero during his captivity — Mayor John Wentworth sprung him, temporarily, to go for a carriage ride and invited him to his home to dinner. Abolitionists turned Hossack's speech into a handbill and distributed it nationwide, and it &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://readingroo.ms/1/3/9/8/13987/13987-h/13987-h.htm\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;lives online today.&lt;/a&gt; Sadly, the speech still makes for relevant reading.&lt;/p&gt;",

What went up mostly didn’t come down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our cart&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;At Chicago’s largest grocery chain Jewel-Osco, 18 items went up in price, 15 stayed the same and two dropped over the past 13 months.&amp;nbsp;At Walmart, many of the 35 items on our list dropped in price more often than they rose, compared to one year ago.&amp;nbsp;The prices of our items at Mariano’s and Target mostly increased or stayed flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key context&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;President Donald Trump famously said during his 2024 campaign he’d get prices down \"starting on Day 1\" of his presidency. And high grocery prices played an outsized role in the presidential election, with many voters reportedly saying they were \"very concerned\" about food costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take our quiz&lt;/b&gt;: See if you can guess the shelf price of items in our cart during a recent trip to Jewel.

her Wicker Park apartment. He was an undergraduate student and she worked in advertising. The two bonded over collecting and digging through estate sales for fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the duo has opened what they say is Chicago’s first vintage photo booth studio, just blocks away from where the couple met 25 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Strip Club Photobooth Studio at 1702 N. Damen Ave. boasts eleven photo booths — six vintage-inspired digital and five vintage analog — in the 2,000-square-foot space, the former home of Bellows Film Lab. People and pets alike are welcome to come and pay $7 for a turn in a booth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, the Vizzaris have been designing and restoring photo booths under their company, A &amp;amp; A Studios, based in Lyons, Illinois. It operates more than 50 booths in businesses in Chicago, at bars and venues such as Replay, Hopsmith Tavern and Schuba’s Tavern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Strip Club, the Vizzaris are aiming for Gen Z audiences. Photo booths there vary in age, with some dating back to the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wykhtlt-l-ir/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;WATCH: INSIDE STRIP CLUB PHOTOBOOTH STUDIO ▶️ &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUbj-y9EqQ-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Pero el gobierno no tiene un interés legítimo en ‘detener a actores privados de hablar como deseen’ para ‘inclinar el debate público en una dirección preferida’”, dice la demanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-8e0000\" name=\"module-8e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosado comenzó el grupo en enero de 2025 para mantener informados a individuos y pequeños negocios sobre dónde estaba operando el Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE) en Chicago, según la demanda. El grupo estaba inicialmente compuesto de compañeros dueños de negocios y amigos y familiares de Rosado. Los miembros del grupo aumentaron en septiembre a medida que la aplicación de la ley de inmigración de ICE aumentaba en la ciudad y sus suburbios circundantes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Para octubre, el grupo contaba con casi 100,000 miembros, con miles de publicaciones y comentarios por día de miembros compartiendo información sobre encuentros violentos y arrestos en toda la ciudad, según la demanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero el 12 de octubre, la activista de derecha y aliada de Trump, Laura Loomer, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1977345952718438707\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;etiquetó a Noem y Bondi en una publicación&lt;/a&gt; afirmando que el grupo de Facebook y otras páginas similares “están poniendo en riesgo la vida de las personas”. Al día siguiente, Loomer &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1977812771799461893?s=20\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;dijo en una publicación&lt;/a&gt; que una fuente del Departamento de Justicia (DOJ) le informó que habían contactado a ejecutivos de Meta, la empresa matriz de Facebook, “para decirles que necesitan remover estas páginas de seguimiento de ICE de la plataforma”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noem y Bondi anunciaron la eliminación del grupo de Facebook en sus cuentas de redes sociales el 14 de octubre. “Los radicales anti-ICE están utilizando aplicaciones de redes sociales para acosar, amenazar y aterrorizar a los valientes hombres y mujeres de ICE y a sus familias”, dijo Noem &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1978182132414448008?s=20\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;en la publicación.&lt;/a&gt; Según la demanda, Facebook notificó a Rosado que el grupo fue deshabilitado porque “violó los Estándares Comunitarios en múltiples ocasiones”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mientras el grupo estaba activo, dice la demanda, los moderadores de Facebook habían eliminado cinco publicaciones en el grupo que no fueron creadas ni aprobadas por Rosado o sus moderadores. Además, la demanda afirma que Facebook le había aconsejado previamente a Rosado que “sólo había identificado este puño de ‘violaciones de participantes’ a sus reglas, las cuales ‘no dañan a su grupo’”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Al censurar nuestro grupo, el gobierno continúa deteriorando nuestra confianza”, dijo Rosado en un &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.thefire.org/news/fire-sues-bondi-noem-censoring-facebook-group-and-app-reporting-ice-activity\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;comunicado&lt;/a&gt;. “No sólo silenciaron mi voz, sino las voces de casi 100,000 otros miembros de la comunidad”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosado presentó la demanda junto con Mark Hodges, residente de Indiana que creó la aplicación Eyes Up, que permitía a los usuarios grabar, almacenar de manera segura y ver videos de agentes de ICE cometiendo posibles violaciones a los derechos civiles. Según la demanda, Apple removió la aplicación de la App Store en octubre, supuestamente después de presiones del gobierno federal, violando el derecho protegido por la Primera Enmienda de Hodges de grabar a las fuerzas del orden en público.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Departamento de Justicia, Apple y Meta no respondieron de inmediato a las solicitudes de comentarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En un comunicado, la Subsecretaria de DHS, Tricia McLaughlin, dijo: “Las aplicaciones de seguimiento de ICE ponen en peligro la vida de los hombres y mujeres de las fuerzas del orden mientras persiguen a terroristas, pandillas violentas y grupos criminales”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pero, por supuesto, FIRE presenta esta decisión correcta de Apple para eliminar estas aplicaciones, como si estuviera capitulando ante la presión, en lugar de ayudar a prevenir un mayor daño a los oficiales federales\", agregó.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La demanda pide a la corte que declare que la coerción ejercida por Bondi y Noem sobre Facebook y Apple suprimió un discurso desfavorable, lo cual viola la Primera Enmienda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Los demandantes presentan este caso para preservar el carácter fundamental de nuestro país como una nación libre, pidiendo a esta corte  que proteja el derecho básico de la Primera Enmienda a compartir información sobre nuestro gobierno y sus actividades”, dice la demanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

But there is still regular-season basketball to be played this weekend, including a couple of big rivalries, a huge conference showdown in the Northern Lake County Conference and the Public League playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a look ahead to a few of the top games with picks and previews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Last week’s record: 4-1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Season record: 28-10&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No. 12 Evanston (23-5) at No. 20 New Trier (21-7), Friday&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evanston has clinched the Central Suburban League South title, so another date with rival New Trier will get the juices flowing again for coach Mike Ellis’ team just prior to state tournament play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Trier, meanwhile, gets another crack at a team that has had its number. The Trevians have yet to beat Evanston in their new gym, which opened in 2023. Since Ellis took over the Evanston program, the Wildkits are 24-10 against their biggest rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these two met last, a 67-59 Evanston win, New Trier was just beginning to learn how to play without point guard and leading scorer Christopher Kirkpatrick. The Trevians have responded of late, winning eight out of their last nine as Kirkpatrick remains saddled with an injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Trier boasts outstanding balance in both their size and scoring. Danny Houlihan, a 6-4 shooter who has signed with High Point, leads New Trier with 16 points a game, but 6-7 freshman Denym Wallace, 6-4 junior Elton Jaegerskog, 6-5 junior Matthew Logue and 6-4 Max Vogel are all capable scorers and offer versatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How balanced is Evanston? The Wildkits are stacked with double-figure scorers who all average between 10-13 points, including Dion Lane, Vito Rocca, Timi Ogunsanya, Ben Ojala and Tate Schroeder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The pick: Evanston 65, New Trier 60&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wauconda (21-7) at Grayslake Central (20-8), Friday&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Northern Lake County Conference comes down to this late-season battle. So let's shine a little light on basketball in this far-reaching area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grayslake Central did stumble earlier this week in an upset loss to Grant. Thus, it’s a must-win situation for the Rams as they now sit one game behind Wauconda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wauconda overcame a 44-36 deficit with just 2:25 to play to win the first matchup back on Jan. 14, a 47-44 come-from-behind thriller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Ortega has emerged as one of the top scoring threats in Lake County. He leads a Wauconda team that can really put points on the board. With Ortega putting up 18.6 points and 3.7 assists a game, the Bulldogs have scored 65 or more points in 17 games this season. Ortega and Leo Brinias (10.2 ppg, 3.7 apg) form a solid scoring and distributing combo in the backcourt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hope is that both 6-6 Austin Carlsen (14.3 ppg, 7.4 rpg), a real underrated player in the Chicago area, and shooting guard Tony Salemi (16.8 ppg) are back and healthy for Friday’s showdown. Carlsen missed Wauconda’s last game while Salemi has missed six games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who haven’t been paying attention, this is the fifth straight 20-plus win season for coach Brian Centella and Grayslake Central. This year’s group is headed by a trio of seniors on the perimeter: 6-3 Cole Halverson 13 ppg, 5 rpg), Alex Granville (13 ppg, 2.5 apg) and point guard Carson Woods (12 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 3 apg).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can Grayslake Central slow down a Wauconda team that would like to play in the 70s? The good news for Wauconda is the score was low last time but still pulled out the win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one will be a fun one that should go down to the wire again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The pick: Grayslake Central 52, Wauconda 50&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No. 13 Fremd (23-2) at Hersey (17-6), Friday&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hersey is out of the MSL West conference race, but it can play the spoiler role in this one while building some momentum for state tournament play. Fremd is all alone atop the league but sits just one game ahead of Palatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fremd won the first matchup 67-63 behind a balanced attack featuring Rafael Pinto (19 pts), Chase Nelson (18 pts), Jordan Williams (16 pts) and Tommy Moffett (15 pts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hersey’s Charlie Pomis has put together a heck of a season. The athletic senior wing is putting up 18 points to go with nearly six rebounds and over three assists a game. He scored 20 in the first meeting, while senior teammate Logan Luxen added 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are two teams that appear to be headed in different directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After starting the season 11-0, Hersey has gone just 5-6 since. The Huskies are at home and could certainly use a pick-me-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Fremd is on an emotional high following an impressive run of frantic finishes in beating quality competition. In the past two weeks the Vikings have knocked off Palatine, Rolling Meadows, New Trier and Niles North in tight ones, including two of those wins coming in overtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The pick: Fremd 62, Hersey 57&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Oswego (20-8) at Oswego East (18-9), Friday&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it the biggest of games in the big picture? No. Neither team is ranked or in conference contention and the seeds have been established. But it’s a rivalry between two teams headed towards 20 wins. Plus, the last one between these two was a dandy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a star attraction in this matchup as well with Oswego East’s Mason Lockett, who is headed to DePaul next year, and Oswego’s Ethan Vahl, one of the top sophomores in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oswego East’s record is a bit deceiving with the schedule it has faced. The Wolves have squared off with six ranked teams, going 2-4 in those games. The tandem of Lockett and junior D'Shaun Bolden regularly combine for 35-plus points a game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the lack of depth can catch up to the Wolves, Oswego has established some depth of its own and balance beyond Vahl’s 21.3 points, 7.1 rebounds and 3.2 assists a game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last time these two met back in December, Oswego’s 59-52 win in overtime was considered an upset. After all, it ended an Oswego East win streak over Oswego at 16 straight. But fast-forward one month later and it’s a flip of the coin. That’s how far Oswego has come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be a surprise if this doesn’t turn into another fantastic finish. But Oswego has been playing the better basketball of late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The pick: Oswego 62, Oswego East 60&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Kenwood (16-7) at No. 18 Young (21-6), Saturday&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the city quarterfinal games this weekend, this figures to be the best — at least on paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenwood edged Morgan Park and Young escaped with an overtime win over Perspectives-Leadership on Thursday to set up the first meeting between these two this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young has two big things going for it: Marquis Clark and the confidence that’s grown from a 11-game winning streak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark is the city’s best player. The high-scoring guard is headed to Tennessee and has takeover ability. The Dolphins haven’t experienced defeat since late December and have lost just two games to in-state teams — Warren and St. Ignatius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a whirlwind of a season for Kenwood with ups and downs. Nonetheless, this is a dangerous team, thanks to the junior tandem of Damari Stephens and Osiris Bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The pick: Young 72, Kenwood 68&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Joliet West (18-8) at No. 7 Homewood-Flossmoor (23-3), Saturday&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, let’s see how much Joliet West has improved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tigers are clearly playing their best basketball of the season. They lost to H-F 58-47 at the Pontiac Holiday Tournament in late December. But they’ve dropped only one game since — to ranked Bolingbrook in overtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will be an ideal measuring stick for Joliet West, which is led by three double-figure scorers: Aamir Shannon (11 ppg, 5 rpg), the much-improved Ryan Lipke (10 ppg, 6 rpg) and Devin Triplett (10 ppg, 5 rpg). Coach Jeremy Kreiger’s team is playing well enough to sneak up on some teams come regional time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H-F has been a model of consistency as the sparkling record shows. That’s possible when you have a point guard like Darrius Hawkins who impacts winning as much as he does. The sophomore sets the tone while averaging 18 points, six assists and 2.5 steals a game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawkins sets the table for lesser-known but ultra-effective Marvin Douglas (12 ppg, 7 rpg), Danny Ruffin (8.7 ppg, 4.1 apg) and Ethan Jackson (8.7 ppg).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The pick: Homewood-Flossmoor 70, Joliet West 64&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-b40000\" name=\"html-embed-module-b40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe title=\"No Shot Clock, Ep. 201: Conference quick takes\" allowtransparency=\"true\" height=\"150\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border: none; min-width: min(100%, 430px);height:150px;\" scrolling=\"no\" data-name=\"pb-iframe-player\" src=\"https://www.podbean.com/player-v2/?i=5patj-1a40c88-pb&amp;from=pb6admin&amp;share=1&amp;download=1&amp;rtl=0&amp;fonts=Arial&amp;skin=1&amp;font-color=auto&amp;logo_link=episode_page&amp;btn-skin=c73a3a\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Then on the next possession, she found senior guard Havana Van Wyk streaking toward the rim. Those two plays show how sklled Bryant is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I think she's the best sophomore that no one talks about,\" coach Brittanny Johnson said. \"I'm hoping that the recognition she's starting to get now will kind of get her a little bit more looks so people start to see that she's a player.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryant's breakout sophomore campaign continued after a stellar 21-point performance against Hinsdale Central. At 6-0, Bryant is a mismatch nightmare for opposing teams. She can see over the top of defenses and deliver accurate, on-time passes to cutting teammates. She's an adept finisher in the paint and sports an impressive shooting stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryant's development is partly why Evanston finished the regular season with a 15-10 record. The Wildkits have close losses to Maine South, Libertyville, Waubonsie Valley and St. Ignatius on their résumé. They also split with a strong Maine South team. That tough schedule will benefit the Wildkits because of their formidable seeding in the IHSA playoffs. They're lumped in with Loyola, Maine South, Glenbrook South and DePaul College Prep as the top seeds above them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Wildkits' season has been much better than last year's 12-20 campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Our goal was really just to be competitive,\" Johnson said. \"We felt like last year we had too many running clock games, so we wanted to come here and end our regular season in a good way.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evanston was dominant defensively on Thursday. They suffocated Hinsdale Central's offense, forcing them into untimely miscues and errant shots. Even when the Red Devils had a sliver of daylight, Evanston's length sped them up. Even with holding a 28-17 halftime lead, Johnson thought the team spent the first half adjusting to the Red Devils' extended zone defense. Once Evanston got used to where the traps were going to come from, the Wildkits were able to move the ball effectively and create easy shots all second half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This was a good game to prepare us for [IHSA] playoffs,\" Bryant said.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior guard Payton King, who made the Central Suburban League All-Conference team, is also an integral piece to the Wildkits' attack. She racked up two steals in the first quarter by correctly reading the defense and pouncing at the right time. She scored eight points on Thursday. She regularly guards the opposing team's best player while playing point guard for Evanston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"[I] definitely put in a lot of work in the offseason, so to be rewarded for that meant a lot,\" King said. \"But that's definitely not going to stop me from continuing to work hard.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;King and Bryant — along with 6-2 forward Simone Hewitt, who is a deterrent in the paint and a reliable finisher— give the Wildkits a fearsome duo heading into the IHSA state playoffs. But Bryant's development raises the ceiling of what Evanston can do this season and next year. There aren't many agile forwards with her combination of scoring, passing and dribbling abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"She's done a way better job in the second half of just utilizing her teammates ... she wants to win so bad,\" Johnson said. \"She can be really dangerous when she shares with all her teammates, because she has great court vision and great IQ. She's just scratching the surface, like it's almost scary how good she could be.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

They grew up in Oak Park looking at the murals and graduated from Oak Park River Forest High School. Hink added their own panel a few years ago. It features an abstract image of a pinkish-purple girl with flowers and creatures coming out of their head. It’s next to the Oak Park Green Line stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All the things inside of you, these creatures or these flowers, everything is unique or beautiful to a person.

Duck through the viaduct and continue west on South Boulevard to North Harlem Avenue near downtown. Turn north toward North Boulevard and follow it east until it ends at North East Avenue. Or bring a bike and ride it, she says.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilson White says the collection contains murals by dozens of artists who come from Oak Park, the greater Chicago area and across the United States. Some local artists have added their artwork multiple times. The artists are paid $1,500 for their work, and must bring their own paint. The village and arts council ensure the mural frame is primed and, when it is finished, the new artwork is covered with an anti-graffiti coating to protect it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selection process is competitive, Wilson White says. She doesn’t keep a list of those who have participated, and each year’s group is chosen anew from the submissions the village receives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-890000\" name=\"image-890000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/421b87f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2Fd9%2F8357c6314622abc6c430b84228e1%2Fmurals-oakpark-260215-35.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4d4bfcc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2Fd9%2F8357c6314622abc6c430b84228e1%2Fmurals-oakpark-260215-35.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/963b50d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2Fd9%2F8357c6314622abc6c430b84228e1%2Fmurals-oakpark-260215-35.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Camille Wilson White is executive director of the Oak Park Area Arts Council, which coordinates the murals with Oak Park village officials.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/963b50d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2Fd9%2F8357c6314622abc6c430b84228e1%2Fmurals-oakpark-260215-35.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/06f8b12/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2Fd9%2F8357c6314622abc6c430b84228e1%2Fmurals-oakpark-260215-35.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/963b50d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa4%2Fd9%2F8357c6314622abc6c430b84228e1%2Fmurals-oakpark-260215-35.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camille Wilson White is executive director of the Oak Park Area Arts Council, which coordinates the murals with Oak Park village officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/murals/2025/09/12/chicago-murals-delisha-mckinney-east-garfield-park\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Artist Delisha McKinney&lt;/a&gt; of East Garfield Park painted a mural along the Green Line last summer, near the intersection of Home Avenue and South Boulevard.

Player standards have risen, and dedicated practice facilities have become a valued resource and a signal of seriousness. They whisper to stars: We’re investing in you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trendsetters on this front were out West. The Aces opened the league’s first dedicated facility in 2023, and the Mercury, Storm, and Valkyries quickly followed. Meanwhile, the Sky were stuck practicing in a suburban recreation center in Deerfield, miles from downtown and miles off the pace of league progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not any longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sky’s new practice facility in Bedford Park will be “operational” this spring, according to CEO Adam Fox and Village of Bedford Park officials. It will be one of only two WNBA practice facilities opening this year. A spokesperson for the Portland Fire told the Sun-Times that their new facility is set to open in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-500000\" name=\"html-embed-module-500000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-table\" data-src=\"visualisation/27609073\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27609073/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"table visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full details on the Sky’s facility haven’t been released, but the basics are clear: modern amenities, a nearly $46 million price tag, and a footprint roughly double the original plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take that, Aces and Storm! Once the talk of the town, the first wave of facilities is old news now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a change, the Sky have a head start, racing past the Dream, Sun, Wings and Toronto Tempo, who still practice in shared spaces. (Though provisions in the next CBA might mandate they hurry up and build something of their own.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sky better enjoy the moment while it lasts. Because the rest of the league is on the move, and they’re not exactly thinking small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fever unveiled plans in January 2025 for a massive 108,000-square-foot complex. Construction is underway, with the Caitlin Clark–Aliyah Boston pick-and-roll expected to move in “ahead of the 2027 season,” according to a team spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Liberty followed in May 2025, announcing an $80 million facility in Brooklyn. It features what they call a “revolutionary locker room concept” — private player suites with full-height wardrobes, sneaker storage, and a seven-foot daybed for recovery. A team spokesperson told the Sun-Times that a 2027 opening is still the expectation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the Los Angeles Sparks jumped into the mix in September 2025, announcing a $150 million investment in El Segundo. The promotional video showed renderings of a “first-of-its-kind player sanctuary” complete with outdoor spa pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-c80000\" name=\"html-embed-module-c80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27609001\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27609001/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hear that, Sky fans? Pools and suites and hundreds of thousands of square feet! In a few short years, the Sky’s once-shiny palace could be known as \"that pool-less building down the road from Magoo’s Bar.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t start crying in your beers yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fans hoping to land a big star — someone to help elevate the team back into playoff contention — there’s still a window of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone expected the 2026 offseason to be historic, since all but two veterans are free agents. Instead, prolonged CBA negotiations mean that offseason business will get rushed. League stars like Breanna Stewart and Kahleah Copper have suggested players may stay put or sign short-term deals rather than make hurried commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means the 2027 free agency period, rather than 2026, could be the year ripe for landing a superstar looking for a long-term home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when the Sky can pounce. While other teams are pointing at renderings or hiding behind construction delays, the Sky can walk free agents through a fully operational, still-new facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-8a0000\" name=\"html-embed-module-8a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27609011\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27609011/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, the Sky might not have spent the same amount as the Sparks, but remember what they teach you in Finance 101: A humble building now is worth much more than a glossy video of a future pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the Sky won’t be able to land a Jackie Young with facilities alone. Stars care about more than just buildings. As head coach Tyler Marsh told the Sun-Times last summer: “It’s how you take care and treat your players once they’re in [the new facility]. You have the building; now what are you doing inside of it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the answer is: learning how to win. In 2026, the Sky need to build a record to match the real estate.&lt;/p&gt;",

Hinton’s young adult novel “The Outsiders” came out in 1967, it revolutionized the genre. Her raw, redemptive story of a fatal class war between Tulsa teens was part “Rebel Without a Cause,” part “Romeo and Juliet” and part “Great Expectations” but wholly its own creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half a century later, “The Outsiders” is a thrilling, can’t-look-away-even-when-you-want-to musical that captures its source material in tone, spirit and story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running through Feb. 22 at the Loop’s Cadillac Palace Theatre, the Tony-winning musical delivers a score (music and lyrics by Justin Levine and Jamestown Revival’s Jonathan Clay and Zach Chance) that veers between hypnotic ballads and stomping bangers. The book (by Adam Rapp and Justin Levine) hurtles the plot forward with the force of the oncoming train that barrels through the second act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RatingCard Enhancement\" data-module data-rating=\"4.0\"  data-align-center&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RatingCard-title\"&gt;\n        ‘The Outsiders’\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    &lt;div class=\"RatingCard-content\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-ce0000\" name=\"module-ce0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;When&lt;/b&gt;: Through Feb. 22&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where&lt;/b&gt;: Cadillac Palace, 151 Randolph St.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tickets&lt;/b&gt;: $49-$165&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Run time&lt;/b&gt;: Two hours, 25minutes, including one intermission&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Info&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"http://broadwayinchicago.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;BroadwayinChicago.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also inspired by Francis Ford Coppola’s 1983 movie adaptation, the 1967-set musical uses sound and visuals to fully immerse the audience in a gritty, merciless world where hope and joy are hard won.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Director Danya Taymor’s richly detailed production lays bare the trauma of surviving police brutality, domestic violence and generational poverty while also celebrating ferocious love and loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Hinton’s book, the musical is centered on Ponyboy Curtis (Nolan White). Ponyboy and little brother Sodapop (Corbin Drew Ross) are orphans cared for by older brother Darrel (Travis Roy Rogers), a once promising football star now working a crap job to keep his brothers fed and housed. The Curtis home is redolent with love, grief, rage and fear. It is also a place where the poems of Robert Frost and Charles Dickens factor: Both “Great Expectations” and “Nothing Gold Can Stay” are threaded through “The Outsiders” in music, lyrics and dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-fd0000\" name=\"image-fd0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1a6a9a2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fca%2Fab%2F8bb2bbee4fd69ea31b7f6d6d6a47%2Foutsiders-tour-photo-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ef98dc6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fca%2Fab%2F8bb2bbee4fd69ea31b7f6d6d6a47%2Foutsiders-tour-photo-10.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6920981/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fca%2Fab%2F8bb2bbee4fd69ea31b7f6d6d6a47%2Foutsiders-tour-photo-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"OUTSIDERS Tour\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6920981/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fca%2Fab%2F8bb2bbee4fd69ea31b7f6d6d6a47%2Foutsiders-tour-photo-10.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/057e026/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fca%2Fab%2F8bb2bbee4fd69ea31b7f6d6d6a47%2Foutsiders-tour-photo-10.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6920981/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fca%2Fab%2F8bb2bbee4fd69ea31b7f6d6d6a47%2Foutsiders-tour-photo-10.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnny Cade, portrayed by Bonale Fambrini (left) looks to Dallas Winston, played by Tyler Jordan Wesley, as a protector and father figure in “The Outsiders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Matthew Murphy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the other greasers, Ponyboy and his best friend Johnny Cade (Bonale Fambrini) look to Dallas Winston (Tyler Jordan Wesley) as a protector and father figure. But Dallas can’t stop the vicious beatings the impoverished greasers take from the city’s rich kids, or “socs” (short for socialites). When Ponyboy and Johnny Cade are befriended by soc queen Cherry Valance (Emma Hearn), the stage is set for a series of devastating circumstances that drive Ponyboy and Johnny into hiding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opening number sets the bar high. Ponyboy begins the exposition-heavy “Tulsa ‘67” as an exquisitely rendered ballad before the music swells in a mighty crescendo as the ensemble joins in and floods the stage with harmonies. When the greasers launch into the defiantly proud “Grease,” the stage pops with the energy and anger of young people pushed to the outermost margins of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taymor’s cast fires on all cylinders. White captures Ponyboy’s vulnerability and intelligence, as well as the swagger of a teenager coming into his own. Fambrini’s Johnny is a soft-spoken dreamer who can recite Robert Frost poetry and wield a blade with equal impact. Hearn’s Cherry is conflicted and entitled, her complex character evolution believable and empathetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas is the stretched-to-its-limit cord holding the greaser community together. He’s slightly older, inarguably charismatic and determined to wrest justice from a world where there is almost none. Wesley’s “Little Brother” is the vocal highlight of the score. Its lyrics are merciless, their anguish overpowering, the melody itself a thing of breathtaking beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas is Black (his race isn’t specified in the book), which deeply intensifies an anxiety-provoking, chilling scene when he’s cornered by a well-armed Tulsa cop (Dante D’Antonio). It’s worth noting the historical context here, specifically the 1921 Tulsa Massacre when an armed white mob murdered hundreds of Black residents. The event is not referenced, but as the scene makes horrifically clear, the mindset that led to it remains alive and well in Tulsa, 1967.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c10000\" name=\"image-c10000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f8a4cc1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5854x3285+0+310/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5a%2F6b%2F79bb361c4996a56d1240865dfb14%2Foutsiders-tour-photo-11.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bf9126c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5854x3285+0+310/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5a%2F6b%2F79bb361c4996a56d1240865dfb14%2Foutsiders-tour-photo-11.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2c1dcb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5854x3285+0+310/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5a%2F6b%2F79bb361c4996a56d1240865dfb14%2Foutsiders-tour-photo-11.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"OUTSIDERS Tour\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2c1dcb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5854x3285+0+310/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5a%2F6b%2F79bb361c4996a56d1240865dfb14%2Foutsiders-tour-photo-11.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/238f77b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5854x3285+0+310/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5a%2F6b%2F79bb361c4996a56d1240865dfb14%2Foutsiders-tour-photo-11.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e2c1dcb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5854x3285+0+310/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5a%2F6b%2F79bb361c4996a56d1240865dfb14%2Foutsiders-tour-photo-11.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff and Rick Kuperman’s choreography is explosive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Matthew Murphy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff and Rick Kuperman’s choreography is explosive. The climactic second-act scorcher “Trouble” is at once beautiful and stomach-churning — an all-ensemble showstopper of music, motion and light. Sound effects specialist Taylor Bense pummels the stage with queasy realism throughout: The awful thunk of Ponyboy’s head, smacked into a carhood; the suffocating whoosh of water when you can’t come up for air; the piercing ring that drowns out all other sound when you’ve been knocked in the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bloody, bone-crunching tumult in the final battle is highly stylized. There are acrobatics, hip-hop, ballet and modern dance styles all detonating like grenades as the brawl continues. You will not be able to look away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lighting (Brian MacDevitt), set (AMP Scenography, featuring Tatiana Kahvegian) and projection (Hana S. Kim) designers create vivid, intricate worlds, Kahvegian’s wood-and-scaffolding set morphing via lights and projection into drive-in movie theater, an abandoned church, a tenement yard and a vast night sky punctuated by shooting stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like everything else in “The Outsiders,” the stage world created is immersive, powerful and unforgettable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Billy Meilicke and Marine Engineer Rich Frizelis — in charge of the tugboat on this morning — the noise is just part of the daily soundtrack that includes the thrum of the 850-horsepower diesel engine and the single blast of the foghorn as we head east on a mission critical to every man, woman and child in Chicago and in many suburbs too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1957, when the Versluis first came into service, its primary job has been to clear the ice from around the city’s water intake “cribs,” each sitting two miles out into Lake Michigan. The massive cribs act like straws, sucking in water that then sloshes through tunnels — hand dug and dynamite blasted — beneath the lake bed to a water purification plant just north of Navy Pier and another at 79th and the lakefront. From there, the water is pumped to homes like yours and mine, about five million in all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a near-constant winter battle to keep the ice from plugging up the crib openings some 20 feet below the surface of the lake. The water that deep doesn’t freeze, but the metal grates can get clogged with ice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-510000\" name=\"image-510000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/80cdc60/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+369/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe3%2Ffc%2F1a4d867046deb259f5679e11f19e%2Ficeboat-260210-27.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bb353bf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+369/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe3%2Ffc%2F1a4d867046deb259f5679e11f19e%2Ficeboat-260210-27.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0d5029c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+369/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe3%2Ffc%2F1a4d867046deb259f5679e11f19e%2Ficeboat-260210-27.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"ICEBOAT_260210_27.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0d5029c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+369/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe3%2Ffc%2F1a4d867046deb259f5679e11f19e%2Ficeboat-260210-27.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac02a97/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+369/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe3%2Ffc%2F1a4d867046deb259f5679e11f19e%2Ficeboat-260210-27.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0d5029c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7008x3933+0+369/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe3%2Ffc%2F1a4d867046deb259f5679e11f19e%2Ficeboat-260210-27.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capt.

In the spring and summer, the tugboat ferries electricians, plumbers and the like out to the cribs for maintenance. You might also find the boat just off the shore, as a visual reference point for pilots during the Chicago Air and Water Show.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;* * *&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Capt. Meilicke in the wheelhouse, the Versluis chugs east past the rust-streaked Chicago Harbor Lighthouse and out into the open lake. With our backs to the city skyline and civilization, we could, for all I can tell, be journeying across the Arctic Ocean. It is slow-going — the tugboat hitting a top speed of about 5 mph, as its half-inch-thick steel bow fractures and crunches ice, leaving seafoam-green water in our wake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the newcomer, there’s a bleak beauty to this crystalline landscape. For Meilicke, the Versluis’ captain since 2018, it’s just frozen water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-660000\" name=\"image-660000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04377a3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6279x3524+0+331/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0d%2Fad%2F3828a86148cc8de049a8be6669a9%2Ficeboat-260210-7.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/949fc05/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6279x3524+0+331/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0d%2Fad%2F3828a86148cc8de049a8be6669a9%2Ficeboat-260210-7.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6c99f5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6279x3524+0+331/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0d%2Fad%2F3828a86148cc8de049a8be6669a9%2Ficeboat-260210-7.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"ICEBOAT_260210_7.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6c99f5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6279x3524+0+331/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0d%2Fad%2F3828a86148cc8de049a8be6669a9%2Ficeboat-260210-7.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d87bb13/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6279x3524+0+331/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0d%2Fad%2F3828a86148cc8de049a8be6669a9%2Ficeboat-260210-7.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6c99f5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6279x3524+0+331/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0d%2Fad%2F3828a86148cc8de049a8be6669a9%2Ficeboat-260210-7.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Versluis is responsible for keeping a navigable channel around Navy Pier and, in warmer months, ferries electricians and plumbers out to the cribs for maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen it so many times, it’s just more ice,” said Meilicke, a barrel-chested father of three who hails from Marquette Park but now lives in a high rise within walking distance of his boat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say all ice is the same. It has been known to mass in boulders as big as bathtubs in the lake surf or slant against the shoreline like books on a shelf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What worries ice breaker captains like Meilicke is the kind that is wind-driven and, if there’s enough of it, can pile up on a boat’s deck and sink it. But more on that later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;* * *&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Versluis, named after the man who served as Chicago’s engineer of water works for 25 years, was built specifically to crush ice. It cost about $325,000, a city official said. A replacement today would run anywhere from $12 to 18 million, Frizelis said. The original engine was replaced 12 years ago, and there are no plans to scrap the Versluis any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Versluis was built to work. It is squat, sits low in the water and has a blunt nose. Extra steel ribs in the front section of the boat stiffen the bow for the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The vessel climbs up on the ice and uses its weight to break it,” Frizelis explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built in Sturgeon Bay, Wisc., it was designed to break through 18 inches of solid ice. During the winter of 2011, famous for its “snowmageddon” blizzard, the ice lake crusted to three feet thick in some places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-860000\" name=\"image-860000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dc6e68e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6233x3498+0+656/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fab%2F45%2F7fc4310c436194fbc81b6d6583f8%2Fphoto-2026-02-07-083331.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/48810af/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6233x3498+0+656/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fab%2F45%2F7fc4310c436194fbc81b6d6583f8%2Fphoto-2026-02-07-083331.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/112b3b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6233x3498+0+656/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fab%2F45%2F7fc4310c436194fbc81b6d6583f8%2Fphoto-2026-02-07-083331.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Photo_2026-02-07_083331.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/112b3b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6233x3498+0+656/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fab%2F45%2F7fc4310c436194fbc81b6d6583f8%2Fphoto-2026-02-07-083331.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18c5bcc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6233x3498+0+656/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fab%2F45%2F7fc4310c436194fbc81b6d6583f8%2Fphoto-2026-02-07-083331.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/112b3b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6233x3498+0+656/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fab%2F45%2F7fc4310c436194fbc81b6d6583f8%2Fphoto-2026-02-07-083331.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The James J.

A trip to the Harrison-Dever crib off Navy Pier typically takes 20-25 minutes in the warmer months. It took six hours during the worst of that winter, Frizelis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the wheelhouse, the boat is an odd blend of mid-20th century and state-of-the-art technology. A 1957 telephone (still working) with a Bakelite receiver hangs a few feet below a touch-screen satellite system. Some of the original brass doorknobs remain, along with a handsome glass-fronted barometer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=\"cms-textAlign-center\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;* * *&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to the men who’ve captained the Versluis (there have been half a dozen of them), and they’ll tell you there’s no better life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been on everything that floats out there,” said Ed Popelas, 76, who captained the boat for about 10 years beginning in June 1992, and whose son Eddie was an engineer on the same vessel. “I wouldn’t trade [the life] for anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-100000\" name=\"image-100000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c52bea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6667x3742+0+352/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F12%2F92%2F64eeeab0475d8122a1146c2449b7%2Ficeboat-260210-41.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1f68b88/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6667x3742+0+352/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F12%2F92%2F64eeeab0475d8122a1146c2449b7%2Ficeboat-260210-41.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a4ee7c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6667x3742+0+352/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F12%2F92%2F64eeeab0475d8122a1146c2449b7%2Ficeboat-260210-41.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"ICEBOAT_260210_41.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a4ee7c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6667x3742+0+352/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F12%2F92%2F64eeeab0475d8122a1146c2449b7%2Ficeboat-260210-41.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f8d48e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6667x3742+0+352/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F12%2F92%2F64eeeab0475d8122a1146c2449b7%2Ficeboat-260210-41.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a4ee7c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6667x3742+0+352/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F12%2F92%2F64eeeab0475d8122a1146c2449b7%2Ficeboat-260210-41.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A photo of James J.

You have to fend for yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this day, a gentle, 15-mph wind ruffles the water where it is visible between the ice, now more of a slush after the Versluis has ploughed through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meilicke passes the unmanned candy-striped Harrison-Dever crib, plastered with “Danger, Keep Away” signs. He makes a wide turn toward the shore, where the city’s jagged skyline pierces a light fog — a sight both reassuring and thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sight that, for these sailors, never gets old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t tell you how many pictures I took of sunsets,” said Eddie Popelas. “To see the sun set behind Chicago is gorgeous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His father agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Coming back to the city, it pulled at my heartstrings. I love the city that much,” Ed Popelas said. “It’s always beautiful and something that needs to be appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Venegas also takes advantage of Curie’s offerings and enjoys sewing and exercise classes for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the future of those services is in limbo after the Trump administration’s decision to discontinue the Full Service Community Schools grant, which provides schools across Illinois, including Curie, with funding for extra support like food pantries and after-school programs. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2025/12/29/two-lawsuits-challenge-trump-administrations-termination-of-community-schools-grants-in-illinois\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Two lawsuits challenging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the decision are making their way through the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venegas said the loss of the programs at Curie would be devastating for the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It will affect us as parents and our children,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACT Now Illinois, the group responsible for distributing an $18.5 million annual grant, filed a lawsuit in federal court in December challenging the abrupt discontinuation. One of the nonprofit’s grantees, Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, and the American Federation of Teachers filed a second lawsuit together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Stanton, executive director of ACT Now Illinois, said that while the nonprofit is doing what it can to keep programs running, hundreds of jobs and 150 after-school programs across the state have already been lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/12/29/two-lawsuits-challenge-trump-administrations-termination-of-community-schools-grants-in-illinois\"   &gt;Lawsuits challenge Trump administration’s termination of grants for Illinois schools&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/12/18/act-now-illinois-community-schools-grant-trump\"   &gt;Trump administration to end grants for support services at many Illinois schools&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Brighton Park Neighborhood Council runs the Community Schools program for 500 students at Curie. The grant provided funds for programming ranging from ACT prep, mentoring, tutoring and classes for parents, to popular student clubs such as gardening and the Black Student Union.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPNC lost its funding when the grant was discontinued at the end of December but has shifted its resources to keep providing some services and staff, according to a spokesperson. The group says it won’t be able to do that indefinitely and hopes the lawsuit can lead to a long-term resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That also leaves the fates of three full-time and 11 part-time staff members up in the air because their positions are funded by the grant at Curie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Brighton Park Neighborhood Council and Curie hosted a town hall meeting at the high school where parents, teachers and students spoke about the importance of keeping the programming in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander Espino, a sophomore, takes part in several after-school programs, including mariachi and National Honors Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After-school programs are important for me because school is like my second home,” Alexander said. “For many of us after school activities keep us engaged and motivated and off the streets in these difficult times.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanton, the ACT Now Illinois leader, said the group has received short-term funding extensions — sometimes one week at a time — as its lawsuit plays out in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though we’re getting these per day allotments, it’s impossible to run quality programming and to give students what they need in that type of funding scheme,” because it's difficult to plan for things like field trips or long-term projects, Stanton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Families can’t plan child care, transportation, after-school support or even their work schedules when services can completely disappear without warning,” Stanton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hearing on the lawsuit is set for Tuesday, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ACT Now grant funds programs at 32 schools, including Curie and Clinton Elementary School in Chicago, as well as several downstate and in the suburbs. The grant was supposed to continue for three more years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration told ACT Now it was pulling the grant because it concluded the programs no longer served the “best interest of the Federal Government.” According to one of the lawsuits, the U.S. Department of Education blames grant applications that mention a focus on equity, racial justice and serving historically marginalized populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Herrin, a city of just over 12,000 people located near the southern tip of the state, about &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/herrincityillinois/RHI525224\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;14.5% of the population lives in poverty.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Andrew Anderson, vice principal at Herrin High School, said the grant money has allowed the school to hire a community outreach worker to help students struggling academically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worker meets with students and parents to figure out if there’s an issue at home or an unmet need, such as tutoring or transportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s another person able to make connections between the family and between the school,” Anderson said. Without the grant money that position may be eliminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Wednesday’s town hall at Curie, State Reps. Aaron Ortiz and Theresa Mah urged community members to contact legislators about including money for after-school programs in the upcoming state budget. Ortiz and Mah are sponsoring a bill that would create a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.ilga.gov/Legislation/BillStatus/FullText?GAID=18&amp;amp;DocNum=3082&amp;amp;DocTypeID=HB&amp;amp;LegId=161432&amp;amp;SessionID=114\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;$50 million community schools grant program&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; within the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After-school programs are not just activities, they are investments in students, safety and leadership and our future,” Alexander said.&lt;/p&gt;",

La declaración también menciona el tiroteo que hirió a Marimar Martínez, quien sobrevivió después de que el año pasado un agente federal le disparó varias veces. Se pide a la fiscal del estado que investigue los “cargos disponibles” y el “uso excesivo de fuerza” en los tiroteos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;También señalan el uso desproporcionado de fuerza por parte de la policía contra residentes negros, y afirmaron que la justicia debe aplicarse de manera equitativa porque “ningún oficial y ninguna agencia está por encima de la ley”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-4f0000\" name=\"module-4f0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“La agenda de aplicación de la ley de inmigración de la administración de Trump ha producido un patrón claro y alarmante de violencia”, dice la declaración. “Apoyamos las investigaciones exhaustivas de la aplicación de la ley dondequiera que los agentes federales hayan violado la ley. Instamos a la fiscal del estado del Condado de Cook a actuar de manera rápida, proactiva y transparente para garantizar la rendición de cuentas y brindar justicia a las familias y comunidades que han sido perjudicadas”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esto ocurre poco más de una semana después de que los demócratas de la Cámara de Representantes de Illinois &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ilhousedems.com/2026/02/03/elected-officials-call-on-cook-county-states-attorney-eileen-oneil-burke-to-investigate-the-fatal-shooting-of-silverio-villegas-gonzalez-and-the-near-fatal-shooting-of-marimar-martin/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;publicaran un llamado a la acción similar&lt;/a&gt; dirigido a la oficina de la fiscal del estado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La oficina de la fiscal del estado del Condado de Cook dijo que, aunque Burke está “profundamente preocupada” por el “comportamiento aberrante” de los agentes de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas a nivel nacional, su oficina “no realiza investigaciones independientes sobre conductas criminales y carece de jurisdicción sobre las agencias federales, excepto en circunstancias extremadamente limitadas”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke destacó  que su equipo ha redactado un protocolo sobre cómo los sistemas legales locales pueden responder a los agentes federales de manera “clara y basada en la ley”, el cual ha sido compartido con las fuerzas del orden locales y estatales, así como con otros fiscales para recibir retroalimentación.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estamos comprometidos a hacer todo lo posible, dentro de la ley, para apoyar y revisar las investigaciones sobre la aplicación de la ley en relación con esa conducta y enjuiciar cuando sea apropiado”, dijo la oficina de Burke en un comunicado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke está entre los líderes locales que buscan maneras de responsabilizar a los agentes federales por herir y matar a residentes, las leyes federales que a menudo bloquean esas acciones, y la administración del presidente Donald Trump que ha impedido las investigaciones sobre el uso de la fuerza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La semana pasada, Burke dijo a su personal que la reciente orden ejecutiva del alcalde Brandon Johnson —que ordena al Departamento de Policía de Chicago (CPD) documentar posibles delitos cometidos por agentes federales— es inapropiada y podría poner en peligro los enjuiciamientos penales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2026/02/11/alcalde-johnson-dice-que-no-intenta-controlar-que-casos-de-abuso-de-ice-se-mandan-a-la-fiscal-del-estado\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;defendió la medida&lt;/a&gt; y dijo que intentaba ayudar a Burke al proporcionar evidencia para los enjuiciamientos de agentes federales, lo cual afirmó que ella había mencionado públicamente.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Es uno de los muchos esfuerzos que funcionarios estatales, del condado y locales han llevado a cabo en un intento de frenar a los agentes federales en el área de Chicago, aunque muchos han enfrentado incertidumbre legal, y expertos han puesto en duda una orden ejecutiva que Johnson firmó en agosto que &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2025/09/02/el-alcalde-johnson-firma-orden-ejecutiva-para-proteger-a-chicago-de-agentes-y-tropas-federales\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;amenazaba con demandas contra agentes federales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En noviembre, el ahora exjuez presidente del Circuito del Condado de Cook, Timothy Evans, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/14/top-cook-county-judge-bars-civil-arrests-at-courthouses-citing-chilling-effect\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;firmó una orden&lt;/a&gt; que prohíbe los arrestos civiles, o aquellos sin una orden firmada por un juez, en las cortes del condado, aunque los funcionarios federales se comprometieron a violarla de todos modos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Tournament director Steve John said when Kelce was announced as playing in the pro-am, more than $60,000 in tickets were sold over the next 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swift is rumored to be in town. But she was not at Spyglass Hill on Thursday, where Kelce was playing with pro partner Keith Mitchell along with Mackenzie Hughes and retired NFL quarterback Alex Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter. Pebble Beach is the main attraction, and John said some $21,000 tickets for the second round were sold between 6:30 p.m. Thursday and 6:30 a.m. Friday, two hours before Kelce played.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 spectators lined the left side of the first fairway at Pebble Beach, but all they saw was Kelce hitting his tee shot to the right, into and out of the trees, and along the cart path (he made a par).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, there was plenty of Chiefs gear in the crowd, one young girl wearing a Kansas City sweatshirt. The tournament has a long history of athletes over the years, including Ken Griffey Jr. playing in a group with Tiger Woods some 20 years ago. Roger Clemens once made a hole-in-one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, however, was clearly a Swift moment. Except that it wasn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John and his tournament staff left nothing to chance. When he wasn't busy responding to text messages — will she be there or not? — he had plans in place for security, for transportation across the course, even a secure suite overlooking the 18th green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big crowd — not the largest, but more than usual — followed along the Kelce group down the first few holes. They still had four hours left. They had hope.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

When checks were finally in the mail, the Johnson administration “realized that they screwed up and didn’t take out pension deductions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of these people had 20 or 30 grand deposited into deferred [compensation] to get the tax savings and then they had it removed because the city screwed up the pension deductions. The city took that money back,” Cleary told the Chicago Sun-Times. “Other people had checks mailed to homes that they no longer live in. And the city is saying, `We’re not gonna cut another check until we get that first check back.’ Well, our members don’t live there. How can you get that check back? We don’t know where it is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A letter attached to the firefighters contract  states that retroactive paychecks delivered after the Dec. 30 deadline must include interest at an annual rate of 4.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re saying they don’t owe us that interest. They’re not acknowledging a letter in our contract that states if you don’t pay us within 75 days, you owe us 4.5%-per-annum. They’re saying they don’t owe us that,” Cleary said. “You do. It’s in the contract. We filed a grievance, and we’re gonna take them to arbitration. We’re gonna win that. It’s a no-brainer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;City Comptroller Michael Belsky said in a statement that he is \"aware of the issue\" involving retro pay and has been \"working with the union to resolve it.\" He refused to elaborate, citing the union grievance and potential litigation that could come from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleary said there is no excuse for forcing firefighters and paramedics who waited four years for a new contract and the pay raises that were supposed to come with it to wait even longer for the lump-sum payments they are owed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It just shows the incompetence of the city. How do you forget to take out pension deductions? How is that possible? We went without a contract for four years,” he said. “This should have been ready to go right when we ratified the contract. All they should have done was press the button and say, 'Let’s go.'\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ald. Matt O’Shea (19th), whose far Southwest Side ward is home to scores of firefighters and paramedics, called the payroll snafu “yet another example of the calamity that is this administration. They knew they had an agreement … months ago. They dragged this out. They didn’t communicate. When they finally cut the checks, how many mistakes were made, whether it’s an incorrect address or not taking proper dollars out.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ald. Nick Sposato (38th), a former Chicago firefighter, called the payroll snafu “disappointing” and “kind of sad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Johnson administration was already under fire for borrowing $186 million to cover the retroactive paychecks after the City Council was told repeatedly that the money to resolve the firefighters contract was set aside in every one of Mayor Brandon Johnson’s three budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s why it’s very disappointing. Because you knew this was coming. You weren’t ambushed or anything. So you had to be prepared,” Sposato said. “Even if one person really needed the money — or they were putting it all in deferred [compensation], and now they can’t because it came in a different year — there’s a whole boatload of problems that could result from this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cleary has characterized the six-year contract as a “status quo” agreement because it includes none of the union concessions that Johnson and his two predecessors talked about, but never pursued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contract includes pay raises of up to 20%, depending on the rate of inflation, and a $2,500 cash bonus to match the increases awarded to rank-and-file police officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day the City Council unanimously approved the agreement, Cleary argued that the three-year loan  made it clear that Johnson slow-walked negotiations on a new firefighters contract to avoid paying the $186 million in back pay and to “spend that money elsewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;",

He said last summer that he has hated missing events with his children over the last few years, and now he can devote himself much more to his family and other interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It's time for me to show up for others and in other ways,\" Paul wrote on a social media post, announcing the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He strongly hinted earlier this season that this year was going to be his last. Paul was a four-time All-NBA first team selection, and he ranks second in NBA history with 12,552 assists and 2,728 steals. He was the first player to score at least 20,000 points while recording at least 10,000 assists; LeBron James and Russell Westbrook have both since done that as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul became arguably the most accomplished player in Clippers franchise history while leading the team to six winning seasons from 2011-17, including the Clippers' first two Pacific Division titles and three playoff series victories. Paul returned to Los Angeles as a free agent last July, rejoining a franchise where he is loved by fans — but it went bad quickly, and Paul's last game with the Clippers was Dec. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turned out to be his last NBA game, period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"While this chapter of being an 'NBA player' is done, the game of basketball will forever be engrained in the DNA of my life, spanning three decades,\" Paul wrote. \"It's crazy even saying that!! Playing basketball for a living has been an unbelievable blessing that also came with lost of responsibility. I embraced it all.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul is one of seven players to have an NBA career span at least 21 seasons. And he's already in the Hall of Fame: the 2008 Olympic \"Redeem Team\" was enshrined as part of the 2025 class. It won't be long before he goes in on his own as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Fox, 71, worked with new Bills quarterbacks coach Bo Hardegree and special teams coordinator Jeff Rodgers during his three-year stint with the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/12/bears-nfl-mock-draft-pick-25-overall-fernando-mendoza-tj-parker-indiana-clemson-april\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Bears&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Bears hired Fox, he was one of just six men to lead two different teams — the Panthers and Broncos — to the Super Bowl. The Bears fired Fox at the end of the 2017 season after he posted a 14-34 record as head coach. Fox didn’t coach again until 2022, when he was named a senior defensive assistant for the Colts. He held the same job with the Lions the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady has no previous experience with Fox. The 36-year-old Brady was hired to replace Sean McDermott, who was fired after a playoff loss to the Broncos in January and despite the fact he posted a 12-5 record in 2024. In nine years with the Bills, McDermott went 98-50 in the regular season and 8-8 in the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module

He’s from London, and a clinical psychology doctoral student at Roosevelt University. He got into running as a way to recover after a mountain hiking accident and took on this feat in August 2024. But he doesn’t consider himself a fan of running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think running is miserable,” he said. “Training for marathons, running the same route every day. I think that's so boring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What he does enjoy about running are the different places it takes him to. He documents everything on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.instagram.com/heyjoabe/?hl=en\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Instagram&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@heyjoabe?_r=1&amp;amp;_t=ZT-93rjn7kX5oc\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Tik Tok&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the neighborhoods he’s in and the people he meets, to how safe it is to run in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some people have told me, Don't go to certain places in Chicago, and I've gone, and I've felt safe,” Barbosa said. “Everything's been amazing for me, a lot of community, a lot of great people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s amassed a large following on social media, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRrBrtlDSC6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;with his most viral video garnering 1.7 million views.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; He said nowadays he gets stopped by residents on his runs more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chicago flag he wears as a cape helps him stand-out. During one of Barbosa’s runs, he decided to purchase it from a souvenir shop as a memento for himself. His hands were full, so he tied the flag around his neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Someone just told me ‘Oh, you're the Chicago superhero.’ And I was like, Oh, that's cool. That could be my brand,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked what keeps him going, Barbosa said he considers himself a “completionist.” He also happens to hold the Guinness World Record for the fastest known time to visit every CTA station, an endeavor he took on with his friend and brother. They completed it in just under 9 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"  data-align-portrait-left&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f00000\" name=\"image-f00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium-3x4\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n                &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"375\"\n     height=\"500\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4de512e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2268x3024+0+504/resize/375x500!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2F9e%2Ff3c87b8944f085ccb357b5bbfda7%2Fimg-7813.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1MDBweCIgd2lkdGg9IjM3NXB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n            \n        \n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"375\"\n     height=\"500\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b160098/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2268x3024+0+504/resize/375x500!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2F9e%2Ff3c87b8944f085ccb357b5bbfda7%2Fimg-7813.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1MDBweCIgd2lkdGg9IjM3NXB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"CHICAGORUNNER.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b160098/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2268x3024+0+504/resize/375x500!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fee%2F9e%2Ff3c87b8944f085ccb357b5bbfda7%2Fimg-7813.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1MDBweCIgd2lkdGg9IjM3NXB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joabe Bayer Barbosa, with his brother James Barbosa (left) and Matthew Plese (right), during their attempt to complete the record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joabe Bayer Barbosa&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbosa has a meticulous system of running to get every inch of a street, which includes some dead ends. He will go over some blocks twice to ensure he’s covered it completely. Because of that extra milage, he said, it will take about 6,000 miles of running to complete the map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He runs 5 to 6 times a week, 10 to 12 miles a day with more than 370 cumulative days of running so far. He kept going even in the recent sub-zero temperatures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbosa feels the end coming, and he said it’s bittersweet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm going to feel empty. I’m already starting to feel empty. Because it's more about the journey than the actual end goal,” he said. “It's going to be a celebration but after, I need to do something else. Something better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s next? Barbosa isn’t sure. But, showcasing Chicago neighborhoods will definitely be at its center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Potentially running every park in Chicago, or doing a run in every neighborhood in Chicago, because there's some neighborhoods I haven't documented,” Barbosa said.&lt;/p&gt;",

You probably don’t have what it takes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not because you’re inherently unqualified — hell, if Donald Trump can get elected, it sure feels like anyone can, and I have no doubt you’d probably do a better job. But a good presidential candidate must have a few important things going for him or her that would make running for president nearly impossible for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have to have money, for one, or access to people with lots of it. Some relevant experience helps, usually in politics, law or the military. Trump is, in fact, the only U.S. president to have never held public office or a military position when he was elected in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good personality isn’t a must — see Richard Nixon. But there is one intangible that is a must, and it’s nearly impossible to buy it or create it overnight: Name ID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-d40000\" name=\"module-d40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, for all his moral, ethical and intellectual failings, was able to trade mostly on his name and brand to get elected the first time, convincing a not small number of voters that, despite his lack of political experience — or interest in policy — he was the right man for the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new crop of Democrats is eyeing the 2028 election, each hoping they have the right combination of things to get across the finish line. But one just got a huge boost in name ID — and from Trump himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, is thinking of running for president — and there are plenty of indications he is, including &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5700211-senator-kelly-trump-threats/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;his own words&lt;/a&gt; — he couldn’t buy the exposure he got this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a one-two punch to the administration, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s attempts at punishing Kelly for a video in which he and five other Dem lawmakers urged military service members to not follow illegal orders, were swatted down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video was released by Kelly, Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., Reps. Chris Deluzio, D-Pa., Maggie Goodlander, D-N.H., Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., and Jason Crow, D-Colo. — all veterans of the military or intelligence community — as Trump was authorizing constitutionally-questionable strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and deploying troops to American cities to combat crime and illegal immigration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they said in the video was a simple and irrefutable fact: “You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Seditious behavior? No way&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump, deep in his authoritarian era and having no use for subtlety, clapped back and called the video “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever the loyal foot soldier, Hegseth followed by announcing he’d look to strip Kelly of his Navy rank and reduce his military pension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on Thursday, Judge Richard Leon, a George W. Bush appointee, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/bush-appointed-judge-temporarily-blocks-hegseth-from-punishing-mark-kelly-over-resist-unlawful-orders-video/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that was a violation of Kelly’s First Amendment rights. In the words of James Madison, “Duh.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the week, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/just-in-trump-doj-fails-to-indict-mark-kelly-and-5-other-democrats-who-posted-video-urging-troops-to-refuse-illegal-orders/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;another blow&lt;/a&gt; — former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, now the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, failed to get an indictment against Kelly and the other lawmakers because they couldn’t get a grand jury to support it. So much for the ham sandwich theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Trump went 0-2 at rebuking Kelly, but for Kelly, it couldn’t have gone any better. Trump made him a Democratic hero, a free speech warrior and most importantly, he gave him weeks of free media, his face and name splashed across the cable news shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, Trump’s authoritarian impulses, his Justice Department’s incompetence, and his defense secretary’s thin skin helped set Kelly up for a real shot at a presidential nomination, elevating him in stature and boosting his name ID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other Dems eyeing 2028 wish they were so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;S.E.

Friday's rally is part of the group's \"Spring surge to melt ICE,\" Valice said. From February until April the group intends to continue mobilizing community members to continue building a movement to stop deportations, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is the start,\" Valice said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c90000\" name=\"image-c90000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abb66d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F16%2Fb5%2Ffead950a43c2bd7be93c611a50d6%2Fstudentprotests-260214-003.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3a66541/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F16%2Fb5%2Ffead950a43c2bd7be93c611a50d6%2Fstudentprotests-260214-003.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1238dc1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F16%2Fb5%2Ffead950a43c2bd7be93c611a50d6%2Fstudentprotests-260214-003.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Hundreds of students from area high schools rally in Federal Plaza, in The Loop, joining students around the country in a national high school walkout day to protest Immigration Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security, Friday, Feb. 13, 2026.

Rivas, Jr. and Angel Gutierrez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group called the decision to part ways with the search firm hired to help find a new CEO “a sad development.” They accused Mayor Brandon Johnson “and his allies” of interfering in the search process and creating dysfunction that made it “impossible” for the firm to finish the job. They likened the situation to “sabotage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the mayor’s office said that claim was “baseless and inaccurate” and that, so far, they have not been presented with any candidates. Board president Sean Harden, who was appointed by Johnson, called the statement divisive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are supposed to be showing up and supporting students as trustees,” Harden said in an interview “They should ask themselves if [their] actions really are in the best interest of the district.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the latest complication in a search process that began last spring shortly after the school board fired former CPS CEO Pedro Martinez without cause. The board initially set out to find a new leader by the end of December, and appeared to be on track when it narrowed its search down to a few finalists in November. But there was little movement after the names of the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/11/05/cps-ceo-search-macquline-king\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;candidates were leaked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/11/07/school-leaders-from-new-york-city-and-denver-finalists-cps-top-job-ceo-superintendent\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;one of them withdrew his name&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board now says it will “bring in the next leader for a full orientation and transition planning with CPS leadership” before the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cpsboe.org/supt-ceo-search\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;start of the next school year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding another layer of complication: All of this is happening as the school board governance is about to change. Currently, the board is a mix of 10 elected members and 11 appointed by Johnson, but it will move to a fully elected body after voters head to the polls later this year. The board is heading the hiring process for the district’s next leader after years of mayoral control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The six board members who signed the statement called on the district to retain interim CEO Macquline King “through the 2027 school year so a fully-elected board can have a say in a permanent leader for the District.” King applied to the permanent position, but did not make the first cut of finalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harden said the termination of the search firm’s contract is another step in the process and the board is on track to identify the next leader by next school year. He thanked the firm, Alma Advisory Group, for its efforts, which he said went beyond what they were initially asked to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They offered extensive support, conducted intake screening of over 100 candidates, provided interview training to each board member based on best practices and participated in countless meetings,” Harden wrote in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harden said the board stopped accepting applications for the superintendent role on Feb. 6 and will work closely with Alma over the next 30 days “to ensure a seamless transition into final interviews.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t immediately clear how many candidates are left or whether the district would release their names to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve provided critical insights and support throughout this process, and we wish them well as they move forward into the next phase of their search,” a spokesperson for the firm wrote in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;",

Instead, the two-time reigning world champion was trying to hold back the tears after one of the worst nights of his career, one that left a star-packed crowd inside Milano Ice Arena sitting in stunned silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Honestly, yeah, I was not expecting that,\" Malinin said. \"I felt going into this competition I was so ready. I just felt ready going on that ice. I think maybe that might have been the reason, is I was too confident it was going to go well.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaidorov finished with a career-best 291.58 points to give his nation its first gold medal of the Winter Games, while Yuma Kagiyama earned his second consecutive Olympic silver medal and Japanese teammate Shun Sato took bronze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there was Malinin, who dropped all the way to eighth place. He finished with 264.49 points, his worst total score in nearly four years, and one that ended a two-plus year unbeaten streak that covered 14 full competitions around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The nerves just went so overwhelming,\" Malinin said, \"and especially going into that starting pose, I just felt like all the ... traumatic moments of my life really just started flooding my head, and there's just like, so many negative thoughts that just flooded into there and I just did not handle it.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Malinin's journey in the Milan Cortina Games had felt a little bit off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was beaten by Kagiyama in the short program of the team event, later acknowledging for the first time that the pressure of winning at the Olympics had started to get to him. And he still wasn't quite his dominant self despite a head-to-head win over Sato in the team free skate, which clinched the second consecutive gold medal for the Americans in the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by the time of his individual short program Tuesday night, Malinin's fearless swagger and unrivaled spunk seemed to be back. He took a five-point lead over Kagiyama and Adam Siao Him Fa of France that seemed insurmountable going into Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malinin had decided to practice early in the day at U.S. Figure Skating's alternate training base in Bergamo, just outside of Milan, allowing him to escape the Olympic bubble and avoid sitting in the arena all night. And he was the essence of calm throughout his warmup, never once falling in all of his practice jumps while wearing his familiar glittering black and gold ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then came a performance that might well haunt Malinin for the rest of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the atmospheric music with his own voice-over began to play, he opened with a quad flip, one of a record-tying seven quads in his planned program, then appeared to be going after the quad axel only he has ever landed in competition and had to bail out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malinin recovered to land his quad lutz before his problems really began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He only doubled a planned quad loop, throwing his timing off. He fell on a quad lutz, preventing him from doing the second half of the quad lutz-triple toe loop combination that would have earned him big points. And in his final jumping pass, which was supposed to be a high-scoring quad salchow-triple axel, Malinin only could muster a double salchow — and he fell on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time the music stopped, Malinin was left trying to mask his sorrow for a crowd that included Nathan Chen, the 2022 Olympic champion, along with seven-time Olympic gold medal gymnast Simone Biles, actor Jeff Goldblum and his wife, Emilie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I've been through a lot,\" Malinin said. \"Being the Olympic gold hopeful is really just a lot to deal with, especially for my age.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaidorov was just as shocked as everyone as the realization hit that he had won the gold medal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was only in sixth after the short program and an afterthought as the night began. But the 21-year-old known for high-flying jumps but maddening inconsistency delivered the performance of his life, landing five quads in a technically flawless program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seemed altogether fitting that Coldplay's song \"Viva La Vida\" played after the medal ceremony, as Shaidorov and his fellow medalists from Japan took a victory lap. \"I used to rule the world,\" the lyrics begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I went up to him and I congratulated him,\" Malinin said of the new Olympic champion, \"because watching him skate — I watched him the locker room — I'm just so proud of him. I heard that he had not a great season.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

Opposing hitters touched up Sox relievers for 79 home runs and a .245 batting average — all figures in the bottom third of the league.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We lost so many one-run games over the last two years, and it’s been a point of frustration,” assistant general manager Josh Barfield said. “There’s a number of different things you can attribute that to. One way we thought we could really help address that, and hopefully flip that, is having a stronger bullpen, adding guys with more power. We’ve got four guys at the back of our bullpen who can all touch 100 on a given day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the top of the list is free-agent addition Seranthony Domínguez, a World Series contender with Toronto last year who’s poised to serve as the Sox’ first bona fide closer since Liam Hendriks. The Sox notched an MLB-low 25 saves last year, not that there were many opportunities (49, also a league-worst).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just focus a little bit more and get people out, and don't think about,” Domínguez said of his late-inning mentality, while getting acquainted with his new teammates at Camelback Ranch. “Just don't think a lot and do your thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General manager Chris Getz was thinking a lot about the velocity that powered Domínguez to 79 strikeouts and a 3.16 ERA over 67 appearances last year, which saw the right-hander traded from Baltimore to the Blue Jays. Batters hit .132 against Domínguez in 12 postseason appearances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He's our closer,\" Venable said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-db0000\" name=\"image-db0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/34c07ad/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5436x3051+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4d%2Ffd%2F61f82e79460ca8464ab9ca093402%2Fap25222288989446.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/00d63b9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5436x3051+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4d%2Ffd%2F61f82e79460ca8464ab9ca093402%2Fap25222288989446.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b920049/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5436x3051+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4d%2Ffd%2F61f82e79460ca8464ab9ca093402%2Fap25222288989446.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Seranthony Domínguez \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b920049/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5436x3051+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4d%2Ffd%2F61f82e79460ca8464ab9ca093402%2Fap25222288989446.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/32e809f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5436x3051+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4d%2Ffd%2F61f82e79460ca8464ab9ca093402%2Fap25222288989446.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b920049/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5436x3051+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4d%2Ffd%2F61f82e79460ca8464ab9ca093402%2Fap25222288989446.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seranthony Domínguez &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessie Alcheh/AP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getz picked him up on a two-year, $20 million deal with money saved from shedding Luis Robert Jr.’s salary in a trade with the Mets, which also opened up space &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2026/02/01/white-sox-to-acquire-jordan-hicks-pitching-prospect-david-sandlin\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;to take on Jordan Hicks’ contract&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in a trade with Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal wasn’t a complete salary dump for the Red Sox. Along with pitching prospect David Sandlin, Hicks’ arrival to the Sox’ bullpen brings a four-seamer that topped 104 mph when he burst onto the scene in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 29-year-old right-hander is looking to bounce back from a rocky ‘25 that saw his ERA balloon to 6.95 after struggles as a starter in San Francisco followed him to Boston’s pen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getz &amp;amp; Co. will also look for second-year flame-thrower Grant Taylor to take the next step in his development after a tantalizing debut season. He struck out 54 hitters in 36⅔ innings last year after getting called up from Double-A Birmingham in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor, a college teammate and friend of Pirates’ ace Paul Skenes, had pushed for a shot at starting this year, but the front office values the shut-down potential late in games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was just sharpening what makes me successful at the big-league level: heaters, and getting the slider back in,” the 23-year-old said of his offseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the Sox’ high-powered, high-leverage options is Jordan Leasure, the third-year right-hander who struck out 81 batters in 68 appearances last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venable said “it’s nice to have some fuel in the bullpen there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As you are trying to find paths to win those close games, it certainly helps to have a bullpen where you have different options and can go to different places on different days,” he said. “We’ll see how it all shakes out. It’s nice to have some guys that can throw hard, for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListL\" data-module  data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-4a0005\" name=\"list-4a0005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, pageCount=2423, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, pullQuoteIcon=[{image=null, narrowImage=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=null}], tableFont=font-1, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, carouselSpeed=null, buttonHoverBgColor=#a91d23, rteHeadingFont=font-1, secondaryColor=#656565, hideCategories=true, _template=/page/list/includes/PageList-header.hbs, font3=Arial, font4=Source-serif-4, ctaUrl=null, pagination=[{body=[Next Page], href=?p=2, _template=/link/Link.hbs, contentId=null, pianoSectionSlug=null, target=null}], hideImage=false, footerLinkHoverColor=#d3242c, hideAudioPlayback=false, description=[], showSecondItemMedia=false, listColumns234=null, footerTextColor=#ffffff, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox, headerSecondaryBgColor=#000000, primaryTextColorInverse=#ffffff, titleColor=null, ampLink=null, listHeaderPosition=null, hideDescriptions=false, showActionBar=true, linkHoverColor=#d3242c, buttonBgColor=#d3242c, items=[{type=Image, description=[{items=[It’s the middle of February, and already the Sox are making little missteps that make one wonder what’s going on here.]}], wordCount=870, anchorId=promo-b90000, _styledTemplate=null, media=[{alt=White Sox Spring Basesball, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/22/93/5ff19b6d4684934f00bc24b3545c/white-sox-spring-basesball.jpg, width=5100, height=3400}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/22/93/5ff19b6d4684934f00bc24b3545c/white-sox-spring-basesball.jpg, width=5100, height=3400}}], imageAlignment=null, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox, isFeatured=false, category=[{items=[White Sox]}], target=null, primaryMediaType=null, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2026/02/13/white-sox-spring-training-gaffes-chris-getz-luisangel-acuna-munetaka-murakami, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/steve-greenberg, media=[{ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=258097893_10227367806079844_1724022405929237952_n.jpg, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/11/58/fc94fb4e49bebd891825a398c8d4/258097893-10227367806079844-1724022405929237952-n.jpg, width=750, height=750}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/11/58/fc94fb4e49bebd891825a398c8d4/258097893-10227367806079844-1724022405929237952-n.jpg, width=750, height=750}}], bio=[{items=[Steve Greenberg is a sports columnist at the Chicago Sun-Times.]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, name=[{items=[Steve Greenberg]}], jobTitle=[{items=[Reporter/columnist, sports]}]}], timestamp=1771019609000, ampLink=null, audio=[], audioDuration=null, title=It&amp;#x27;s White Sox spring training.

ESPN reported that the parties had agreed to a two-year contract worth $2.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Source confirms the Cubs are working toward a multi-year deal with reliever Shelby Miller, as &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByRobertMurray?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;@ByRobertMurray&lt;/a&gt; first reported. It&amp;#39;s a move for the future – Miller is set to miss most or all of the 2026 season after undergoing offseason elbow surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Maddie Lee (@maddie_m_lee) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/maddie_m_lee/status/2022417879711559781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 13, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After undergoing offseason elbow surgery, Miller, 35, is likely to miss the 2026 season, barring a condensed rehab program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller was set to be a highly sought-after reliever at the trade deadline last year, after posting a 1.98 ERA for the Diamondbacks in 37 appearances and notching a career-high 10 saves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a few weeks before the deadline, Miller landed on the IL with a forearm injury. The Brewers, who already owned the best record in MLB but had the Cubs breathing down their necks at the time, still acquired Miller for their playoff push. But after 11 appearances, he landed on the IL again with a damaged ulnar collateral ligament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last season proved that when healthy, Miller could be a difference-maker in high-leverage situations. It was a new chapter in the 13-year veteran’s career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former first-rounder, Miller was a starting pitcher, and even earned an All-Star nod in 2015, until he had to chart a new path post-2017 Tommy John surgery. He went from swingman, to middle-inning reliever, to a trusted arm at the back-end of the bullpen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that journey, he made a pit stop with the Cubs in 2021. He made just three appearances and allowed seven runs in two innings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Celebrity sighting &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basketball Hall of Famer Charles Barkley could be spotted at the Cubs’ spring training complex on Friday, sporting a Cubs spring training hat and green track suit, zipping between fields on a golf cart with Cubs great Rick Sutcliffe and National Baseball Hall of Famer Fergie Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cubs manager Craig Counsell said he sat in his office for a half an hour with Barkley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was great,” Counsell said. “He’s wonderful. Wonderful heart – I think that's the thing that sticks out the most. He's a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;We’ll do it live&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday was the biggest day of live batting practice in camp so far. Seven pitchers were scheduled to throw to hitters on the backfields, including the Cubs’ top pitching prospect Jaxon Wiggins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“First big-league camp, this is a camp for him to learn, listen, pick things up, improve routines from watching older players who have had a lot of success go about their business,” Counsell said. “Set up a good foundation for the future, set up a good foundation for the season, and go from there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;WBC departures&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the Cubs’ World Baseball Classic participants are scheduled to leave camp on Feb. 28 to join their national teams, the Cubs said Friday. Thirteen players in the organization, including eight members of the 40-man roster, are on WBC rosters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right fielder Seiya Suzuki (Japan) and first baseman Jonathon Long (Chinese Taipei), a non-roster invitee, are the exceptions. Traveling to Tokyo for pool play, Suzuki is set to depart Feb. 23, and Long is expected to leave a couple days early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, title=Latest on the Cubs, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, pageCount=4565, items=[{type=Image, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, isFeatured=false, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/maddie-lee, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[], media=[], jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Cubs reporter]}], name=[{items=[Maddie Lee]}]}], target=null, primaryMediaType=null, timestamp=1770946454000, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/12/cubnt, media=[{ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=ST26-palencia-01-f5-8x12-350.jpg, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/13/8a/e61915c04929b35d848818541fd7/st26-palencia-01-f5-8x12-350.jpg, width=4200, height=2800}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/13/8a/e61915c04929b35d848818541fd7/st26-palencia-01-f5-8x12-350.jpg, width=4200, height=2800}}], publishDate=February 12, 2026 07:34 PM, title=Cubs&amp;#x27;

But on Wednesday, a group of about 20 people had lunch at D’Nuez, 4125 S. Archer Ave., then visited nearby small businesses in the Southwest Side neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were part of the Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce’s first “shop local” event to promote Chicago area small businesses affected by the federal deportation campaign. This month, the chamber announced its &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2026/02/05/illinois-hispanic-chamber-of-commerce-initiative-aims-to-help-latino-small-businesses\"   &gt;Resilient Communities Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, which includes grants of $1,500 to $5,000 for small businesses, as well as campaigns to promote struggling neighborhoods and boost commerce. Anyone can donate to the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ihccbusiness.net/resilientcommunitiesinitiative/microgrant/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;grant fund&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Illinois, the gross domestic product of Latinos normally exceeds $100 billion, according to the University of California Los Angeles Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chamber chose Brighton Park for its first shop local event because immigration raids had a major impact there. In October, U.S. Border Patrol agents in Brighton Park shot &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/11/evidence-shows-feds-lied-about-marimar-martinezs-shooting-in-chicago-attorney-says\"   &gt;Marimar Martinez&lt;/a&gt; five times. She survived, but the shooting sparked &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/10/04/shooting-involving-federal-agents-in-brighton-park-under-investigation\"   &gt;a confrontation&lt;/a&gt; in the neighborhood between nearly 100 protesters and federal agents, some in an armed personnel carrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, immigration agents often started their day in Brighton Park because there is a Home Depot nearby where laborers used to gather, said Hilda Alvarez, Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce’s special projects manager. More than 78% of Brighton Park residents are Latino, according to the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. Other communities hurt by immigration raids include Belmont Cragin, as well as Cicero, Berwyn and Elgin, Alvarez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Brighton Park, foot traffic has slowed dramatically along Archer Avenue’s commercial corridor. “People don’t feel safe going out and shopping like they normally do,” Alvarez said. Businesses also have fewer resources because Brighton Park doesn’t have a chamber of commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-9c0000\" name=\"image-9c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c7be6b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff2%2Fd6%2F8c4359cc492abdc975a1b32892b6%2Frestaurant-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-009.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c23290/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff2%2Fd6%2F8c4359cc492abdc975a1b32892b6%2Frestaurant-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-009.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1ed3d9c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff2%2Fd6%2F8c4359cc492abdc975a1b32892b6%2Frestaurant-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-009.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce members and staff eat at D&amp;#x27;Nuez in Brighton Park, 4125 S.

The chamber expects to organize more shop local events but hasn’t finalized locations or timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Wednesday’s lunch, Jaime di Paulo, CEO of the Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said the federal deportation campaign has affected the entire supply chain, including suppliers who are not Latino.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chamber’s new initiative is “trying to help businesses stay afloat. They generate tax revenue and employment and unify the community,” di Paulo said. “We are trying to give back to our community.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attendees at Wednesday’s event included chamber members, partners and allies, who toured Brighton Park’s local businesses after lunch. They included Ald. Julia Ramirez (12th), who represents Brighton Park, where she was born and raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear of immigration agents “deeply affected the business corridor. People don’t feel safe going out to eat or going to school,” Ramirez said. “But being here gives confidence that we’re in this together.

Aisles in his shop at 4207 S. Sacramento Ave. were packed with flower bouquets and stuffed animals with Valentine’s Day hearts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before immigration agents arrived last year, the store used to make $1,500 to $2,000 a day in sales. But now business has slowed and Galindo is only covering his bills. Last fall, there were “no people walking in. People were not buying,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was forced to let go of two employees. Now, only Galindo and his wife work at the store full time. Coping with the impact of immigration raids is more challenging than navigating the COVID-19 pandemic when people still bought flowers. Galindo said promotions like the shop local event can help. “It shows people where we are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down the street, Victor Vazquez, co-owner of Victor Mauricio Hair Salon, estimated he’s lost half of his business since last fall. “Raids were happening right here,” said Vazquez, who opened his salon 20 years ago. “People are scared. Even people who are documented canceled appointments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-630000\" name=\"image-630000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5f469b2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7077x3972+0+374/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F98%2Fc3%2Fcaff667c4634a686b90b619962b4%2Fvictor-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-035.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/880e619/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7077x3972+0+374/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F98%2Fc3%2Fcaff667c4634a686b90b619962b4%2Fvictor-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-035.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/25c41c5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7077x3972+0+374/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F98%2Fc3%2Fcaff667c4634a686b90b619962b4%2Fvictor-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-035.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Victor Vazquez, co-owner of Victor Mauricio Hair Salon, speaks with attendees of the Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;shop local&amp;quot; tour in Brighton Park.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/25c41c5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7077x3972+0+374/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F98%2Fc3%2Fcaff667c4634a686b90b619962b4%2Fvictor-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-035.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7f05b23/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7077x3972+0+374/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F98%2Fc3%2Fcaff667c4634a686b90b619962b4%2Fvictor-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-035.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/25c41c5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7077x3972+0+374/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F98%2Fc3%2Fcaff667c4634a686b90b619962b4%2Fvictor-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-035.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victor Vazquez, co-owner of Victor Mauricio Hair Salon, speaks with attendees of the Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce’s “shop local” tour in Brighton Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even during the pandemic, people still came to his spacious salon at 4235 S.

But after last year’s raids, customers haven’t returned. “The community doesn’t feel safe,” Vazquez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raul Velazquez opened Nevería La Flor De Mayo 15 years ago. Sales at his ice cream parlor and eatery have dropped 40% since September, he said. Velazquez let go of one employee and reduced hours for his remaining five workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many immigration agents left Chicago, business hasn't improved at La Flor De Mayo, 4151 S. Archer Ave. “There’s still a lot of fear,” Velazquez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jose Maya opened sports apparel store Deportes Maya, 4344 S. Archer Ave., more than 20 years ago. Sales have plummeted 70% since last August and haven't recovered at the shop filled with soccer jerseys. Construction along Archer Avenue has also dampened food traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked what could help small business owners like him, Maya replied firmly: “If ICE leaves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-750000\" name=\"image-750000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/baaf566/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F55%2F6a086f79461b9f1bd35a59b631b8%2Fflor-de-mayo-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-020.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/835a3a8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F55%2F6a086f79461b9f1bd35a59b631b8%2Fflor-de-mayo-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-020.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ea86ee4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F55%2F6a086f79461b9f1bd35a59b631b8%2Fflor-de-mayo-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-020.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Raul Velazquez, owner of ice cream parlor Neveria La Flor De Mayo\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ea86ee4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F55%2F6a086f79461b9f1bd35a59b631b8%2Fflor-de-mayo-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-020.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ece4785/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F55%2F6a086f79461b9f1bd35a59b631b8%2Fflor-de-mayo-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-020.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ea86ee4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F55%2F6a086f79461b9f1bd35a59b631b8%2Fflor-de-mayo-hispanicchamberlocal-260216-020.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raul Velazquez, owner of ice cream parlor Neveria La Flor De Mayo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/10/09/business-community-leaders-support-latino-il-hispanic-chamber-commerce-conference\"   &gt;Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce urges support for Latino communities under siege&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Devoted fans packed in tight and sang along to every word, some sporting wigs, angel wings and other recreations of the pop star’s looks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-070000\" name=\"image-070000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/152e032/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9a%2F66%2Fd632d8f243bcaab7cfb922d2dd63%2Fjade-260213005.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e9e3ad4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9a%2F66%2Fd632d8f243bcaab7cfb922d2dd63%2Fjade-260213005.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bc2e3b3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9a%2F66%2Fd632d8f243bcaab7cfb922d2dd63%2Fjade-260213005.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Jade performs at the House of Blues Chicago, Thursday, Feb. 12, 2026. | Melissa Tamez/For the Sun-Times\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bc2e3b3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9a%2F66%2Fd632d8f243bcaab7cfb922d2dd63%2Fjade-260213005.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3e7b72/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9a%2F66%2Fd632d8f243bcaab7cfb922d2dd63%2Fjade-260213005.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bc2e3b3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9a%2F66%2Fd632d8f243bcaab7cfb922d2dd63%2Fjade-260213005.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;JADE emerges from a miniature stage during her performance Thursday at the House of Blues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa Tamez/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an 11-year stint with the popular girl group Little Mix, she released her debut album, “That’s Showbiz, Baby,” in September, a masterful blend of several eras of pop music, including 1960s Motown-style choruses, 1970s disco grooves, 1980s synth pop, Y2K bubble gum hooks, 2010s EDM-centered anthems, and the unhinged ethos of hyperpop. Beneath the catchy, saccharine surface is a meditation on the music industry — its predatory contracts, impossible standards for young women, bloodlust for capital over creativity and the pressure to grin, bear it and put on a good show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday’s delicate dance with grim and glitz and composure and camp began with Ethel Merman’s voice, warbling, “There’s no business like show business,” as a miniature stage was wheeled before the audience, adorned with red velvet curtains. JADE’s two dancers twirled with large black-feathered fans and a showman’s voiceover encouraged audience members to “forget real life” and “live the full fantasy” — making for a smoke-filled cabaret illusion, aided by House of Blues’ ornate, gold-flecked stage and eccentric hand-painted decor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The crowd broke into deafening cheers at the sight of JADE’s arm reaching from behind the curtain and the sound of her singing the beginning bars of “FUFN (F--- You For Now),” a slow-building synth pop number with shades of early Lady Gaga. She eventually stepped through the frame as the curtain was pulled. She shimmered in a black long-sleeve jumpsuit, seemingly covered in hundreds of sequins, a feathered tutu and and silver chain pasties to compound the campy cabaret nod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-ab0000\" name=\"image-ab0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/10f5cdd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8d%2F40%2F9803c16b4e239262df1d199a428d%2Fjade-260213014.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bfa94fc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8d%2F40%2F9803c16b4e239262df1d199a428d%2Fjade-260213014.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8f3e208/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8d%2F40%2F9803c16b4e239262df1d199a428d%2Fjade-260213014.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Jade performs Thursday at the House of Blues Chicago.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8f3e208/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8d%2F40%2F9803c16b4e239262df1d199a428d%2Fjade-260213014.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/104c9da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8d%2F40%2F9803c16b4e239262df1d199a428d%2Fjade-260213014.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8f3e208/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8d%2F40%2F9803c16b4e239262df1d199a428d%2Fjade-260213014.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jade performs Thursday before a sold-out crowd at the House of Blues Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melissa Tamez/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One highlight in a night full of many came when she performed “Glitch. Her dancers shadowed her, jutting out their bodies in fits and starts as she pretended to battle them, while reaching in her upper register to sing about fighting her inner demons, before working in chair choreography reminiscent of 1990s Britney Spears. That blended into a cover of Madonna’s “Frozen,” from 1998, which saw JADE belt over deep synths and Giorgio Moroder-like arpeggios that built into a fast-paced Italian disco scene, complete with flashing lights and spinning mirror ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JADE’s references are a culmination of a life spent performing and more than 15 years in the music industry — staking her own claim in pop history. Born Jade Thirlwall, the 33-year-old got her start on the “X Factor,” where she was eventually signed to Simon Cowell’s record label as a member of Little Mix in 2011. Several world tours, albums and chart-topping singles later, the group halted in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unmoored, she embarked on a solo venture — a daunting feat, she said in between songs on Thursday. She said that writing her solo debut motivated her to turn inward, be vulnerable and also reflect on her career so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-b40000\" name=\"image-b40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/75981d0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F64%2F54%2Fb2e9f0ef4b489cc4911b9967ab9b%2Fjade-260213007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dd793b5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F64%2F54%2Fb2e9f0ef4b489cc4911b9967ab9b%2Fjade-260213007.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/176ce8d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F64%2F54%2Fb2e9f0ef4b489cc4911b9967ab9b%2Fjade-260213007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Jade performs Thursday at the House of Blues Chicago.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/176ce8d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F64%2F54%2Fb2e9f0ef4b489cc4911b9967ab9b%2Fjade-260213007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8055202/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F64%2F54%2Fb2e9f0ef4b489cc4911b9967ab9b%2Fjade-260213007.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/176ce8d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x2759+0+263/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F64%2F54%2Fb2e9f0ef4b489cc4911b9967ab9b%2Fjade-260213007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jade performs Thursday at the House of Blues Chicago.

In the Name of Love.” She cited Diana Ross as her idol, before singing while clad in a sparkling silver robe covered in tinsel and a cape connected to her dancers — think &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/5/18/22441861/nick-cave-retrospective-museum-of-contemporary-art-chicago\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Nick Cave&lt;/a&gt; at Studio 54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being a triumph for the pop veteran and an opportunity to revel in creative autonomy, Thursday also worked as a kind of payoff for her fans.

Like “It Girl,” the song speaks to the harrowing, bittersweet pursuit of a pop career. She beckoned the crowd to sing the chorus a capella with her, a tender moment interrupted by the song’s brilliantly abrasive structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She disappeared in a foggy darkness as strobe lights flashed, resurfacing in the spotlight with a large pair of wings and prop arrows to her chest. Singing “I’ll always love you,” she doubled over in a moment of high drama, inspiring rapturous cheers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intensity was cut by the return of the campy burlesque music and voiceover, telling the crowd to put their hands together. She rose, smiled and bowed, having toyed with the thin veil between pure emotion and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It capped an electrifying gig by a devout music fan and innovator coveting her unique position as pop’s genre’s past, present and future.&lt;/p&gt;",

It was a good call, too, because the Cubs would end up flying the “W” 103 times and — stop us if you’ve heard this before — winning the World Series for the first time since 1908.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Cubs weren’t the only local team stirring imaginations. The self-monikered “Nation’s Newspaper” was also high on the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;White Sox&lt;/a&gt;, pegging them to finish tied atop the American League at 90-72 despite their streak of three straight losing seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sun-Times, too, was relatively smitten, with a Sox story that same day saying, “[Their] seven-season playoff drought is among the longest in the AL, but the additions of Todd Frazier, Brett Lawrie, Alex Avila and Mat Latos — coupled with one of the best rotations in the league — should make the Sox contenders once again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the big reveal: Did it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come on, of course it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those Sox got off to a red-hot 23-10 start, then imploded over the next month, going 6-20 to fall below .500 for the first time at 29-30. They traded for starting pitcher James Shields just in time for the veteran right-hander to take team loss No. 30 in his Sox debut, a disastrous outing against the Nationals in which he gave up four first-inning runs and then — enter cascading boos from the crowd at Rate Field — back-to-back homers to start the second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t just Shields who made believers in the 2016 Sox stare down at their shoes and kick the dirt in disappointment, wishing for a do-over. The front office’s decision to bring back manager Robin Ventura for a fifth year made little sense. The Sox didn’t do anything to address a subpar outfield and, in a doomed-from-the-start move, handed the catcher’s gear to Dioner Navarro. Jose Abreu had a struggle-filled first half. The Sox went ice-cold in clutch hitting situations. Throughout, there was rancor between players and management stemming in part from the oft-revisited Adam LaRoche fiasco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox ended up in fourth place, initiating an all-out rebuild. Perhaps needless to say, there have been far more bad times than good ones since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the walk down memory lane? What does 2016 have to do with right now, when the Sox are in a completely different rebuild headed by a largely different regime?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, nothing, really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, that’s not true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is it’s hard to believe in the Sox no matter who’s in charge. Admittedly, this is partly just a reflex. But also, it’s the middle of February — has spring training even started yet? — and already &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2026/02/12/chris-getz-luisangel-acuna-switch-hitter\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;the Sox are committing little gaffes&lt;/a&gt; that might make anyone question what’s going on here, that might make anyone feel creeping, all-too-familiar doubt about this organization doing little things well enough to accomplish big things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2026/02/12/chris-getz-luisangel-acuna-switch-hitter\"   &gt;White Sox GM Chris Getz laughs off his mistakes about Luisangel Acuña being a switch hitter&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2026/02/12/noah-schultz-hagen-smith-white-sox-spring-training-triple-a\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;White Sox top pitching prospects Noah Schultz, Hagen Smith on track for ’26 debuts — just not Opening Day&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By now, you’re probably aware that general manager Chris Getz has repeatedly, and inaccurately, referred in interviews to new Sox player Luisangel Acuna — the top returning piece in last month’s trade of Luis Robert Jr. to the Mets — as a switch-hitter. It’s possible Acuna sinks putts or forks linguini from the left side, but he swings at baseballs from the right side only. This is the sort of thing whoever delivers the mail to Camelback Ranch might get wrong, but the GM ought to be a different story. It’s more than a little odd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So I probably have been getting carried away describing his versatility,” Getz explained in a statement delivered via a team spokesman. “He can play every position on the field. Why does it have to stop there? I called Luisangel and told him that even though he’s just right-handed, we still love him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, hardly the end of the world. We can even give Getz a couple of points for the dry humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He misspoke,” assistant GM Josh Barfield said, “but in typical Getzy fashion, he kind of lets it roll off his back and we just keep going.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Sox also misspelled prized newcomer Munetaka Murakami’s name (“Munetaki”) on the nameplate above the Japanese slugger’s locker. And they didn’t stop there, misspelling pitching prospect Jairo Iriarte’s name (“Iriate”) on his jersey. Not exactly huge missteps — and certainly not on Getz, who neither engraves nor stitches for a living — but, again, what’s going on here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaRoche abruptly leaving the team during spring training in 2016, after then-vice president Kenny Williams told him to stop bringing his 14-year-old son into the clubhouse every day, was as awkward as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The return of Tony La Russa as manager in 2021 — a Jerry Reinsdorf special delivery — was like something out of “The Twilight Zone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then-GM Rick Hahn having to explain on the first day of camp in 2023 that the team had signed pitcher Mike Clevinger without knowing he was under league investigation for allegations of domestic abuse was a four-egg omelet on the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring isn’t nearly as eggy, not yet, but it’s already a bit embarrassing.

Marty Quinn’s decision to throw in the towel means that hemp-derived products can continue to be sold in Chicago — at least until a federal ban takes effect later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ban on most hemp products was aimed at keeping unregulated intoxicants out of reach from minors. Johnson used his first veto to kill a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2025/07/16/snap-curfew-veto-upheld-mayor-johnson-city-council-vote\"   &gt;snap curfew ordinance&lt;/a&gt; and made it stick by preventing a 34-vote override. His second veto will also stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinn (13th) muscled the ban through the City Council by a vote of 32 to 16.  But he said he won’t pursue an override he knows he can’t win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have the votes… I’m at 32. I don’t have 34. That’s where it’s at. It’s not going to change,” said Quinn, who learned his vote-counting skills while serving as chief lieutenant for now convicted and imprisoned former Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan, D-Chicago. “I still have the ban on the Southwest Side in the Midway [Airport] region and I would anticipate other alders doing the same thing in their wards” in addition to the seven wards where hemp products are already banned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinn said the mayor will now have to live with the consequences of “placing business over the safety of kids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-5a0000\" name=\"image-5a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b8e7b5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6379x3580+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2Fe6%2F433431f04e24a2df5f0828905151%2Fcouncil-121125-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/602cdd0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6379x3580+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2Fe6%2F433431f04e24a2df5f0828905151%2Fcouncil-121125-09.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/110ed06/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6379x3580+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2Fe6%2F433431f04e24a2df5f0828905151%2Fcouncil-121125-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Ald.

There must be zero tolerance for businesses that market or sell these products to minors,” the mayor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Johnson said he is also concerned about the impact that the “prohibition style ban” could have on small businesses in general and minority-owned businesses in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ordinance protects some establishments at the expense of many of our small businesses who have been following the law and deserve to have a seat at the table,” he said. “Many of these businesses are Black- and brown-owned. Many are operated by entrepreneurs who were shut out of the expensive cannabis licensing process and turned to federally legal hemp as a pathway into the marketplace. We cannot claim to support equitable economic development while advancing policies that concentrate the market in the hands of a few large entities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Business Affairs and Consumer Protection Commissioner Ivan Capifali has warned that a full ban “would be nearly impossible to enforce” and threaten “hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs.”   During a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/fran-spielman-show/2026/02/12/chicago-taxicab-industry-fare-hike-proposal-business-affairs-commissioner-ivan-capifali\"   &gt;Sun-Times podcast&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, Capifali reiterated those concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My job is not to shut down businesses. My job is to help businesses expand and grow and scale,” Capifali said. “When you put bans like this that will shut down businesses that, their whole model is around hemp, it pains us. Anything that is not business friendly is something that we have a problem with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinn took aim at that argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s what you’re propping up? Dodgy storefronts as a marketing tool for the city of Chicago? Oh, my God. That’s absurd,” Quinn said. “You’re going to talk about these small businesses that were opened up on a loophole under the disguise of night as a good thing? It defies logic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hemp-infused beverages have soared in popularity and kept many bars and restaurants afloat as consumer trends have shifted away from alcohol since the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a close vote in committee, Quinn tweaked the full-on ban to allow for hemp beverages to be produced and sold by licensed vendors, after pushback from the Illinois Restaurant Association and other industry leaders. Creams and ointments also would have been exempt from the citywide ban, and hemp products would have been allowed for animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retailers licensed to sell cannabis products would have been allowed to sell hemp-infused beverages, powders and crystalline additives to customers over 21, provided they include “no more than 10 milligrams.” Hemp-infused beverages and additives could also have been sold at bars, restaurants with incidental liquor licenses and packaged goods stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson’s administration opposed the measure because of the small-business boon from the 2018 loophole in federal law that allowed delta-8 THC and other hemp derivatives to proliferate without the restrictions placed on Illinois’ heavily regulated cannabis industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That loophole is set to close later this year, prompting Quinn’s push to close it down in the city even sooner. The ban on the sale of hemp products to minors would have taken effect in 10 days, but other provisions would be pushed back until April 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the day the ban was approved, Johnson said he had “some real serious concerns about this ordinance” and hadn’t decided on a potential veto. “It’s paramount for the good of our city [not only] to regulate, have the ability to actually test, to actually regulate what was passed and to keep people safe, but ultimately to make sure that we’re not driving small businesses out of it,” Johnson said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois Hemp Business Association Director Charles Wu has argued that Quinn’s ordinance came down to “economic favoritism” for the cannabis and alcohol industry over the burgeoning hemp industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am not here asking for special treatment. I am asking for clear rules, consistent enforcement and a path to compliance that applies equally to everyone,” Wu told Council members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-390000\" name=\"image-390000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/817114b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F42%2Fea%2Fbf92546044a289321ba24095a6f2%2Fpritzkerdelta8-121424-4.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/006c644/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F42%2Fea%2Fbf92546044a289321ba24095a6f2%2Fpritzkerdelta8-121424-4.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba9c05b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F42%2Fea%2Fbf92546044a289321ba24095a6f2%2Fpritzkerdelta8-121424-4.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Jeremy Dedic, an owner of Cubbington’s Cabinet, plays with his dog Cubbington inside his North Center business, Friday, Dec. 13, 2024. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba9c05b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F42%2Fea%2Fbf92546044a289321ba24095a6f2%2Fpritzkerdelta8-121424-4.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/871af3e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F42%2Fea%2Fbf92546044a289321ba24095a6f2%2Fpritzkerdelta8-121424-4.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba9c05b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F42%2Fea%2Fbf92546044a289321ba24095a6f2%2Fpritzkerdelta8-121424-4.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Dedic, an owner of Cubbington’s Cabinet, with his dog Cubbington inside his hemp wellness retailer in Roscoe Village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeremy Dedic, co-founder of Cubbington’s Cabinet, a hemp wellness retailer in Roscoe Village, applauded Johnson for vetoing an ordinance that “would have shut us down” and deprived Chicagoans of access to what he called “non-inebriating solutions” for an array of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Hemp products are popular because they can help people sleep, manage stress and anxiety, reduce inflammation and minimize side effects of cancer treatment” and post-traumatic stress disorder, Dedic said. “It’s dishonest saying it’s about protecting the children or public safety. What it’s really doing is trying to provide carve-outs and a monopoly for your multi-state operators of marijuana dispensary operations and the alcohol industry.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the hemp ban is history, Dedic encouraged the City Council to  focus on “common sense regulation” that “supports public safety and protects kids, but also supports Chicago’s economy [and]  consumer access to wellness products.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ban sales of any hemp-cannabinoid products to anyone under the age of 21. Ban these look-alike products that keep being held up…that appeal to kids. Require… product testing from independent third party labs,” Dedic said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 allowed THC to be extracted from hemp and concentrated into an array of products with chemical compositions nearly identical to marijuana but that aren’t classified as drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ve sometimes been marketed to kids with packaging styled after popular candy, prompting outcry from hemp industry critics, including Gov. JB Pritzker. Hemp businesses have invited taxation and regulation, calling for an age minimum of 21 and standards for testing and labeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State lawmakers&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2024/12/13/pritzker-delta-8-hemp-ban-cannabis-industry-kimberly-lightford\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;butted heads for years&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;over how to regulate the booming industry, but a late provision tacked onto the federal spending bill to reopen the government last fall promised to close the hemp THC loophole&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/business/2025/11/12/hemp-ban-federal-spending-bill-illinois-business-reopen-government\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;by November&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;unless Congress takes additional action.

Después, querían saber si era seguro regresar a la escuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No sabía qué decir”, contó Alma, quien prefirió que la identificaran sólo por su nombre porque es inmigrante y teme ser objeto de ataques. “Les dije que estarían a salvo dentro de la escuela y que sólo tenían que estar listos en caso de que sucediera de nuevo”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-dc0000\" name=\"module-dc0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alma también ha preparado a sus gemelos por si un agente federal cuestiona su ciudadanía estadounidense.

Los estudiantes, tanto de familias inmigrantes como sus compañeros, dicen que el ambiente tenso los dejó mirando por encima del hombro y sin poder concentrarse en las tareas escolares, mirando frecuentemente a las puertas del salón o preocupándose por sus familiares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;También impuso una carga sin precedentes sobre los directores de escuelas y funcionarios del distrito escolar, quienes debían garantizar una comunicación oportuna con las familias sin sembrar miedo ni propagar rumores. Los miembros de la comunidad dicen que la coordinación con CPS fue difícil al principio y mejoró con el tiempo, pero el distrito aún enfrenta un gran desafío si regresan las ejecuciones masivas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No creo que estemos donde necesitamos estar”, dijo Patrick Brosnan, director ejecutivo del Brighton Park Neighborhood Council, organización sin fines de lucro en el lado suroeste de la ciudad que trabaja estrechamente con las escuelas. Reconoce al distrito por hacer ajustes para enfrentar lo que él llama una situación “loca”. Al mismo tiempo, dijo que el distrito escolar y la Municipalidad aún necesitan compartir información de manera más libre y rápida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-6ed476\" name=\"image-6ed476\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3d0ec78/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+117/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2F13%2Fdb09afd941d6ac444e0de11c2cab%2Fdisruptedlogo.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba4114d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+117/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2F13%2Fdb09afd941d6ac444e0de11c2cab%2Fdisruptedlogo.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7453ce9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+117/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2F13%2Fdb09afd941d6ac444e0de11c2cab%2Fdisruptedlogo.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Disrupted series logo updated\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7453ce9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+117/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2F13%2Fdb09afd941d6ac444e0de11c2cab%2Fdisruptedlogo.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0494f7f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+117/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2F13%2Fdb09afd941d6ac444e0de11c2cab%2Fdisruptedlogo.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7453ce9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+117/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F00%2F13%2Fdb09afd941d6ac444e0de11c2cab%2Fdisruptedlogo.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric White/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No hay un plan para esto, pero estamos atravesándolo”, agregó Yesenia López, miembro de la junta de CPS cuyo distrito, mayormente latino, en el lado suroeste de la ciudad, ha sido una zona de conflicto para los operativos. “Las cosas siguen escalando en función de lo que hemos visto en otros estados y tendremos que seguir actuando rápidamente como distrito”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Interrupciones generalizadas cuando los agentes federales se acercaron a las escuelas de Chicago&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuando la campaña de deportaciones de Trump en el área de Chicago estaba en su punto más alto el otoño pasado, las escuelas informaron que los agentes de inmigración federales se estaban posicionando en los estacionamientos de las escuelas, apareciendo en los partidos de fútbol de las escuelas primarias y deteniendo a personas en los terrenos escolares o en lugares donde los estudiantes podían verlos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El 3 de octubre, los estudiantes tuvieron que quedarse adentro cuando los agentes federales &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2025/10/09/escuelas-publicas-de-chicago-crean-un-comite-para-monitorear-la-actividad-de-ice\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;lanzaron gas lacrimógeno en la calle cerca de la Primaria Funston&lt;/a&gt; en el vecindario de Logan Square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aunque no se conoce el número exacto de veces que la actividad federal interrumpió las escuelas, está claro que el efecto fue generalizado. El Sun-Times y WBEZ compilaron el recuento más completo hasta la fecha revisando los informes del distrito para los miembros de la junta escolar y los registros de cartas que CPS envió a las familias informándoles sobre la actividad federal cerca de sus escuelas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS recibió casi 200 llamadas de apoyo de 109 escuelas entre el 20 de octubre, cuando abrió un centro de comando para centralizar las llamadas de asistencia, hasta mediados de diciembre, según documentos de CPS obtenidos a través de una solicitud de registros abiertos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-a30000\" name=\"html-embed-module-a30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27483195\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27483195/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eso probablemente es una subestimación de cuántas veces los agentes se acercaron a las escuelas, ya que los directores a menudo actuaron sin comunicarse con la oficina central y el centro de comando se lanzó más de un mes después del inicio de la campaña de deportación.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los funcionarios de CPS no accedieron a realizar una entrevista, pero dijeron en un comunicado que la actividad federal en los terrenos escolares es extremadamente rara y que el distrito ha respondido mayormente a informes de actividad cerca de los edificios escolares. En el último año, no ha habido instancias conocidas de actividad federal dentro de una escuela de CPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aun así, las escuelas llamaron al centro de comando para pedir ayuda casi todos los días en octubre y principios de noviembre. En algunos días, CPS recibió docenas de llamadas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Por ejemplo, cuando el 24 de octubre los agentes federales inundaron el lado norte y noroeste, el centro de comando recibió 37 llamadas de escuelas solicitando ayuda, la mayor cantidad registrada por el distrito ese otoño.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al menos 10 escuelas consideraron que la situación representaba un riesgo suficiente para la seguridad del personal y de los estudiantes como para entrar en cierre de emergencia, según un registro de mensajes que el distrito envió a los padres. Eso significa que mantuvieron a los estudiantes en el interior y aseguraron las puertas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Secundaria North-Grand en el vecindario de Humboldt Park entró en cierre de emergencia a principios de septiembre tras recibir informes de varios vehículos sospechosos de la ley en el estacionamiento de un centro comercial adyacente. Los funcionarios de CPS no pudieron verificar a quién pertenecían los vehículos, pero los estudiantes supusieron que los estaban utilizando agentes de inmigración federales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-893eeb\" name=\"image-893eeb\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a8ef4cb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+58/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F45%2F998d0d6c4f8a88298eed661a193f%2Fcpslockdowns-260128-9.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/983bf59/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+58/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F45%2F998d0d6c4f8a88298eed661a193f%2Fcpslockdowns-260128-9.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ec3b09/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+58/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F45%2F998d0d6c4f8a88298eed661a193f%2Fcpslockdowns-260128-9.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Un grupo de ocho estudiantes, vestidos con abrigos y mochilas, camina en fila junto a un estacionamiento separado de la carretera por una cerca negra.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ec3b09/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+58/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F45%2F998d0d6c4f8a88298eed661a193f%2Fcpslockdowns-260128-9.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b89e645/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+58/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F45%2F998d0d6c4f8a88298eed661a193f%2Fcpslockdowns-260128-9.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6ec3b09/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+58/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F45%2F998d0d6c4f8a88298eed661a193f%2Fcpslockdowns-260128-9.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuando vehículos de la policía sospechosos aparecieron en un estacionamiento cerca de la Secundaria North-Grand en Humboldt Park, la escuela entró en un estado de alerta máxima.

No usamos su nombre real porque algunos de sus familiares son inmigrantes sin estatus legal en Estados Unidos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ese día, la estudiante de North-Grand envió mensajes de texto en pánico a sus familiares, diciéndoles que evitaran pasar por el área de la escuela. Empezó a llorar cuando no recibió respuesta, preocupada de haber enviado la advertencia demasiado tarde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Le estaba enviando un mensaje de texto a mi madre diciéndole que la quería mucho”, dijo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Después del cierre de emergencia, Carrie decidió quedarse en casa de la escuela durante algunos días. Regresar significaba trabajar con sus ansiedades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero la experiencia dejó una huella. Sigue en alerta máxima mientras está en clase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Miro más hacia la puerta, presto atención a quién está en la entrada, quién está saliendo, quién está en mi salón y quién podría estar caminando por los pasillos”, contó Carrie. “He memorizado algunos de los patrones de los pasos de mis amigos”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No es raro que los temores sobre la presencia de agentes de inmigración pesen mucho en la mente de los niños, dicen los psicólogos. Pueden volverse más emocionales, desconfíar de la autoridad y tienen dificultades para dormir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Podríamos estar pidiéndoles que hagan su examen de historia durante el noveno período cuando su mente está preocupada por el viaje a casa”, dijo Claudio Rivera, psicólogo pediátrico y profesor asistente en la Universidad de Chicago. “Eso no les permite concentrarse en las oportunidades de aprendizaje que tienen frente a ellos”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El número exacto de escuelas que entraron en cierre de emergencia durante el otoño probablemente sea mayor, ya que el distrito no los rastrea de manera exhaustiva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Por ejemplo, en octubre Brosnan declaró a Chalkbeat Chicago que cerca de 30 escuelas en el lado suroeste entraron en cierre de emergencia debido a la actividad de cumplimiento. López, cuyo distrito incluye Brighton Park, dijo que eso se debe en parte a que los agentes federales frecuentemente &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2025/09/30/ice-arresta-a-tamalera-en-back-of-the-yards-lanzan-gofundme-para-ayudar-a-vendedores-ambulantes\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;acosaban el Home Depot en el vecindario de Back of the Yards&lt;/a&gt;, que está rodeado por varias escuelas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-78e55f\" name=\"image-78e55f\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fb706c0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fa5%2F7b931de947e78ba7b153e723478c%2Fcpslockdowns-260205-01.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/40e51f9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fa5%2F7b931de947e78ba7b153e723478c%2Fcpslockdowns-260205-01.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/395621e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fa5%2F7b931de947e78ba7b153e723478c%2Fcpslockdowns-260205-01.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Julia Markut, estudiante de tercer año en la Secundaria Lane Tech, vio cómo la presencia de agentes federales de inmigración cerca de su escuela afectó la salud mental de sus compañeros.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/395621e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fa5%2F7b931de947e78ba7b153e723478c%2Fcpslockdowns-260205-01.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/02a6fe5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fa5%2F7b931de947e78ba7b153e723478c%2Fcpslockdowns-260205-01.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/395621e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe6%2Fa5%2F7b931de947e78ba7b153e723478c%2Fcpslockdowns-260205-01.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julia Markut, estudiante de tercer año en la Secundaria Lane Tech, vio cómo la presencia de agentes federales de inmigración cerca de su escuela afectó la salud mental de sus compañeros e hizo que algunos estudiantes tuvieran miedo de salir del edificio durante el almuerzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;En la Secundaria Lane Tech, localizada en el vecindario de North Center, la estudiante Julia Markut dijo que sus compañeros se sorprendieron cuando en octubre un mensaje por altavoz les alertó sobre una actividad de cumplimiento migratorio federal cercana. Observó, impresionada, cómo una de sus amigas se puso a llorar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Su amiga dijo, “No sé cómo voy a poder volver a casa, tengo que llamar a mis padres”, contó Markut. “Fue un poco deshumanizante ver cómo ella vivía eso”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pronto, las alertas por altavoz comenzaron a llegar varias veces a la semana, lo que hizo que la situación se volviera casi “normalizada”, dijo Markut. La escuela empezó a alentar a los estudiantes, muchos de los cuales disfrutan salir a almorzar, a que se quedaran adentro. Abrió salones donde los estudiantes que tienen miedo de salir pueden encontrar refugio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero Julia piensa que no debería ser así.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Este miedo no debería formar parte de nuestra rutina”, dijo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS) no respondió a múltiples solicitudes para responder preguntas específicas sobre la actividad federal alrededor de las escuelas de Chicago. La agencia ha dicho que sus agentes no tienen como objetivo las escuelas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Las escuelas tuvieron que desarrollar un manual de comunicación sobre la actividad federal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;La imprevisibilidad de las acciones de cumplimiento migratorio dificultó a CPS descubrir cómo y cuándo informar a las familias sobre la actividad cerca de las escuelas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kia Banks, presidenta de la Asociación de Directores y Administradores de Chicago, el sindicato que representa a los directores de CPS, dijo que en el pasado, las escuelas iniciaban cierres de emergencia siguiendo un protocolo establecido, generalmente en respuesta a algo como un tiroteo, y coordinaban con el Departamento de Policía de Chicago (CPD) y el distrito escolar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero ese protocolo se alteró cuando los agentes federales se acercaron repetidamente a las escuelas. Las organizaciones comunitarias y las escuelas estaban alertando a CPS, en lugar de lo contrario, y coordinar con el distrito para comunicar a los padres podía llevar horas. Por lo tanto, especialmente en los primeros días del operativo de inmigración federal, muchos directores de Chicago tomaron sus propias decisiones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No hay un libro de instrucciones para manejar este nivel de emergencia”, dijo Banks. “Te sientes abrumado con la responsabilidad de proteger a tu comunidad escolar y haces lo que sabes hacer”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Graves, director de la primaria Jordan en el vecindario Rogers Park, sabe cómo se siente eso.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En su comunidad, los padres se estaban enterando de la actividad de cumplimiento migratorio a través de sus propias redes o escuchando las alertas de los patrulleros del vecindario. Esperar dos horas para obtener permiso de CPS para notificar a las familias sobre los agentes de inmigración federales en el área era demasiado tiempo, dijo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aprendió que las familias preferían que la escuela reconociera la situación en tiempo real, incluso si era para decir que la aparición de agentes no estaba confirmada. “Eso ayudó a crear un gran sentido de calma, porque las familias veían que constantemente estábamos comunicando algo”, contó Graves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El distrito proporcionó eventualmente a los líderes escolares una orientación más clara sobre cómo gestionar la actividad de cumplimiento migratorio cerca de sus edificios. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/78/b0/f53090534ffba3c272f450ff45e5/october-2025-cps-guidance.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Presentada en octubre&lt;/a&gt;, les instruye a los líderes escolares a llevar a los estudiantes y al personal adentro y asegurar las puertas si está ocurriendo actividad federal en la misma cuadra. Si está más lejos, deben monitorear la actividad. Eso es algo en lo que los miembros de la comunidad y los equipos de respuesta rápida pueden ayudar, destacó López.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los miembros de la junta escolar y los directores dicen que la comunicación mejoró una vez que las escuelas tuvieron una línea directa única para llamar y el distrito dio luz verde a los líderes escolares para que usen su propio criterio para actuar rápidamente.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-f90000\" name=\"html-embed-module-f90000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-map\" data-src=\"visualisation/27482980\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27482980/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"map visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasos como este han ayudado a estudiantes como Dennise Marioni, estudiante de octavo grado en Gunsaulus Scholastic Academy. Los padres dijeron que la escuela del vecindario de  Brighton Park mantuvo a los estudiantes en el interior varias veces el otoño pasado, pero Marioni dijo que la clara comunicación de la escuela la mantuvo tranquila. Además, frecuentemente el personal establecía un perímetro alrededor de la escuela durante las salidas o llegadas para monitorear a los agentes federales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Están manteniéndonos seguros”, dijo Marioni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS señaló en un comunicado que &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.cps.edu/services-and-supports/new-presidential-administration-guidance/immigration-resources\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;el personal del distrito y los líderes escolares trabajaron&lt;/a&gt; para “tomar decisiones rápidas y en tiempo real en respuesta a las condiciones cambiantes fuera de los campus escolares”. El distrito capacitó al personal sobre cómo responder a las campañas de cumplimiento en la primavera de 2025, y repitió la capacitación en el otoño cuando las acciones se intensificaron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS también ha proporcionado orientación al personal sobre qué hacer si un padre o tutor de un estudiante es detenido durante el horario escolar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“El distrito reconoce que estas circunstancias impusieron demandas extraordinarias a los directores y al personal de la oficina central, quienes trabajaron diligentemente para mantener a los estudiantes seguros a la vez que comunicaban con precisión y responsabilidad a las familias”, escribió un portavoz de CPS en un correo electrónico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;López dijo que, aunque CPS hizo grandes avances durante un evento sin precedentes, el distrito puede ser más proactivo al prepararse para el &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/12/04/doj-lawyer-warns-midway-blitz-is-not-over-as-judge-considers-lawsuits-dismissal\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;posible regreso de las ejecuciones masivas&lt;/a&gt;

Allí, agentes federales detuvieron a un niño de 5 años de edad &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/us/valley-view-elementary-minnesota-children-ice-detention.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;de camino a casa desde la escuela&lt;/a&gt; y desplegaron irritantes químicos y atacaron a varias personas en una secundaria en el sur de Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Más cerca de casa, agentes federales enmascarados escanearon el rostro de un adolescente de 16 años de edad afuera de una secundaria en Aurora, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/News-Room/Current-News/001%20-%20Complaint%201.12.26.pdf?language_id=1\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;según registros judiciales&lt;/a&gt;, lo que puede dar a los agentes acceso a información personal sensible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La administración de Trump también ha dicho a los agentes federales que tienen amplios poderes para arrestar a personas sin órdenes y entrar en hogares con una orden que no ha sido firmada por un juez. Esto ha dejado a los directores de Chicago deseando más orientación del distrito si los agentes federales aplican esa lógica a las escuelas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Urban, maestra de educación especial en la Secundaria North-Grand, dijo que los maestros han tratado de no permitir que la situación afecte sus salones, pero ha sido difícil ignorarla. Urban estaba enseñando una unidad sobre la Constitución de Estados Unidos en otoño cuando la actividad de cumplimiento migratorio aumentó.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cada vez que mirábamos la Carta de Derechos, había un signo de interrogación, diciendo: ‘Bueno, ¿pero realmente tengo estos derechos?’”, contó  Urban. “Había un sentido de tristeza, de trauma, pero también de injusticia porque los jóvenes entienden lo que está sucediendo en el mundo que los rodea”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Not the case for &lt;b&gt;Ryan Borucki&lt;/b&gt;, who teared up as an 11-year-old watching his beloved &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;White Sox&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the 2005 World Series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was a huge [&lt;b&gt;Scott&lt;/b&gt;] &lt;b&gt;Podsednik&lt;/b&gt; fan, so when he hit that walk-off in Game 2, I think I started crying when it happened,” said Borucki, a Mundelein High School product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Borucki’s rubbing his eyes as he fights for a spot in the bullpen on the team whose players covered the walls of his boyhood room in the north suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s awesome. Growing up a White Sox fan, just definitely a dream come true to be able to put this uniform on. As a kid, I used to always put it on, acting like I was on the White Sox in my backyard,” he said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My golden guy was &lt;b&gt;Mark Buehrle&lt;/b&gt;,” said Borucki, a not-quite-as-soft-tossing lefty who took his idol’s No. 56 while playing in Toronto from 2018-22, followed by a short stint last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox great’s number obviously isn’t for the taking at Camelback Ranch — it was retired &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2017/6/23/18391471/unflappable-mark-buehrle-all-set-to-have-white-sox-no-56-retired\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;almost a decade ago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — so Borucki is wearing 43 as he tries to lock down a relief role. He’s in camp on a minor-league deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borucki, who turns 32 next month, has posted a 4.28 ERA since debuting in 2018. The 6-4 hurler’s best season as a reliever came with the Pirates in 2023 when he was 4-0 with a 2.45 ERA and 0.74 WHIP across 38 appearances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That success came after a brief stop in the Cubs organization, though he didn’t appear in a game for his other hometown team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I never liked the Cubs when I was growing up and it didn't really end well,” laughed Borucki, who lives in Florida but whose parents remain in Mundelein. “I don't even consider them a team that I played for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But count him in for all other things Chicago, especially the Bears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love this city. It means so much to me.  … I'll just watch Bears highlights of this past season. I still get chills,” Borucki said. “They were a very inspirational team for all Chicago sports. So it's like, why not us?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No reason to think otherwise for manager &lt;b&gt;Will Venable&lt;/b&gt;, who said Borucki is “firmly in the mix” for a spot in the bullpen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-770000\" name=\"image-770000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eecd506/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4398x2468+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F33%2F755cf8754fd3817c926620e8664d%2Fap24164646106068.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f0ae714/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4398x2468+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F33%2F755cf8754fd3817c926620e8664d%2Fap24164646106068.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/be0b84a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4398x2468+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F33%2F755cf8754fd3817c926620e8664d%2Fap24164646106068.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The White Sox&amp;#x27; Drew Thorpe, pictured in 2024.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/be0b84a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4398x2468+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F33%2F755cf8754fd3817c926620e8664d%2Fap24164646106068.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/99aba12/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4398x2468+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F33%2F755cf8754fd3817c926620e8664d%2Fap24164646106068.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/be0b84a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4398x2468+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2F33%2F755cf8754fd3817c926620e8664d%2Fap24164646106068.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White Sox’ Drew Thorpe, pictured in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lindsey Wasson/AP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Road bumps’ for Drew Thorpe’s recovery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The start of camp hasn’t been as cheerful for power-throwing prospect &lt;b&gt;Drew Thorpe&lt;/b&gt;, who still hasn’t thrown off a mound as &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2025/03/22/white-sox-pitcher-drew-thorpe-to-have-tommy-john-surgery-brandon-drury-has-fractured-hand\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;he recovers from Tommy John surgery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thorpe, the centerpiece of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2024/03/13/white-sox-agree-on-trade-with-padres-for-dylan-cease\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;the &lt;/u&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dylan Cease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;u&gt; trade&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, blew out his elbow in spring training last year.
