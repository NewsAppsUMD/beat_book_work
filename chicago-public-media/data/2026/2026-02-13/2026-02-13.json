After the game, a solemn Imanaga took on his share of the blame, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have so many really good players that can perform,” Imanaga said then, through Japanese interpreter Edwin Stanberry. “And just watching that, it was amazing. And for me personally, I need to get to that level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offseason brought a series of contract option decisions, for both him and the Cubs, that briefly &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/11/04/cubs-left-hander-shota-imanaga-becomes-free-agent-after-club-and-player-options-declined\"   &gt;sent Imanaga into free agency.&lt;/a&gt; The saga ended when Imanaga &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/11/06/cubs-extend-qualifying-offers-to-shota-imanaga-and-kyle-tucker\"   &gt;agreed to the qualifying offer to return for 2026.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He'd shown what he can do at such a high level, and then just to not quite have that when we needed it the most down the stretch – he wanted more,” Hottovy said. “He thinks there’s more in there, there's more to prove. And you can tell by the way he's come into spring training that he feels that way because he's in such a great place from where he was at the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/10/06/how-shota-imanagas-throwing-philosopher-side-came-out-post-injury-nlds-brewers-game-2\"   &gt;end of the year last year&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imanaga also had to decide whether to participate in the World Baseball Classic this spring, after winning the championship with Team Japan in 2023. At winter meetings in December, national team manager Hirokazu Ibata said through an interpreter that he would be disappointed if Imanaga opted out of the tournament because of the caliber of player he is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imanaga’s circumstances, however, had changed since last WBC. He was now playing for an MLB team, which was involved in the decision-making process, and knew he needed a bounce-back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm talking to everybody around me, getting everybody's opinion,” Imanaga said Thursday. “We thought that making your own adjustments, practicing here in Arizona is probably for the best.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imanaga has been one of the Cubs’ top starters for much of his time in MLB, finishing fifth in NL Cy Young voting his rookie season and starting last season with an Opening Day nod and strong first half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs believe the hamstring strain Imanaga sustained in May impacted his execution down the stretch, through some combination of a loss of strength and/or trust in his left leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His delivery does have a lot of like depth in terms of how he gets in his back leg,” Hottovy said. “But his strength comes from holding that position and then rotating hard late. And I think he was having to [adjust] how he was rotating, which was then affecting how his arm path was. And he knew he was trying to get his arm path up a little bit and slightly higher arm release point, but he just couldn't do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming into spring, the force Imanaga is generating from that drive leg, measured by force plate technology in the Cubs’ spring training facilities, is comparable to in-game measurements before the injury, Hottovy said. That’s an improvement on his bullpens this time last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More importantly, we're just seeing very consistent mechanics right now, too,” Hottovy said, “and him not trying to search for anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imanga said he focused on his overall strength this offseason, but also \"leveling up” every other aspect of his game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Imanaga’s fastball was getting hit for home runs at a higher clip, it was often because he wasn’t getting the pitch to the top rail or the bottom of the zone. So, that will be a focal point this spring. But Hottovy also highlighted several ways Imanaga could hone and expand his arsenal, from taking another step forward with his sweeper, to reintroducing his cutter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you're chasing a specific version of you from a different year, you can go into a downward spiral,” Imanaga said, pushing back on the notion that he was trying to recapture an earlier version of himself. “So instead of focusing on what I had in the past, just try to be a better version of what I am right now.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Shah, who issued &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/News-Room/Current-News/2022%2002%2012%20TRO%20CDC%20grants.pdf?language_id=1\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;the temporary restraining order&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the Northern District Court of Illinois, said the attorneys general were “likely to succeed” in their argument because the Trump administration’s cuts were based on “arbitrary, capricious or unconstitutional” reasons, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raoul said Trump was “playing politics with critical public health funding\" by cutting millions of dollars from HIV tracking and lead poisoning prevention from California, Colorado, Illinois and Minnesota. He said the order ensures funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with other funds will continue flowing to Illinois while the case plays out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Targeting four Democrat-run states that are standing up to his completely unrelated immigration policies is a transparent attempt to bully us into compliance,” Raoul said in a statement. “We remain unflinching in our commitment to defending against the Trump administration’s continued unlawful directives intended to force us to implement immigration and other unrelated policies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, at least &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2026/02/10/trump-administration-cuts-illinois-hiv-prevention-grants\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;$29 million in Illinois grants&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are on the “hit list” being held up by the judge’s order, which include city, state and other health centers’ family planning and HIV prevention programs, according to a list of grants obtained by the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also included $7.2 million in grant cuts to the American Medical Association in Illinois, which supports gender-affirming care, as well as $5.2 million slashed from an HIV prevention program at Lurie Children’s Hospital — which recently was &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/health/2026/01/20/lurie-childrens-pauses-gender-affirming-meds-under-18\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;threatened with another federal investigation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over its gender-affirming care for youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Raoul said the cuts would force the Illinois Department of Public Health to cut nearly 100 employees, end lead poisoning prevention grants to 25 local health departments and wipe out the state’s HIV surveillance system that tracks the spread of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the latest legal win for Raoul and other attorneys general across the country suing the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Raoul was part of a large coalition of legal officials that won a suit for the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/09/24/illinois-wins-suit-on-disaster-relief-funding-held-by-dhs-over-sanctuary-laws\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;release of $2 billion in federal disaster relief funding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; held up by the White House over sanctuary city policies.

Instead, they largely shared their campaign priorities and laid bare the reasoning why they were relegated to a separate debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s telling that there are multiple aspects of our democratic process that are broken because… we only look to money as the only metric of viability. This debate is a great example,” said Democratic primary challenger Kevin Ryan, a Chicago Public Schools teacher and U.S. Marine veteran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Chicago’s Institute of Politics and International House hosted and moderated the event.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two University of Chicago students asked the candidates six questions, in topics ranging from immigration, taxes, rising cost of living and foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Democratic runners shared a general consensus on abolishing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency; raising taxes on ultra wealthy individuals and corporations; reducing the U.S. government’s military budget and reallocating that money to services like housing and health care; and ending U.S. military support for Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maxwell said the government can’t address the rising cost of living without cutting the roughly $1 trillion U.S. military budget and raising money through increased taxes on millionaires and billionaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to actually put more money back into the hands of people in this country,” said Maxwell, an agricultural engineer at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “...We’re the richest country in the world, there’s absolutely no reason people should be going without food, housing and health care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div

Botsford also noted that he agreed with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., “trying to get Americans to focus on more real foods and away from carbohydrates and sugary snacks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long said she supports Trump’s “America first” agenda and his border security. She acknowledged that while immigration enforcement “has to happen, but it needs to be done humanely.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to leading the fundraising effort, Krishnamoorthi has led most polls in the race, including a WGN-TV/Emerson College poll last month. That poll gave him 31% support over 10% for Stratton and 8% for Kelly, while 45% of poll respondents were undecided.&lt;/p&gt;",

That's a rarity in high-level Public League basketball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as the city playoffs hit the final rounds and the state playoffs loom just ten days away, Hyde Park is taking on a more prominent role in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Loyalty,” Thunderbirds senior Amare Leflore said. “We’ve developed a relationship off the court that is really going to help us in this push over the next month.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leflore scored 19 points to help Hyde Park to a 74-45 win against visiting Fenger on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/12/chicago-illinois-high-school-basketball-scores\"   &gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt; in the Public League playoffs. The win sends Hyde Park into Saturday’s quarterfinals against the winner of Crane vs. Lindblom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kye Ward-Owens, Jacobi Walls and Zyere McNeal are the other three loyal seniors. Ward-Owens scored 20 points against the Titans (13-14).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consistency has been the biggest thing for us this year, trying to get all of us to play good at one time,” Ward-Owens said. “But it is all starting to fall together now. At the perfect time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Thunderbirds (20-7) broke the game open in the third quarter, outscoring Fenger 30-12. The Titans had 28 turnovers in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our coaches really emphasize defensive pressure, and we went out there and executed,” Ward-Owens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curie is a heavy favorite to win the city championship, but Hyde Park is right there in the next tier of contenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[The city tournament] is something I’ve been looking forward to since I was a little kid,” Leflore said. “Being a senior and being able to compete for something I’ve watched most of my life is pretty exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right before the game began, the Thunderbirds learned they had earned the No. 1 seed in the Class 3A De La Salle Sectional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was a huge confidence boost,” Leflore said. “It just boosted team morale and everything.

Each site will have 12 to 20 drones, Amazon officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though delivery costs will vary, Amazon Prime members will pay $4.99 per delivery.  Shoppers might also get an option for free shipping for orders of more than  $50, said Josh Brundage, Prime Air senior manager of commercial operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers choosing drone delivery will receive an aerial satellite image of their homes with predetermined delivery points to decide where they want the package delivered. Deliveries are expected to happen in less than two hours, Brundage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drones are capable of using cameras for self navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement from Amazon comes as the expansion of other autonomous delivery devices including Coco robots and Serve robots &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/business/2026/delivery-robots-chicago-food-coco-robotics\"   &gt;has become contentious as some residents call for their removal&lt;/a&gt;. While the launch is only coming to Markham and Matteson's fulfillment centers, Brundage said the goal is to continue expanding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The south suburbs will join other autonomous drone delivery sites across the country including Texas, Florida, Michigan and Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We want to bring this everywhere we can,\" Brundage said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, \"certain geographies, or more challenging downtown areas, things like that, right now pose a challenge. But everywhere where we can provide this service, we certainly want to.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who are skeptical, Brundage said Amazon will host community events. The next one is taking place from 3 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., March 2 at the Tinley Park Convention Center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Just like any new technology, you know, sometimes people are a little leery to adopt it, but usually once they see it and once they see what it's capable of, it genuinely becomes a big deal of excitement,\" Brundage said.&lt;/p&gt;",

It seeks to reclaim the roughly $1.9 million in “misappropriated” funds through the fraudulent checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the village declined to comment further on the lawsuit, citing the ongoing litigation. A spokesperson for Fifth Third Bank also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henyard served one term as the south suburban mayor, from May 2021 to May 2025, after Mayor Jason House won in a landslide election to unseat her.

The statement also points to the shooting that wounded Marimar Martinez, who survived after being shot multiple times by a federal agent last year. It asks the state’s attorney to investigate any and “all available charges” and “use of excessive force” in the shootings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also point to the historic disproportionate use of force by law enforcement against Black residents, and said justice must be applied evenly because, “No officer and no agency is above the law.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement agenda has produced a clear and alarming pattern of violence,” the statement said. “We support thorough law enforcement investigations wherever federal agents have violated the law. We urge the Cook County State’s Attorney to act swiftly, proactively and transparently to ensure accountability and deliver justice for the families and communities who have been harmed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes just over a week after Illinois House Democrats &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://ilhousedems.com/2026/02/03/elected-officials-call-on-cook-county-states-attorney-eileen-oneil-burke-to-investigate-the-fatal-shooting-of-silverio-villegas-gonzalez-and-the-near-fatal-shooting-of-marimar-martin/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;released a similar call to action&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aimed at the state’s attorney’s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cook County State’s Attorney’s office said though Burke is “deeply concerned” about the “abhorrent behavior” of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents nationwide, her office “does not conduct independent investigations into criminal conduct and lacks jurisdiction over federal agencies, except in extremely narrow and limited circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burke said her team has drafted a protocol for how local legal systems can respond to federal agents in a way that’s “clear and grounded in law,” which the office said has been shared with local and state law enforcement, as well as other prosecutors for feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are committed to doing all we can under the law to support and review law enforcement investigations of that conduct and prosecute when appropriate,” Burke's office said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/06/eileen-oneill-burke-brandon-johnson-immigration-ice-law\"   &gt;County’s top prosecutor calls Mayor Brandon Johnson’s ICE executive order ‘wholly inappropriate’&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/02/03/mayor-brandon-johnson-executive-order-accountability-ice-agents-operation-midway-blitz-states-attorney-eileen-oneill-burke\"   &gt;Mayor Johnson defends executive order aimed at holding ICE accountable for alleged abuses&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Burke has found herself between local leaders grasping at ways to hold federal agents accountable for wounding and killing residents, federal laws that often block those actions, and President Donald Trump's administration which has blocked use of force investigations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Burke told her staff that Mayor Brandon Johnson’s recent &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/02/03/mayor-brandon-johnson-executive-order-accountability-ice-agents-operation-midway-blitz-states-attorney-eileen-oneill-burke\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;executive order&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which orders CPD to document potential crimes committed by federal agents — is inappropriate and could jeopardize criminal prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/02/03/mayor-brandon-johnson-executive-order-accountability-ice-agents-operation-midway-blitz-states-attorney-eileen-oneill-burke\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;defended the move&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and said he was trying to help Burke by providing evidence for prosecutions of federal agents, which he claimed she has spoken about publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s one of many moves state, county and local officials have taken in attempts to curb federal agents in the Chicago area, though many have faced legal uncertainty, and experts have cast doubt on one executive order Johnson signed in August that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/08/30/mayor-johnson-protecting-chicago-initiative-executive-order\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;threatened lawsuits against federal agents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, now former Cook County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Evans &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/14/top-cook-county-judge-bars-civil-arrests-at-courthouses-citing-chilling-effect\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;signed an order&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; barring civil arrests, or those without a warrant signed by a judge, at county courts, though federal officials vowed to violate it anyways.&lt;/p&gt;",

But we feel really confident that out of the group, there’s some guys that are going to hit that way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guy called on in save situations, however, will likely be one of the few returning relievers. In fact, manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell&lt;/b&gt; was surprisingly definitive when asked if right-hander &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/11/cubs-catcher-miguel-amaya-poised-for-bounce-back-after-injury-riddled-2025\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Daniel Palencia&lt;/b&gt; would get the ninth inning&lt;/a&gt; if the season began the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a sharp turn from his usual go-to answer about “out-getters.” But Counsell’s usual reluctance to define roles comes from years of experience of managing ever-changing bullpen groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Craig did a really good job in our meeting [Monday], just talking about how our bullpen evolved last year,” president of baseball operations &lt;b&gt;Jed Hoyer&lt;/b&gt; said, “and how we have all these guys in camp right now and how to focus on each guy because we don’t know how that’s going to shake out. It’s a volatile area.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoyer pointed to Palencia, who went from being left off the 2025 Opening Day roster to serving as the team’s closer for much of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using that example, we need multiple Daniel Palencias every year to step up to do things that may not have been expected,” Hoyer said. “Because especially the bullpen, there’s going to be injuries and poor performance that are going to lead to opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palencia posted a career-best 2.91 ERA in his breakout 2025 season, almost doubling his previous career high in innings with 52⅔.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Always I knew I was that guy for that situation,” Palencia said this week. “So I just tried to be ready. And last year, the lights, everything, it was awesome for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palencia made clear, however, that he was up for any role Counsell chose. He proved that in the playoffs, when he served as the “fireman,” entering in high-leverage situations no matter the inning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palencia mostly relies on his fastball, which averaged 99.6 mph last season, and splitter. But to continue elevating his game, he said he hopes to up the usage of his splitter this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hitting the ground running&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not taking any time to ease into spring training, Cubs hitters &lt;b&gt;Alex Bregman&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Michael Busch&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Pete Crow-Armstrong&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Seiya Suzuki&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Miguel Amaya &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Nico Hoerner&lt;/b&gt; all have taken live batting practice in the first two days of camp. Bregman left the complex Thursday morning, however, with an illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs signed right-hander &lt;b&gt;Kyle Wright&lt;/b&gt; to a minor-league deal, a source confirmed, and he threw a bullpen session at the complex Thursday. But the team has not yet officially announced his addition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Right-hander &lt;b&gt;Javier Assad&lt;/b&gt;, after his arrival was delayed by visa issues, was in camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Right-hander &lt;b&gt;Trent Thornton&lt;/b&gt;, who is behind in his build-up after tearing his Achilles in August, threw a bullpen session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, title=Latest on the Cubs, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, items=[{type=Image, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, anchorId=promo-630004, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/maddie-lee, name=[{items=[Maddie Lee]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[], media=[], jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Cubs reporter]}]}], title=Cubs&amp;#x27;

Graciela Guzman (D-Chicago) would codify much of the Federal Voting Rights Act into state law as insurance in case that law is repealed by Republicans in Congress. If passed, the changes to state law would take effect July 1 ahead of November's general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The last year has made one thing remarkably clear: Democracy does not run on autopilot,” she said. “It only survives if people are willing to protect it, and at the center of that responsibility is a fundamental right to vote.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill would specifically grant judges the ability to redraw racially imbalanced legislative maps and require non-English speaking voters receive translated ballots, access to bilingual poll workers, or over-the-phone non-English assistance, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legislation comes amid GOP attempts to weaken longstanding federal voting protections by requiring proof of citizenship and photo ID at the ballot box as well as attempts to invalidate mail-in-ballots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats controlled legislative map-making, which preserved the party's supermajority hold over the General Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roderick Wilson, executive director of the Bronzeville-based Lugenia Burns Hope Center, says that gerrymandering of legislative districts has come at the expense of Black and Brown representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A democracy is supposed to represent you,” Wilson said. “For people of color in America, we haven't had representation in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Federal Voting Rights Act was about protecting people...was about protecting people of color and minorities in this country,\" Wilson said. \"Instead, we have become party over race, and that has to stop.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to become law by the fall, the legislation would need to pass both chambers of the state legislature and be enacted by Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker.&lt;/p&gt;",

Hill Early Childhood Center, face aggravated criminal sexual abuse, according to court documents. They were arrested by Chicago police Feb. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendez, 51, and Flores Hernandez abused the child, who did not attend the Evanston/Skokie School District 65, “through the coordination of grooming and coercion” for nearly two years. Mendez was also alleged to have abused two other children who didn't attend the school where Mendez worked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Evanston/Skokie District 65 said Mendez has been on a leave of absence from his job as assistant principal since Oct. 28, and Flores Hernandez has been on a leave of absence of her job since Jan. 16. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It is the District’s understanding that the allegations in question are unrelated to their professional responsibilities and do not involve any District 65 students. The safety and wellbeing of our community remains our highest priority. While these allegations are deeply concerning, this is a personnel matter and we are unable to share additional details at this time,\" the district said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Cook County court hearing the day after their arrests, Flores Hernandez and Mendez were ordered detained, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In several instances between 2023 and 2025, Flores Hernandez and Mendez allegedly touched a minor inappropriately, and prosecutors added that when the girl tried to refuse their actions, Flores Hernandez would grow angry. Mendez is accused of doing sexual acts on the child in October 2025, telling the child — now 15 — to \"relax,\" according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child told her father about the sexual assault and he then called police. The child was taken to Lurie Children's Hospital for treatment, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three other children also said they were abused, officials said. Mendez and Flores Hernandez have outstanding warrants out of Florida over an alleged sexual assault incident that happened in June 2025 that involved another minor, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their next court date was scheduled for Feb. 25 at the George N. Leighton Criminal Courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "summary": "<img alt=\"EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, tapped by President Donald Trump to lead the agency last year, has accused his Democratic predecessors of being willing to &quot;bankrupt the country&quot; to combat climate change.\" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1fbfdab/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3644x2429+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F4f%2Fd0%2F469a18fe497b9335848f00b2c205%2Fap25185592525140.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday revoked a scientific finding that long has been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change, the most aggressive move by the Republican president to roll back climate regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule finalized by the Environmental Protection Agency rescinds a 2009 government declaration known as the endangerment finding that determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare. The Obama-era finding is the legal underpinning of nearly all climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The repeal eliminates all greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and trucks and could unleash a broader undoing of climate regulations on stationary sources such as power plants and oil and gas facilities, experts say. Legal challenges are near certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump called the move “the single largest deregulatory action in American history, by far,” while EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the endangerment finding “the Holy Grail of federal regulatory overreach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top Illinois Democrats, including U.S. Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, joined 47 other Senate Democrats last September to oppose the Trump administration’s effort to roll back the foundational climate rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This disastrous decision reverses decades of progress and ignores decades of legal and scientific precedent, and its negative impacts won’t just be felt immediately, but for generations to come as well,” the U.S. Senate Environmental Justice Caucus, which Duckworth co-chairs, said in a statement. “It’s yet another Trump-created disaster for American families, all to line his billionaire donors’ pocketbooks, as Americans pay the price.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sierra Club filed the original lawsuit that established the scientific finding more than 20 years ago. Jack Darin, director of the Illinois chapter of the environmental advocacy organization, said that state action is more relevant than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Illinois must continue to lead the way,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump called the endangerment finding “one of the greatest scams in history,” claiming falsely that it “had no basis in fact” or law. “On the contrary, over the generations, fossil fuels have saved millions of lives and lifted billions of people out of poverty all over the world,” Trump said at a White House ceremony, although scientists across the globe agree that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are driving catastrophic heat waves and storms, droughts and sea level rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental groups described the move as the single biggest attack in U.S. history against federal authority to address climate change. Evidence backing up the endangerment finding has only grown stronger in the 17 years since it was approved, they said.&lt;br&gt;“This action will only lead to more climate pollution, and that will lead to higher costs and real harms for American families,” said Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense Fund, adding that the consequences would be felt on Americans’ health, property values, water supply and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Matthew Daly is an Associated Press writer.
