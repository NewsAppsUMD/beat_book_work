      "summary": "<img alt=\"Nazareth's Mia Gage (4) drives toward the basket as the Roadrunners go on to win the class 4A sectional championship at Hinsdale Central, February 26, 2026, Hinsdale, Illinois. | \" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/95f86cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1200+0+0/resize/840x504!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2Fe6%2F6c68b4dd44888ce69f8567b43ef5%2Fkw-cst-022726-7003.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;As Nazareth celebrated after knocking off Downers Grove North 53-26 on Thursday in Hinsdale to win the 4A sectional championship, its players wandered around the floor, taking turns getting pictures with the championship plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many of the players, this is old hat as Nazareth is a perennial power. But for freshman Mia Gage, this is her first go-around. When it was her time to clutch that coveted championship, Nazareth fans serenaded her by yelling “Truth!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s amazing,” Gage said of hearing the chants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gage scored 12 points on 6-for-9 shooting with five rebounds and three steals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She has no fear,” said senior forward Stella Sakalas, who totaled 15 points, 11 rebounds and five assists. “Which is exactly what this team needs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter, Gage made two correct reads to pick off passes and take them the other way for easy baskets. Gage, at 6-0, is very athletic and disruptive in passing lanes. She is a rugged and willing rebounder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nazareth (32-3) exploded out of the gate, suffocating the Trojans’ offense and holding them to just four points from senior forward Adysen Fanta in the first quarter. The Roadrunners set the tone on the defense and never relented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were locked in all week,” coach Ed Stritzel said. “They knew that Downers had some shooters, and I thought our defense was just spectacular.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roadrunners held Downers Grove North (30-3) to just seven baskets for the game and scored 23 points off their turnovers. Nazareth also thrived in transition with 24 fast-break points. When Nazareth can score off miscues, its a tough team to beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We talk really well on defense, and it helps so much,” Gage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not always easy being a freshman trying to navigate varsity basketball, particularly against Nazareth’s challenging schedule, but Gage has shown she’s up for the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve learned to play my role well, and we’ve all just played as a team,” Gage said. “And as the games have gone on, we’ve just played so much better together, and I think that’s showing at the right time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior guard Sophia Towne scored 10 points, and senior guard Lyla Shelton added 11. Towne and Sakalas, a BYU commit, are two of the best players in their respective grades, but the Roadrunners are a well-rounded group with multiple threats on the court. Gage’s development throughout the season gives Nazareth another threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Gage] doesn’t play like a freshman,” Stritzel said. “She’s only going to get better and better. She’s a raw talent, and she wants to be great. She’s so long on that wing, and our guards put so much pressure on the ball, and then Mia and Stella played a passing lane . . . it’s a tough defense to play against.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Nazareth celebrated on the court, most of the players knew that there was still work to be done. They still have to win the supersectional game against Waubonsie Valley on Monday to advance in the IHSA state tournament. The Roadrunners haven’t lost since Dec. 30 — to an out-of-state team — and their last loss to an in-state opponent was Dec. 13 against Benet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been preparing for a long time, and we’re just thinking about winning seven games one time [to win the state championship],” Sakalas said. ‘‘[This was] just a team win. We played unselfish basketball, and that’s just what we want.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Heck, the Bulls coach doesn’t even feel the need to grab a sign that reads “Slow Down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His offense can’t afford to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too undersized, too inexperienced in playing with each other, and frankly just not good enough to be a lethal team in half-court sets. So while it would be easier on Donovan if his new-look roster was a bit better conditioned, he’s doing all he can to try and get them there – one mile per hour quicker at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One is you have to look at are they capable of playing that way?” Donovan said, when discussing the need to keep his offensive philosophy intact. “Now, are they conditioned for that? We’re trying to obviously get that done. The other point is if we don’t try and play in transition and play fast, we don’t have enough cohesiveness and chemistry to be this team where, ‘We’re going to out-execute you in the halfcourt.’ “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all the traded pieces that most disrupted what Donovan liked to do on the offensive end, center Nikola Vucevic’s role has been the hardest to try and replicate. Not only because of his skillset as a versatile big, but his IQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of what we did, and the biggest adjustment has been not having Vooch here,” Donovan said. “He was such a facilitator and a pocket player, a guy that can score at different levels, you ran offense through him. That’s taken away some of the package. If we try and play in the halfcourt, one, we don’t have enough (practice) time to work on that execution, and two, the way the league is going you want to play a little faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as the legs hold up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Donovan thinks the likes of Collin Sexton, Rob Dillingham and Anfernee Simons have the ability to play up-tempo basketball, their conditioning says otherwise. What the coach wants to avoid is more injuries than the Bulls already have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s been difficult for me is as much as you want to practice, you have guys coming into here that are playing more minutes now than they did at their prior teams,” Donovan added. “There is a concern medically that we’ve got to be careful that if these guys get ramped up so many minutes that these guys end up going out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Size matters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls’ frontcourt continued to thin out with Patrick Williams now in street clothes with a quad strain. The forward suffered the injury in the loss to Charlotte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His will probably be at least a week,” Donovan said of Williams’ timetable. “It could be longer, although I think they would try and ramp him up and do some more in about a week (after they) can get it to calm down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forward/center Jalen Smith remained sidelined with a calf issue and like Williams was at least a week away from starting to get reconditioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves undersized 6-foot-7 Guerschon Yabusele as the starting center for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Closer look&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Donovan is still figuring out exact roles and combinations for the roster, one player he has already tabbed as having a chance to be an improved defender down this final stretch is Sexton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That hasn’t been the guard’s reputation throughout his career, but Donovan said he felt the skill to do that was there.&lt;/p&gt;",

They were taken No. 1 and 2 overall in the 2015 MLB Draft. They debuted the next year and appeared in that All-Star Futures Game. They played against each other in the 2021 World Series, when Swanson’s Braves beat Bregman’s Astros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before all that, however, they were teammates on the 2014 USA Baseball collegiate national team, setting up a sweet reunion when Bregman signed a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/01/10/cubs-alex-bregman-agree-to-5-year-175-million-deal\"   &gt;five-year deal worth $175 million&lt;/a&gt;  with the Cubs this offseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had so much fun that summer,” Bregman said of that 2014 team. “It's one of those memories in the game that you'll never forget, of going out and competing for your country. So if you asked him, too, we both look super fondly back on that time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both playing SEC baseball, Bregman was LSU’s shortstop, and Swanson was at second base for Vanderbilt that year. They became a double play tandem for the United States’ college squad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's great playing up the middle with somebody who's just a superstar,” Bregman said of Swanson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That team traveled to North Carolina, the Netherlands and Cuba for five different events, playing teams that had traveled from all over the world, including Japan and Chinese Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was my first time playing baseball against different countries and cultures, really,” Swanson said. “So to be able to have that experience was pretty unique and special.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the years went on, Swanson and Bregman kept in touch periodically. They always had “competitive respect for one another,” as Swanson put it. But there wasn’t an opening for them to play together again until last spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman’s free agency was dragging on longer than expected. And the Cubs’ third base situation was murky after they included &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2024/12/13/kyle-tucker-trade-cubs-astros\"   &gt;Isaac Paredes in the trade with Houston for right fielder Kyle Tucker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When certain guys are obvious fits for what we want to be, it's not too hard to lobby,” Swanson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swanson’s lobbying fell in line with president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer’s thinking. But &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/02/12/what-alex-bregman-reportedly-signing-with-red-sox-means-for-cubs\"   &gt;Hoyer’s attempt to sign Bregman&lt;/a&gt;, even after convincing ownership to expand the offseason budget, fell short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bregman opted out of his Red Sox contract to hit free agency again this past winter, the Cubs made sure they didn’t whiff again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was pretty cool to share the infield with him [in 2014],” Bregman said. “Now we get to do it again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, both obsessed with winning, they’re intent on pushing this Cubs team deep into the playoffs. And now, a dozen years later, they’re far more polished versions of the players who led the collegiate national team to a 18-8-2 record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think he's someone that is going to be really good for me, just being able to ping thoughts and ideas off of,” Swanson said. “And someone that can help understand me, and me understand him. And us having that dialog with one another is going to be really helpful for, I think, both of us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, title=Latest on the Cubs, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, items=[{type=Image, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb/2026/02/26/mlb-umpire-bruce-froemming-who-called-milt-pappas-no-hitter-for-the-cubs-dies-at-age-86, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, timestamp=1772154485000, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb, isFeatured=false, category=[{items=[MLB]}], authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/associated-press, name=[{items=[AP]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, jobTitle=[], _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[{items=[The Associated Press is an independent, not-for-profit news cooperative headquartered in New York City.

Arichely is one of about 545 students who attend two high schools run by the financially-distressed Aspira Charter School Network. More than 90% of students at the two schools are Latino, more than two-thirds are low income and more than half are English Language Learners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of back-and-forth, Chicago Public Schools officials are telling students that the network does not have the money to make it through the school year and that they should transfer before the start of the last quarter “to safeguard their education stability.\" While there’s debate about whether it is CPS’ fault or Aspira’s, such a mid-year school closing is virtually unheard of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely, like other students, has a long list of concerns and questions about credits, grades, senior events and graduation. But she also has a more emotional worry. She lives far from her current school, Aspira Business and Finance Academy in Avondale, and, if she’s sent to her neighborhood school, she doesn’t think many of her friends will go there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She describes herself as shy and wonders what it will be like to walk into a new school three-quarters of the way into the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think my biggest issue is that I'm going to have to reintroduce myself to people that I don't know,” she said. “Now I'm gonna be all alone, and I'm not gonna have the people that I'm used to having.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-520000\" name=\"image-520000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de9ca2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+50/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fdc%2Febd3caf449508a44aa54b742e089%2Faspiraclosing-260227-16.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9cff274/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+50/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fdc%2Febd3caf449508a44aa54b742e089%2Faspiraclosing-260227-16.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff9e03c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+50/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fdc%2Febd3caf449508a44aa54b742e089%2Faspiraclosing-260227-16.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A poster of future events in jeopardy hangs on the door of Jose Torres’ classroom at ASPIRA Business &amp;amp; Finance High School, located at 2989 N.

At the Chicago Board of Education meeting Thursday, CPS officials addressed the students before explaining their decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not the outcome that anyone hoped for,” said Zabrina Evans, CPS executive director of Innovation and Incubation. “We understand the stress and difficulty of today's news. We understand the uncertainty and disruption that comes with changing schools in the middle of the current school year.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans then explained that getting to this point has been “long and complicated,” but that essentially Aspira, like all charter organizations, agreed to operate a school with the money provided by CPS and that Aspira has not been able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CPS provides funding and support, and charter operators deliver educational services to students,” she said. Not only has Aspira been unable to prove to the district that it can provide those educational services through June, but the charter operator has failed to turn over an audit and other required financial documents, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also noted that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2025/11/25/cps-to-help-aspira-make-payroll-but-charter-operators-financial-woes-remain\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;CPS has given Aspira $2.25 million in cash advances&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and yet the network still says it needs millions more to pay teachers and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS is “moving forward with this student transition process… due to the dire situation created by the failure of Aspira to demonstrate financial stability, which places the education of Aspira students at risk,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until Wednesday night, Aspira Chief Executive Director Edgar Lopez seemed hopeful that he could save the schools. He told CPS that he was meeting with a bank to get a bridge loan and looking at fundraising, even a crowdfunding campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But speaking at the board meeting, Lopez blamed CPS for the charter schools’ financial problems. He said charters get 83% of what district-run CPS schools receive, though school district officials refute that figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like charters are stepchildren to CPS,” he said. “Our families pay taxes just like all the rest of the families pay taxes. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lopez has also accused CPS of undermining charter schools through its high school application process by prioritizing sending students to district-run schools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-960000\" name=\"image-960000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7e0a4fd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/67074ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c0354c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A man wearing glasses and a yellow button-up shirt stands in a classroom.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c0354c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d902c3e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c0354c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspira’s executive director, Edgar Lopez, spoke with students at Aspira Business &amp;amp; Finance High School on Wednesday.

This year Aspira’s high schools started out with less than 600 students, some 200 less than five years ago. Charter school operators also cite other issues that have added to their financial troubles, including rising labor costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lopez told the board no “irregularities” will be found in Aspira’s finances and that it has had clean audits, but the one for last year is not yet complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pleaded with the board to keep the school intact, even if they remove Aspira management, at least until the end of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If this is for the kids, then worry about the kids,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘We should be celebrating our future’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely and dozens of other students and teachers attended Thursday’s meeting. Some of them assigned blame to Aspira and Lopez, while others said CPS is responsible and should do more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more than anything, they lamented the fact that they were caught in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Walsh, who teaches math at the Business and Finance Academy, cited a study that showed students are more likely to drop out of school, face violence and suffer from depression after a mid-year school closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said teachers like him will figure out how to make it through, but they are worried about the students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need assurances that the students will be looked after and they will face as little fracture as possible,” he said. “CPS needs to give them the dignity of an actionable plan that does not repeat history. This is your responsibility, unless you are resigned to make them another statistic.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students expressed frustration, but they also wanted to know what was going to happen next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Lavelle Turner said he was looking forward to his last season playing on the Aspira baseball team and getting ready to take tests to see if he could get college credit for advanced placement classes. He wanted to know whether he would even be able to play baseball and complete his AP classes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should not have to pay and sacrifice our future,” he said. “We should be celebrating our future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d80000\" name=\"image-d80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bc43a45/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f916013/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70fff7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Aspira Charter School students speak during a school board meeting at Chicago Public Schools in Chicago on Thursday, Feb. 26, 2026. | Talia Sprague/for the Sun-Times\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70fff7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9de36e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70fff7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspira Charter School students speak during a school board meeting Thursday at Chicago Public Schools in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talia Sprague/Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely is on track to go to Loyola University. But now she is wondering if she will graduate on time and whether the transition will affect her ability to get scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How would a teacher that doesn't really know who we are write a recommendation letter,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely and other seniors said they were dismayed by the idea that they won’t get to go to senior luncheon, Six Flags and prom with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely said she’s built a large group of friends and she looked forward to having fun with them, but if they aren’t at these events, she won’t go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think I'd feel a bit left out because I don't know anyone, and then I wouldn't feel comfortable going to a place or … participating in an activity without my friends,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Emilo Zurita said he is concerned that some students won’t even go to a new school, at least for the rest of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've heard them say if Aspira closes, they feel like dropping out because they don't feel safe in another school,” he said. “They'd rather drop out than be in a school where they could get shot or something could happen to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A warning for other charter schools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conrad Timbers-Ausar, CPS’ acting chief portfolio officer, said he is working on a transition plan including a list of high schools near Aspira that will guarantee a seat to the displaced students. He said these schools will have a designated transition coordinator who will do check-ins with students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also will be provided “wraparound services tailored to students needs including mentoring, tutoring, mental health services and more,” he told board members. “They will also be prepared to provide additional items like technology, uniforms and school gear that students may need to be successful in the school. Students will receive CPS bus cards to get safely to and from school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district will make sure that credits transfer and that students are able to complete classes, he said. Students will be given a letter to send to colleges explaining the transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Zaccor, a school board member who represents the North Side, said she wants to make sure students can play on spring sports teams. She also instructed CPS officials to look into arranging senior events, like prom and graduation, exclusively for Aspira students, even if they are no longer together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we need to think outside the box and make sure that those things happen,” she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debby Pope, who represents a different North Side district, called the situation a “terrible experience” and “unfair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she said she hopes this sends a warning to other charters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to behave responsibly,” she said. “You have to have your finances in order. You have to be transparent. You have to turn in your audits. We cannot do this to our children. It is just not okay.”&lt;/p&gt;",

The shop is scheduled to close Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no new owner on deck to take over Pride Cleaners, 558 E. 79th St., meaning there will be one less place for South Siders to get their clothes dry cleaned and tailored. And the closure also creates an uncertain future for one of Chicago's most unique modernist sites: an absolute showstopper of a building with its original sign — neither of which are under city landmark protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We are on the verge of losing [an unofficial] historical landmark,\" Ald. William Hall (6th) said. \"An economic engine, of sorts. And also on the verge of losing a part of our history.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built in 1959, Pride Cleaners was designed by Chicago architect Gerald Siegwart. The space race and postwar modernism were shaping nearly every element of U.S. design then, from tailfins rising from the rear decks of automobiles to the shape of household furnishings and, of course, architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Pride, Siegwart designed a building with a self-supporting hyperbolic paraboloid concrete roof that created an interior free of columns. Chicago largely is a flat-topped city, but Siegwart's roof starts at ground level at two anchor points then shoots heavenward at a radical angle. The design choice gives the cleaners building a base that is almost entirely glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there's the finishing touch: a parking lot sign that features the cleaner's name on electrified, lozenge-shape letters done-up in Pop Art colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building and its electric sign — winking and blinking in all its glory — can been seen in the 2001 film \"Ali.\" Will Smith, portraying the boxer, is driving past the cleaners when passersby tell him Malcolm X has been killed. And the cleaners exterior and sign appear in Chance the Rapper's 2025 music video for the tune \"Ride.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Very few commercial neighborhood buildings in our city capture that mid-century spirit and commands one's attention like Pride Cleaners,\" Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller said. \"The building is reminiscent of futuristic &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/googie-architecture-of-the-space-age-122837470/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Googie architecture&lt;/a&gt;, often seen in cities like Los Angeles but with few surviving examples in Chicago.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pride customer Freddie Macklin, who learned of the cleaners' closing when he visited Thursday, said, \"The building is alright to me.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pride's manager, who asked not to be named, said the new owners — out-of-towners who bought the business last year — told her two weeks ago the Chatham mainstay would be closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"How can you leave something like this?\" she said. \"Just leave it and abandon it.

If he walks away, who knows what's going to happen with it?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ehman said he will try to find a new owner for Pride. It might also be a good time for the city's Department of Planning and Development to wade in and help find new owners and seek landmarks status for this very special building and sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall said he wants to see the building reused before a landmark designation is pursued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I'd like to see another cleaners there,\" he said. \"You know, what good is a relic without revenue.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

The Sox might not see him again till the last days of spring training, depending on how the defending champions fare in the WBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami was slated to play first base in a Cactus League game against the Dodgers on Thursday before leaving to join teammates in advance of their March 6 WBC opener against Chinese Taipei, but he was scratched in the morning because of general soreness in what the Sox said was a “precautionary” move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”He was a full participant in our camp just ahead of a long flight [Friday] morning,” manager Will Venable said. “I thought it was in his best interest not to play today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami, who signed a two-year, $34 million deal in December, agreed. He took on a heavier workload than most Sox teammates in preparation for the WBC. Fatigue was setting in, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was ramping up at a very high speed,” he said Thursday, citing a tight schedule and daily work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was aggressive,” Venable said. “It’s really important we don’t ask him to do too much here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In four Cactus League games, Murakami was 5-for-13 with two doubles and five strikeouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no long balls in Arizona’s thin air for Murakami, who walloped 246 home runs in eight seasons in Japan, including 56 in 2022. He could get a hero’s welcome in his homeland. In the last WBC in 2023, Murakami swatted a walk-off double against Mexico in the semifinals and a home run against the United States in the championship game in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wants another title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to go into every single game to win it, and that’s my fullest goal,” Murakami said. “Go into the batter’s box with every intention of winning it every single game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venable said he’ll root for his new player, “even when he’s playing Team USA. Maybe not Team Japan as much. Just excited to see him do his thing and be tuned in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As first impressions go, Murakami hit one out of the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just loved the person,” Venable said. “His ability to be part of the group, this young group, his personality has been amazing. What really stuck out is we asked him to do things in his training and preparation that are different than what he’s done in the past. For someone [who has such conviction] in his preparation and who takes it so seriously, to be that adjustable has been cool to see. Excited about getting him back in the White Sox uniform again with the season starting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortstop Colson Montgomery said Murakami’s English improved just in recent weeks. He has enjoyed random chats about non-baseball things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had good conversations without his translator, and that shows a lot about him, that he’s willing to learn English a lot for the betterment of the team, for us being able to communicate with him, too,” Montgomery said. “He’s teaching us some words. He’s good. He’s a great addition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dodgers 7, Sox 6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left-hander &lt;b&gt;Sean Newcomb&lt;/b&gt;, who signed a one-year, $4.5 million free-agent deal, started and allowed two runs and four hits in two innings. He’s being stretched out as a starter but could pitch in a variety of relief roles, as well. Newcomb struck out two, including former Cub &lt;b&gt;Kyle Tucker &lt;/b&gt;to end the second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Second-year catcher &lt;b&gt;Kyle Teel &lt;/b&gt;made an impression. “He’s a real competitor back there; you can see it in his eyes,” Newcomb said. “He’s got bull horns kind of coming at you. He came out with the third hitter. I expected a how-you-feeling type of thing, and he was like, ‘Get in your legs! Let’s go!’ That kind of fired me up. Looking forward to working with him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Shortstop &lt;b&gt;Tanner Murray&lt;/b&gt;, trying to win a job in a utility role, hit his second home run in four games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;b&gt;On deck: &lt;/b&gt;Rangers at Sox, 2:05 p.m. Friday, Glendale, 1000-AM, &lt;b&gt;MacKenzie Gore &lt;/b&gt;vs.&lt;b&gt; Erick Fedde&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Sox at Brewers, 2:10 p.m.

Or consistently making the routine play and occasionally charging in or ranging up the middle to make an exceptional one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people in this clubhouse can have that leadership role,” Montgomery, who turns 24 Friday, said, “but you want to lead by example.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s what manager Will Venable is telling his players. Get out of the batter’s box hard, play hard, don’t take a pitch off or give up an at-bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And that’s all you can do,” Montgomery said. “And if that's a leadership role, a lot of us have that. That’s what everyone wants to do in here. Play as hard as they can, and the best they can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to recovering from a hitting funk to post an .840 OPS with after he was called up from Triple-A Charlotte for his debut on the Fourth of July, the 6-4 Montgomery, a high school first-round draft pick in 2021, seemed to put questions about whether he belonged at shortstop to rest, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like my defensive confidence is at an all-time high,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to his first step in the field, he attributes his steady defensive play to the focus and intent he alluded to talking about leadership. That starts with his pre-pitch setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because when I’m on time with that and I have the intent and mindset of the ball is being hit to me every single time, it keeps me more locked in and engaged every single play,” Montgomery said. “And makes me feel like I have better range, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery was ill and sidelined two days this week but quickly got back into the swing of things when he homered on a 3-0 pitch from the Reds’ Lyon Richardson on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After dealing with the disappointment of getting sent out of major league camp  last season, he finds himself entrenched as one of the rebuilding Sox’ higher-profile guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been on two different ends of it,” he said. “The end where you come in and you try to make the team and you feel like you’ve got all the world, the pressure on you and you come in and you have a lot less pressure to come in and do what you need to do to get yourself ready to play every day. I just feel like this year, in spring, I have a better understanding of what I have to do at the plate and even defensively. Not just in the game, but in my work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery’s offseason work has been apparent to Venable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He came into camp in great shape, really athletic,” Venable said Thursday. “He’s a high-performing athlete, it’s always nice to see those guys lean into that in their offseason work. He did that. It showed up on the field [Wednesday] with some of those plays, coming in. He looks great.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chatter at SoxFest Live suggested 40 homers in his sophomore season based on what he did in three months as a rookie, well-regarded statistical projection systems like ZiPS and Steamer have Montgomery under 25 homers and 130 games played, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery will keep his own projections to himself. In any case, it was good to put the first home run in camp on the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It just shows that if I’m committed to my plan, and committed in not trying to cheat to fastballs or try to do too much, that if I just can touch the ball, I can do damage,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListL\" data-module  data-hide-authors=\"true\"

He was 86.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froemming fell just after midnight Tuesday and hit his head on the hardwood floor at his home in Mequon, Wisconsin, and was taken to Ascension Columbia St. Mary's Hospital in Milwaukee, according to Froemming's son, Steven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had brain bleeding that medical personnel could not stop because Froemming was on blood thinners, leading to his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froemming was a semipro baseball player and started his umpiring career in the minor leagues in 1958 at age 18. He worked his way up and joined the National League staff in 1971. He shifted to the unified major league staff in 2000 and retired in 2007 having worked 5,163 games, second at the time to Bill Klem's 5,373. They were both surpassed by Joe West, who worked 5,460 games before retiring in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froemming started his umpiring career at a minor league game in Waterloo, Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I thought I was in heaven — on the ballfield, professional athletes, I was starting my professional career,\" he told The Associated Press days before his retirement. \"But never did you dream at the time, ever even think of going to a big league ballpark, because you had so far to go through the minor leagues to even get a chance.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He concluded that being a good umpire required \"probably being patient with yourself. ... You're going to make mistakes early on.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the most famous of the no-hitters he worked was on Sept. 2, 1972. Milt Pappas of the Cubs retired his first 26 batters and went to a 1-2 count on pinch-hitter Larry Stahl before walking him. Pappas then retired Garry Jestadt on a popup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froemming was behind the plate for three other no-hitters, by Ed Halicki (1975), Nolan Ryan (1981) and José Jiménez (1999). He worked five World Series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he retired, Froemming became a special assistant to MLB's vice president on umpiring,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is survived by his wife, the former Rosemarie Loch, whom he married in 1957; two sons, Steven and Kevin; sister Cathy Seizer; half-brother Johnny Froemming; and two grandchildren.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

who was accompanied by Father Michael Pfleger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We pray for his children and grandchildren,” Cardinal Cupich said from the pulpit. “Let them know that they follow in the footsteps of a man who was a giant for justice. And, in that way, his word will continue to live on well beyond his years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know there's a big hole in their hearts at this moment, and I just wanted to stand in solidarity with them,” Cupich told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That line of his to ‘keep hope alive’ was so important because he understood that hope is different than optimism,” Cupich said. “Optimism is about tomorrow. Hope is about today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside, scores of people waited along Drexel Avenue in the crisp but sunny weather as recordings of Jackson’s speeches blared from speakers. Many chanted “I am somebody” and “keep hope alive,” the signature rallying cries of the late reverend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-dd0000\" name=\"image-dd0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9692965/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/59bc46a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b89516b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"JJREPOSETHURS_260227-18.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b89516b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2c9a7b4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b89516b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flanked by family members, the Rev.

He had a very humorous side, but it was easy to talk with him,” said Holland, 68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recalled Jackson urging parents to “teach your children how to think.” It was a lesson she said she carried with her into motherhood, passing it down from her children to her grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will never forget that,” Holland said. “I know that I’ll remember that I am somebody.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-af0000\" name=\"image-af0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/549628b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0000883/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9898ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"DW0A0787.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9898ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a125a5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9898ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen Holland (left) and Julius Owens were CVS classmates when the Rev.

But she said she will never forget his efforts to fight for human rights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Edwards, 75, said Jackson motivated her as a young girl to go to college, becoming the first person in her family to receive a college degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He taught us that education was the road to success,”  Edwards said. Jackson not only encouraged her to pursue her own education, but also inspired her to lead by example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He said ‘once you get there, don’t forget to look back and bring somebody with you,’” Edwards added. “And that was always our motto, to help somebody along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘We’ve lost a voice’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pastor King James Camper, 60, of Richton Park, said Jackson’s path led him to go into ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He wasn’t traditional,” said Camper, who leads Camper’s Temple Church of God in Christ, in Gary, Indiana. “He was connected to the community and the people, and he connected religion with current events. It’s more than just seeking God but learning to live in this society and fight for rights with God’s help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the eldest attendees was Henry Jones, 93, a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, which Jackson joined in 1960. He said he was “humbled” and at a loss for words as he viewed Jackson and considered his life’s accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve lost a voice, we’ve lost a soldier,” Jones said. “We’ve lost someone who was always on the forefront.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f90000\" name=\"image-f90000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c7ad3cf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6b61b0c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c00782/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mayor Brandon Johnson hugs a supporter outside the Rainbow PUSH Coalition\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c00782/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f58eb21/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c00782/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayor Brandon Johnson hugs a supporter outside the Rainbow PUSH Coalition as hundreds of mourners pay their respects to Rev.

Privately, his peers say he's even more competitive than he lets on publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while Bedard would never admit it, weeks of watching Team Canada’s Olympic run — which fell just short — while he sat around idly surely lit a fire underneath him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fire was obvious Thursday. In fact, it resembled a blazing inferno. On a night when many of his Hawks teammates looked rusty in a 4-2 loss to the Predators, Bedard singlehandedly generated the majority of his team’s offense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He ripped his 24th goal off a savvy pass from &lt;b&gt;Ryan Greene&lt;/b&gt; in the second period, broke in alone on Predators goalie &lt;b&gt;Justus Annunen&lt;/b&gt; a full three additional times and hunted down loose pucks aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen of the Hawks’ 27 scoring chances occurred with Bedard on the ice. He also took faceoffs for the first time since his Dec. 12 shoulder injury, winning seven of 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the Connor we’ve seen lots of,” coach &lt;b&gt;Jeff Blashill&lt;/b&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;CONNOR BEDARD WITH A WICKED SHOT 🏒 &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/5GyHI1cSdy\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5GyHI1cSdy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; NHL (@NHL) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/NHL/status/2027205208346927410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 27, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Hawks let a 2-1 lead in the third period slip away. Predators veteran &lt;b&gt;Ryan O’Reilly &lt;/b&gt;outsmarted Hawks rookie &lt;b&gt;Sam Rinzel&lt;/b&gt; to tip in the game-winning goal with 3:15 left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bedard, striking his usual public humble tone, praised Greene and &lt;b&gt;Andre Burakovsky&lt;/b&gt; for setting him up for “five or six Grade A” chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s on me to put one more of those in and maybe it’s a different game,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;QB search&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears have found their franchise quarterback in &lt;b&gt;Caleb Williams&lt;/b&gt;, but the Hawks are still searching for their quarterback on the power play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They spread out reps between Rinzel, &lt;b&gt;Artyom Levshunov&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt; Kevin Korchinski&lt;/b&gt; and veteran &lt;b&gt;Matt Grzelcyk&lt;/b&gt; during the past week of practices. Although Rinzel quarterbacked the top unit Thursday, that job is very much available to claim during the stretch run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got [defensemen] that have shown they’re capable of being power-play guys,” Blashill said. “We’d like to see one or two guys grab it and show they’re elite at it. There’s a difference there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levshunov &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/01/30/blackhawks-artyom-levshunov-reset-break-foundational-skills-jeff-blashill\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;returned to the lineup&lt;/a&gt; Thursday and quarterbacked the second unit.

They worked on an entry with two drop passes and another entry with zero, where the initial puck-carrier sneaks into the zone on his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both new entries were on display during a successful third-period power play. A zero-drop entry by &lt;b&gt;Frank Nazar&lt;/b&gt; created one extended zone sequence. A minute later, a two-drop entry back to Bedard created another extended sequence culminating in a &lt;b&gt;Tyler Bertuzzi&lt;/b&gt; goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I like that [two-drop entry] where I can get that much speed and come in,” Bedard said. “I feel pretty confident about it when I have those gaps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Extra attacker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks haven’t practiced six-on-five situations (with the goalie pulled) much this season, but they finally did Monday. They converted a couple times in practice, so it’ll be interesting to see if that makes a difference down the stretch. They’re the only NHL team with zero goals in those situations. They came up empty again Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only one&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defenseman &lt;b&gt;Wyatt Kaiser&lt;/b&gt; is the Hawks’ lone injured player. He has resumed skating individually as he works his way back from a Feb. 4 knee injury and could return to action next week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The Bulls hold Portland’s lottery-protected first-round pick, but only if the Blazers make the playoffs. Otherwise, it carries over for another year through 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the red corner was the coach from Rockville Centre, New York, who continues spending long nights in the office trying to figure out how he can help will this mishmash of a roster to a victory. Billy Donovan doesn’t know any other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something had to give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 11th consecutive time, it was Donovan and the roster he has been given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of another high-turnover game — 20 in this one — the Bulls (24-36) stumbled to the worst month in franchise history with an 0-11 February, losing 121-112.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls got 20 points from Matas Buzelis, but even he wasn’t great on a 6-for-16 shooting night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that Karnisovas &amp;amp; Co. should have minded much. Portland’s win kept the Blazers in the No. 9 spot for the play-in, still trying to close in on the No. 8 Warriors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while Donovan wasn’t looking to offer a helping hand in that, he also wasn’t oblivious to the entire situation, especially with the prospect of adding a second first-round pick in a loaded class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The discussions I had with them when the trade deadline was finalized was, ‘Nothing has changed, try and get these guys to play to the best of their ability; we know it’s going to be somewhat challenging with seven new players,’ ’’ Donovan said. “Even talking to ownership, it’s been, ‘Hey, go out there and do your very best.’ There has been no indication from ownership or the front office of, ‘Hey, listen, if we finish here, here or here’ or ‘Listen, don’t worry about playing these guys; just play these guys.’ There’s been none of that at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Philosophically, I get the dynamics once June, whatever date that draft date is, I get how that impacts all of that. It’s not like I’m sitting over there saying, ‘Well, it’s a close game right now, let’s sit Josh [Giddey] and Tre [Jones] and Jalen [Smith].’ There has not been that. And I think if I did do that, they would say, ‘Listen, you need to put the best guys out there.’ ’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a nice idea for Donovan to hold on to, but with the pressure the front office is starting to feel, it’s not in its best interests to play the “best guys” at this point. It made sure of that by trading some of the team’s better guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Donovan needed a reminder of that, it came in the last minutes after a dunk by Leonard Miller cut the deficit to three with 3:37 left. Rather than build off that and continue the rally, the Bulls’ defense fell apart. Donovan’s squad was outscored 13-7 to close the game out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the third-longest losing streak in franchise history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not making excuses; we don’t think we’re 11-game-losing-streak bad,” forward Isaac Okoro said. “At this point, we just have to come to the game focused and do the little things right. Blocking out, not turning the ball over, not letting them get second-chance points. Just doing the little things, and we can win games.”&lt;/p&gt;",
