      "summary": "<img alt=\"Nazareth's Mia Gage (4) drives toward the basket as the Roadrunners go on to win the class 4A sectional championship at Hinsdale Central, February 26, 2026, Hinsdale, Illinois. | \" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/95f86cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1200+0+0/resize/840x504!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2Fe6%2F6c68b4dd44888ce69f8567b43ef5%2Fkw-cst-022726-7003.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;As Nazareth celebrated after knocking off Downers Grove North 53-26 on Thursday in Hinsdale to win the 4A sectional championship, its players wandered around the floor, taking turns getting pictures with the championship plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many of the players, this is old hat as Nazareth is a perennial power. But for freshman Mia Gage, this is her first go-around. When it was her time to clutch that coveted championship, Nazareth fans serenaded her by yelling “Truth!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s amazing,” Gage said of hearing the chants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gage scored 12 points on 6-for-9 shooting with five rebounds and three steals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She has no fear,” said senior forward Stella Sakalas, who totaled 15 points, 11 rebounds and five assists. “Which is exactly what this team needs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter, Gage made two correct reads to pick off passes and take them the other way for easy baskets. Gage, at 6-0, is very athletic and disruptive in passing lanes. She is a rugged and willing rebounder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nazareth (32-3) exploded out of the gate, suffocating the Trojans’ offense and holding them to just four points from senior forward Adysen Fanta in the first quarter. The Roadrunners set the tone on the defense and never relented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were locked in all week,” coach Ed Stritzel said. “They knew that Downers had some shooters, and I thought our defense was just spectacular.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roadrunners held Downers Grove North (30-3) to just seven baskets for the game and scored 23 points off their turnovers. Nazareth also thrived in transition with 24 fast-break points. When Nazareth can score off miscues, its a tough team to beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We talk really well on defense, and it helps so much,” Gage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not always easy being a freshman trying to navigate varsity basketball, particularly against Nazareth’s challenging schedule, but Gage has shown she’s up for the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve learned to play my role well, and we’ve all just played as a team,” Gage said. “And as the games have gone on, we’ve just played so much better together, and I think that’s showing at the right time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior guard Sophia Towne scored 10 points, and senior guard Lyla Shelton added 11. Towne and Sakalas, a BYU commit, are two of the best players in their respective grades, but the Roadrunners are a well-rounded group with multiple threats on the court. Gage’s development throughout the season gives Nazareth another threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Gage] doesn’t play like a freshman,” Stritzel said. “She’s only going to get better and better. She’s a raw talent, and she wants to be great. She’s so long on that wing, and our guards put so much pressure on the ball, and then Mia and Stella played a passing lane . . . it’s a tough defense to play against.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Nazareth celebrated on the court, most of the players knew that there was still work to be done. They still have to win the supersectional game against Waubonsie Valley on Monday to advance in the IHSA state tournament. The Roadrunners haven’t lost since Dec. 30 — to an out-of-state team — and their last loss to an in-state opponent was Dec. 13 against Benet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been preparing for a long time, and we’re just thinking about winning seven games one time [to win the state championship],” Sakalas said. ‘‘[This was] just a team win. We played unselfish basketball, and that’s just what we want.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Heck, the Bulls coach doesn’t even feel the need to grab a sign that reads “Slow Down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His offense can’t afford to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too undersized, too inexperienced in playing with each other, and frankly just not good enough to be a lethal team in half-court sets. So while it would be easier on Donovan if his new-look roster was a bit better conditioned, he’s doing all he can to try and get them there – one mile per hour quicker at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One is you have to look at are they capable of playing that way?” Donovan said, when discussing the need to keep his offensive philosophy intact. “Now, are they conditioned for that? We’re trying to obviously get that done. The other point is if we don’t try and play in transition and play fast, we don’t have enough cohesiveness and chemistry to be this team where, ‘We’re going to out-execute you in the halfcourt.’ “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all the traded pieces that most disrupted what Donovan liked to do on the offensive end, center Nikola Vucevic’s role has been the hardest to try and replicate. Not only because of his skillset as a versatile big, but his IQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of what we did, and the biggest adjustment has been not having Vooch here,” Donovan said. “He was such a facilitator and a pocket player, a guy that can score at different levels, you ran offense through him. That’s taken away some of the package. If we try and play in the halfcourt, one, we don’t have enough (practice) time to work on that execution, and two, the way the league is going you want to play a little faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as the legs hold up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Donovan thinks the likes of Collin Sexton, Rob Dillingham and Anfernee Simons have the ability to play up-tempo basketball, their conditioning says otherwise. What the coach wants to avoid is more injuries than the Bulls already have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s been difficult for me is as much as you want to practice, you have guys coming into here that are playing more minutes now than they did at their prior teams,” Donovan added. “There is a concern medically that we’ve got to be careful that if these guys get ramped up so many minutes that these guys end up going out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Size matters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls’ frontcourt continued to thin out with Patrick Williams now in street clothes with a quad strain. The forward suffered the injury in the loss to Charlotte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His will probably be at least a week,” Donovan said of Williams’ timetable. “It could be longer, although I think they would try and ramp him up and do some more in about a week (after they) can get it to calm down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forward/center Jalen Smith remained sidelined with a calf issue and like Williams was at least a week away from starting to get reconditioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves undersized 6-foot-7 Guerschon Yabusele as the starting center for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Closer look&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Donovan is still figuring out exact roles and combinations for the roster, one player he has already tabbed as having a chance to be an improved defender down this final stretch is Sexton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That hasn’t been the guard’s reputation throughout his career, but Donovan said he felt the skill to do that was there.&lt;/p&gt;",

They were taken No. 1 and 2 overall in the 2015 MLB Draft. They debuted the next year and appeared in that All-Star Futures Game. They played against each other in the 2021 World Series, when Swanson’s Braves beat Bregman’s Astros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before all that, however, they were teammates on the 2014 USA Baseball collegiate national team, setting up a sweet reunion when Bregman signed a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/01/10/cubs-alex-bregman-agree-to-5-year-175-million-deal\"   &gt;five-year deal worth $175 million&lt;/a&gt;  with the Cubs this offseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had so much fun that summer,” Bregman said of that 2014 team. “It's one of those memories in the game that you'll never forget, of going out and competing for your country. So if you asked him, too, we both look super fondly back on that time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both playing SEC baseball, Bregman was LSU’s shortstop, and Swanson was at second base for Vanderbilt that year. They became a double play tandem for the United States’ college squad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's great playing up the middle with somebody who's just a superstar,” Bregman said of Swanson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That team traveled to North Carolina, the Netherlands and Cuba for five different events, playing teams that had traveled from all over the world, including Japan and Chinese Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was my first time playing baseball against different countries and cultures, really,” Swanson said. “So to be able to have that experience was pretty unique and special.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the years went on, Swanson and Bregman kept in touch periodically. They always had “competitive respect for one another,” as Swanson put it. But there wasn’t an opening for them to play together again until last spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman’s free agency was dragging on longer than expected. And the Cubs’ third base situation was murky after they included &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2024/12/13/kyle-tucker-trade-cubs-astros\"   &gt;Isaac Paredes in the trade with Houston for right fielder Kyle Tucker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When certain guys are obvious fits for what we want to be, it's not too hard to lobby,” Swanson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swanson’s lobbying fell in line with president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer’s thinking. But &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/02/12/what-alex-bregman-reportedly-signing-with-red-sox-means-for-cubs\"   &gt;Hoyer’s attempt to sign Bregman&lt;/a&gt;, even after convincing ownership to expand the offseason budget, fell short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bregman opted out of his Red Sox contract to hit free agency again this past winter, the Cubs made sure they didn’t whiff again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was pretty cool to share the infield with him [in 2014],” Bregman said. “Now we get to do it again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, both obsessed with winning, they’re intent on pushing this Cubs team deep into the playoffs. And now, a dozen years later, they’re far more polished versions of the players who led the collegiate national team to a 18-8-2 record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think he's someone that is going to be really good for me, just being able to ping thoughts and ideas off of,” Swanson said. “And someone that can help understand me, and me understand him. And us having that dialog with one another is going to be really helpful for, I think, both of us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, title=Latest on the Cubs, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, items=[{type=Image, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb/2026/02/26/mlb-umpire-bruce-froemming-who-called-milt-pappas-no-hitter-for-the-cubs-dies-at-age-86, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, timestamp=1772154485000, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb, isFeatured=false, category=[{items=[MLB]}], authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/associated-press, name=[{items=[AP]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, jobTitle=[], _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[{items=[The Associated Press is an independent, not-for-profit news cooperative headquartered in New York City.

Arichely is one of about 545 students who attend two high schools run by the financially-distressed Aspira Charter School Network. More than 90% of students at the two schools are Latino, more than two-thirds are low income and more than half are English Language Learners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of back-and-forth, Chicago Public Schools officials are telling students that the network does not have the money to make it through the school year and that they should transfer before the start of the last quarter “to safeguard their education stability.\" While there’s debate about whether it is CPS’ fault or Aspira’s, such a mid-year school closing is virtually unheard of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely, like other students, has a long list of concerns and questions about credits, grades, senior events and graduation. But she also has a more emotional worry. She lives far from her current school, Aspira Business and Finance Academy in Avondale, and, if she’s sent to her neighborhood school, she doesn’t think many of her friends will go there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She describes herself as shy and wonders what it will be like to walk into a new school three-quarters of the way into the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think my biggest issue is that I'm going to have to reintroduce myself to people that I don't know,” she said. “Now I'm gonna be all alone, and I'm not gonna have the people that I'm used to having.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-520000\" name=\"image-520000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de9ca2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+50/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fdc%2Febd3caf449508a44aa54b742e089%2Faspiraclosing-260227-16.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9cff274/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+50/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fdc%2Febd3caf449508a44aa54b742e089%2Faspiraclosing-260227-16.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff9e03c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+50/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fdc%2Febd3caf449508a44aa54b742e089%2Faspiraclosing-260227-16.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A poster of future events in jeopardy hangs on the door of Jose Torres’ classroom at ASPIRA Business &amp;amp; Finance High School, located at 2989 N.

At the Chicago Board of Education meeting Thursday, CPS officials addressed the students before explaining their decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not the outcome that anyone hoped for,” said Zabrina Evans, CPS executive director of Innovation and Incubation. “We understand the stress and difficulty of today's news. We understand the uncertainty and disruption that comes with changing schools in the middle of the current school year.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans then explained that getting to this point has been “long and complicated,” but that essentially Aspira, like all charter organizations, agreed to operate a school with the money provided by CPS and that Aspira has not been able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CPS provides funding and support, and charter operators deliver educational services to students,” she said. Not only has Aspira been unable to prove to the district that it can provide those educational services through June, but the charter operator has failed to turn over an audit and other required financial documents, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also noted that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2025/11/25/cps-to-help-aspira-make-payroll-but-charter-operators-financial-woes-remain\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;CPS has given Aspira $2.25 million in cash advances&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and yet the network still says it needs millions more to pay teachers and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS is “moving forward with this student transition process… due to the dire situation created by the failure of Aspira to demonstrate financial stability, which places the education of Aspira students at risk,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until Wednesday night, Aspira Chief Executive Director Edgar Lopez seemed hopeful that he could save the schools. He told CPS that he was meeting with a bank to get a bridge loan and looking at fundraising, even a crowdfunding campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But speaking at the board meeting, Lopez blamed CPS for the charter schools’ financial problems. He said charters get 83% of what district-run CPS schools receive, though school district officials refute that figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like charters are stepchildren to CPS,” he said. “Our families pay taxes just like all the rest of the families pay taxes. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lopez has also accused CPS of undermining charter schools through its high school application process by prioritizing sending students to district-run schools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-960000\" name=\"image-960000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7e0a4fd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/67074ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c0354c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A man wearing glasses and a yellow button-up shirt stands in a classroom.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c0354c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d902c3e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c0354c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspira’s executive director, Edgar Lopez, spoke with students at Aspira Business &amp;amp; Finance High School on Wednesday.

This year Aspira’s high schools started out with less than 600 students, some 200 less than five years ago. Charter school operators also cite other issues that have added to their financial troubles, including rising labor costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lopez told the board no “irregularities” will be found in Aspira’s finances and that it has had clean audits, but the one for last year is not yet complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pleaded with the board to keep the school intact, even if they remove Aspira management, at least until the end of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If this is for the kids, then worry about the kids,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘We should be celebrating our future’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely and dozens of other students and teachers attended Thursday’s meeting. Some of them assigned blame to Aspira and Lopez, while others said CPS is responsible and should do more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more than anything, they lamented the fact that they were caught in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Walsh, who teaches math at the Business and Finance Academy, cited a study that showed students are more likely to drop out of school, face violence and suffer from depression after a mid-year school closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said teachers like him will figure out how to make it through, but they are worried about the students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need assurances that the students will be looked after and they will face as little fracture as possible,” he said. “CPS needs to give them the dignity of an actionable plan that does not repeat history. This is your responsibility, unless you are resigned to make them another statistic.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students expressed frustration, but they also wanted to know what was going to happen next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Lavelle Turner said he was looking forward to his last season playing on the Aspira baseball team and getting ready to take tests to see if he could get college credit for advanced placement classes. He wanted to know whether he would even be able to play baseball and complete his AP classes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should not have to pay and sacrifice our future,” he said. “We should be celebrating our future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d80000\" name=\"image-d80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bc43a45/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f916013/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70fff7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Aspira Charter School students speak during a school board meeting at Chicago Public Schools in Chicago on Thursday, Feb. 26, 2026. | Talia Sprague/for the Sun-Times\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70fff7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9de36e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70fff7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspira Charter School students speak during a school board meeting Thursday at Chicago Public Schools in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talia Sprague/Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely is on track to go to Loyola University. But now she is wondering if she will graduate on time and whether the transition will affect her ability to get scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How would a teacher that doesn't really know who we are write a recommendation letter,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely and other seniors said they were dismayed by the idea that they won’t get to go to senior luncheon, Six Flags and prom with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely said she’s built a large group of friends and she looked forward to having fun with them, but if they aren’t at these events, she won’t go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think I'd feel a bit left out because I don't know anyone, and then I wouldn't feel comfortable going to a place or … participating in an activity without my friends,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Emilo Zurita said he is concerned that some students won’t even go to a new school, at least for the rest of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've heard them say if Aspira closes, they feel like dropping out because they don't feel safe in another school,” he said. “They'd rather drop out than be in a school where they could get shot or something could happen to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A warning for other charter schools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conrad Timbers-Ausar, CPS’ acting chief portfolio officer, said he is working on a transition plan including a list of high schools near Aspira that will guarantee a seat to the displaced students. He said these schools will have a designated transition coordinator who will do check-ins with students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also will be provided “wraparound services tailored to students needs including mentoring, tutoring, mental health services and more,” he told board members. “They will also be prepared to provide additional items like technology, uniforms and school gear that students may need to be successful in the school. Students will receive CPS bus cards to get safely to and from school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district will make sure that credits transfer and that students are able to complete classes, he said. Students will be given a letter to send to colleges explaining the transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Zaccor, a school board member who represents the North Side, said she wants to make sure students can play on spring sports teams. She also instructed CPS officials to look into arranging senior events, like prom and graduation, exclusively for Aspira students, even if they are no longer together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we need to think outside the box and make sure that those things happen,” she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debby Pope, who represents a different North Side district, called the situation a “terrible experience” and “unfair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she said she hopes this sends a warning to other charters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to behave responsibly,” she said. “You have to have your finances in order. You have to be transparent. You have to turn in your audits. We cannot do this to our children. It is just not okay.”&lt;/p&gt;",

The shop is scheduled to close Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no new owner on deck to take over Pride Cleaners, 558 E. 79th St., meaning there will be one less place for South Siders to get their clothes dry cleaned and tailored. And the closure also creates an uncertain future for one of Chicago's most unique modernist sites: an absolute showstopper of a building with its original sign — neither of which are under city landmark protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We are on the verge of losing [an unofficial] historical landmark,\" Ald. William Hall (6th) said. \"An economic engine, of sorts. And also on the verge of losing a part of our history.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built in 1959, Pride Cleaners was designed by Chicago architect Gerald Siegwart. The space race and postwar modernism were shaping nearly every element of U.S. design then, from tailfins rising from the rear decks of automobiles to the shape of household furnishings and, of course, architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Pride, Siegwart designed a building with a self-supporting hyperbolic paraboloid concrete roof that created an interior free of columns. Chicago largely is a flat-topped city, but Siegwart's roof starts at ground level at two anchor points then shoots heavenward at a radical angle. The design choice gives the cleaners building a base that is almost entirely glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there's the finishing touch: a parking lot sign that features the cleaner's name on electrified, lozenge-shape letters done-up in Pop Art colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building and its electric sign — winking and blinking in all its glory — can been seen in the 2001 film \"Ali.\" Will Smith, portraying the boxer, is driving past the cleaners when passersby tell him Malcolm X has been killed. And the cleaners exterior and sign appear in Chance the Rapper's 2025 music video for the tune \"Ride.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Very few commercial neighborhood buildings in our city capture that mid-century spirit and commands one's attention like Pride Cleaners,\" Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller said. \"The building is reminiscent of futuristic &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/googie-architecture-of-the-space-age-122837470/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Googie architecture&lt;/a&gt;, often seen in cities like Los Angeles but with few surviving examples in Chicago.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pride customer Freddie Macklin, who learned of the cleaners' closing when he visited Thursday, said, \"The building is alright to me.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pride's manager, who asked not to be named, said the new owners — out-of-towners who bought the business last year — told her two weeks ago the Chatham mainstay would be closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"How can you leave something like this?\" she said. \"Just leave it and abandon it.

If he walks away, who knows what's going to happen with it?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ehman said he will try to find a new owner for Pride. It might also be a good time for the city's Department of Planning and Development to wade in and help find new owners and seek landmarks status for this very special building and sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall said he wants to see the building reused before a landmark designation is pursued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I'd like to see another cleaners there,\" he said. \"You know, what good is a relic without revenue.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

The Sox might not see him again till the last days of spring training, depending on how the defending champions fare in the WBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami was slated to play first base in a Cactus League game against the Dodgers on Thursday before leaving to join teammates in advance of their March 6 WBC opener against Chinese Taipei, but he was scratched in the morning because of general soreness in what the Sox said was a “precautionary” move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”He was a full participant in our camp just ahead of a long flight [Friday] morning,” manager Will Venable said. “I thought it was in his best interest not to play today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami, who signed a two-year, $34 million deal in December, agreed. He took on a heavier workload than most Sox teammates in preparation for the WBC. Fatigue was setting in, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was ramping up at a very high speed,” he said Thursday, citing a tight schedule and daily work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was aggressive,” Venable said. “It’s really important we don’t ask him to do too much here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In four Cactus League games, Murakami was 5-for-13 with two doubles and five strikeouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no long balls in Arizona’s thin air for Murakami, who walloped 246 home runs in eight seasons in Japan, including 56 in 2022. He could get a hero’s welcome in his homeland. In the last WBC in 2023, Murakami swatted a walk-off double against Mexico in the semifinals and a home run against the United States in the championship game in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wants another title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to go into every single game to win it, and that’s my fullest goal,” Murakami said. “Go into the batter’s box with every intention of winning it every single game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venable said he’ll root for his new player, “even when he’s playing Team USA. Maybe not Team Japan as much. Just excited to see him do his thing and be tuned in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As first impressions go, Murakami hit one out of the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just loved the person,” Venable said. “His ability to be part of the group, this young group, his personality has been amazing. What really stuck out is we asked him to do things in his training and preparation that are different than what he’s done in the past. For someone [who has such conviction] in his preparation and who takes it so seriously, to be that adjustable has been cool to see. Excited about getting him back in the White Sox uniform again with the season starting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortstop Colson Montgomery said Murakami’s English improved just in recent weeks. He has enjoyed random chats about non-baseball things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had good conversations without his translator, and that shows a lot about him, that he’s willing to learn English a lot for the betterment of the team, for us being able to communicate with him, too,” Montgomery said. “He’s teaching us some words. He’s good. He’s a great addition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dodgers 7, Sox 6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left-hander &lt;b&gt;Sean Newcomb&lt;/b&gt;, who signed a one-year, $4.5 million free-agent deal, started and allowed two runs and four hits in two innings. He’s being stretched out as a starter but could pitch in a variety of relief roles, as well. Newcomb struck out two, including former Cub &lt;b&gt;Kyle Tucker &lt;/b&gt;to end the second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Second-year catcher &lt;b&gt;Kyle Teel &lt;/b&gt;made an impression. “He’s a real competitor back there; you can see it in his eyes,” Newcomb said. “He’s got bull horns kind of coming at you. He came out with the third hitter. I expected a how-you-feeling type of thing, and he was like, ‘Get in your legs! Let’s go!’ That kind of fired me up. Looking forward to working with him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Shortstop &lt;b&gt;Tanner Murray&lt;/b&gt;, trying to win a job in a utility role, hit his second home run in four games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;b&gt;On deck: &lt;/b&gt;Rangers at Sox, 2:05 p.m. Friday, Glendale, 1000-AM, &lt;b&gt;MacKenzie Gore &lt;/b&gt;vs.&lt;b&gt; Erick Fedde&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Sox at Brewers, 2:10 p.m.

Or consistently making the routine play and occasionally charging in or ranging up the middle to make an exceptional one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people in this clubhouse can have that leadership role,” Montgomery, who turns 24 Friday, said, “but you want to lead by example.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s what manager Will Venable is telling his players. Get out of the batter’s box hard, play hard, don’t take a pitch off or give up an at-bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And that’s all you can do,” Montgomery said. “And if that's a leadership role, a lot of us have that. That’s what everyone wants to do in here. Play as hard as they can, and the best they can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to recovering from a hitting funk to post an .840 OPS with after he was called up from Triple-A Charlotte for his debut on the Fourth of July, the 6-4 Montgomery, a high school first-round draft pick in 2021, seemed to put questions about whether he belonged at shortstop to rest, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like my defensive confidence is at an all-time high,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to his first step in the field, he attributes his steady defensive play to the focus and intent he alluded to talking about leadership. That starts with his pre-pitch setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because when I’m on time with that and I have the intent and mindset of the ball is being hit to me every single time, it keeps me more locked in and engaged every single play,” Montgomery said. “And makes me feel like I have better range, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery was ill and sidelined two days this week but quickly got back into the swing of things when he homered on a 3-0 pitch from the Reds’ Lyon Richardson on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After dealing with the disappointment of getting sent out of major league camp  last season, he finds himself entrenched as one of the rebuilding Sox’ higher-profile guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been on two different ends of it,” he said. “The end where you come in and you try to make the team and you feel like you’ve got all the world, the pressure on you and you come in and you have a lot less pressure to come in and do what you need to do to get yourself ready to play every day. I just feel like this year, in spring, I have a better understanding of what I have to do at the plate and even defensively. Not just in the game, but in my work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery’s offseason work has been apparent to Venable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He came into camp in great shape, really athletic,” Venable said Thursday. “He’s a high-performing athlete, it’s always nice to see those guys lean into that in their offseason work. He did that. It showed up on the field [Wednesday] with some of those plays, coming in. He looks great.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chatter at SoxFest Live suggested 40 homers in his sophomore season based on what he did in three months as a rookie, well-regarded statistical projection systems like ZiPS and Steamer have Montgomery under 25 homers and 130 games played, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery will keep his own projections to himself. In any case, it was good to put the first home run in camp on the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It just shows that if I’m committed to my plan, and committed in not trying to cheat to fastballs or try to do too much, that if I just can touch the ball, I can do damage,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListL\" data-module  data-hide-authors=\"true\"

He was 86.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froemming fell just after midnight Tuesday and hit his head on the hardwood floor at his home in Mequon, Wisconsin, and was taken to Ascension Columbia St. Mary's Hospital in Milwaukee, according to Froemming's son, Steven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had brain bleeding that medical personnel could not stop because Froemming was on blood thinners, leading to his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froemming was a semipro baseball player and started his umpiring career in the minor leagues in 1958 at age 18. He worked his way up and joined the National League staff in 1971. He shifted to the unified major league staff in 2000 and retired in 2007 having worked 5,163 games, second at the time to Bill Klem's 5,373. They were both surpassed by Joe West, who worked 5,460 games before retiring in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froemming started his umpiring career at a minor league game in Waterloo, Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I thought I was in heaven — on the ballfield, professional athletes, I was starting my professional career,\" he told The Associated Press days before his retirement. \"But never did you dream at the time, ever even think of going to a big league ballpark, because you had so far to go through the minor leagues to even get a chance.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He concluded that being a good umpire required \"probably being patient with yourself. ... You're going to make mistakes early on.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the most famous of the no-hitters he worked was on Sept. 2, 1972. Milt Pappas of the Cubs retired his first 26 batters and went to a 1-2 count on pinch-hitter Larry Stahl before walking him. Pappas then retired Garry Jestadt on a popup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froemming was behind the plate for three other no-hitters, by Ed Halicki (1975), Nolan Ryan (1981) and José Jiménez (1999). He worked five World Series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he retired, Froemming became a special assistant to MLB's vice president on umpiring,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is survived by his wife, the former Rosemarie Loch, whom he married in 1957; two sons, Steven and Kevin; sister Cathy Seizer; half-brother Johnny Froemming; and two grandchildren.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

who was accompanied by Father Michael Pfleger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We pray for his children and grandchildren,” Cardinal Cupich said from the pulpit. “Let them know that they follow in the footsteps of a man who was a giant for justice. And, in that way, his word will continue to live on well beyond his years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know there's a big hole in their hearts at this moment, and I just wanted to stand in solidarity with them,” Cupich told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That line of his to ‘keep hope alive’ was so important because he understood that hope is different than optimism,” Cupich said. “Optimism is about tomorrow. Hope is about today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside, scores of people waited along Drexel Avenue in the crisp but sunny weather as recordings of Jackson’s speeches blared from speakers. Many chanted “I am somebody” and “keep hope alive,” the signature rallying cries of the late reverend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-dd0000\" name=\"image-dd0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9692965/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/59bc46a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b89516b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"JJREPOSETHURS_260227-18.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b89516b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2c9a7b4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b89516b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flanked by family members, the Rev.

He had a very humorous side, but it was easy to talk with him,” said Holland, 68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recalled Jackson urging parents to “teach your children how to think.” It was a lesson she said she carried with her into motherhood, passing it down from her children to her grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will never forget that,” Holland said. “I know that I’ll remember that I am somebody.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-af0000\" name=\"image-af0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/549628b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0000883/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9898ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"DW0A0787.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9898ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a125a5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9898ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen Holland (left) and Julius Owens were CVS classmates when the Rev.

But she said she will never forget his efforts to fight for human rights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Edwards, 75, said Jackson motivated her as a young girl to go to college, becoming the first person in her family to receive a college degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He taught us that education was the road to success,”  Edwards said. Jackson not only encouraged her to pursue her own education, but also inspired her to lead by example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He said ‘once you get there, don’t forget to look back and bring somebody with you,’” Edwards added. “And that was always our motto, to help somebody along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘We’ve lost a voice’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pastor King James Camper, 60, of Richton Park, said Jackson’s path led him to go into ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He wasn’t traditional,” said Camper, who leads Camper’s Temple Church of God in Christ, in Gary, Indiana. “He was connected to the community and the people, and he connected religion with current events. It’s more than just seeking God but learning to live in this society and fight for rights with God’s help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the eldest attendees was Henry Jones, 93, a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, which Jackson joined in 1960. He said he was “humbled” and at a loss for words as he viewed Jackson and considered his life’s accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve lost a voice, we’ve lost a soldier,” Jones said. “We’ve lost someone who was always on the forefront.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f90000\" name=\"image-f90000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c7ad3cf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6b61b0c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c00782/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mayor Brandon Johnson hugs a supporter outside the Rainbow PUSH Coalition\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c00782/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f58eb21/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c00782/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayor Brandon Johnson hugs a supporter outside the Rainbow PUSH Coalition as hundreds of mourners pay their respects to Rev.

Privately, his peers say he's even more competitive than he lets on publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while Bedard would never admit it, weeks of watching Team Canada’s Olympic run — which fell just short — while he sat around idly surely lit a fire underneath him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fire was obvious Thursday. In fact, it resembled a blazing inferno. On a night when many of his Hawks teammates looked rusty in a 4-2 loss to the Predators, Bedard singlehandedly generated the majority of his team’s offense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He ripped his 24th goal off a savvy pass from &lt;b&gt;Ryan Greene&lt;/b&gt; in the second period, broke in alone on Predators goalie &lt;b&gt;Justus Annunen&lt;/b&gt; a full three additional times and hunted down loose pucks aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen of the Hawks’ 27 scoring chances occurred with Bedard on the ice. He also took faceoffs for the first time since his Dec. 12 shoulder injury, winning seven of 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the Connor we’ve seen lots of,” coach &lt;b&gt;Jeff Blashill&lt;/b&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;CONNOR BEDARD WITH A WICKED SHOT 🏒 &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/5GyHI1cSdy\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5GyHI1cSdy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; NHL (@NHL) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/NHL/status/2027205208346927410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 27, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Hawks let a 2-1 lead in the third period slip away. Predators veteran &lt;b&gt;Ryan O’Reilly &lt;/b&gt;outsmarted Hawks rookie &lt;b&gt;Sam Rinzel&lt;/b&gt; to tip in the game-winning goal with 3:15 left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bedard, striking his usual public humble tone, praised Greene and &lt;b&gt;Andre Burakovsky&lt;/b&gt; for setting him up for “five or six Grade A” chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s on me to put one more of those in and maybe it’s a different game,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;QB search&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears have found their franchise quarterback in &lt;b&gt;Caleb Williams&lt;/b&gt;, but the Hawks are still searching for their quarterback on the power play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They spread out reps between Rinzel, &lt;b&gt;Artyom Levshunov&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt; Kevin Korchinski&lt;/b&gt; and veteran &lt;b&gt;Matt Grzelcyk&lt;/b&gt; during the past week of practices. Although Rinzel quarterbacked the top unit Thursday, that job is very much available to claim during the stretch run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got [defensemen] that have shown they’re capable of being power-play guys,” Blashill said. “We’d like to see one or two guys grab it and show they’re elite at it. There’s a difference there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levshunov &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/01/30/blackhawks-artyom-levshunov-reset-break-foundational-skills-jeff-blashill\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;returned to the lineup&lt;/a&gt; Thursday and quarterbacked the second unit.

They worked on an entry with two drop passes and another entry with zero, where the initial puck-carrier sneaks into the zone on his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both new entries were on display during a successful third-period power play. A zero-drop entry by &lt;b&gt;Frank Nazar&lt;/b&gt; created one extended zone sequence. A minute later, a two-drop entry back to Bedard created another extended sequence culminating in a &lt;b&gt;Tyler Bertuzzi&lt;/b&gt; goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I like that [two-drop entry] where I can get that much speed and come in,” Bedard said. “I feel pretty confident about it when I have those gaps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Extra attacker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks haven’t practiced six-on-five situations (with the goalie pulled) much this season, but they finally did Monday. They converted a couple times in practice, so it’ll be interesting to see if that makes a difference down the stretch. They’re the only NHL team with zero goals in those situations. They came up empty again Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only one&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defenseman &lt;b&gt;Wyatt Kaiser&lt;/b&gt; is the Hawks’ lone injured player. He has resumed skating individually as he works his way back from a Feb. 4 knee injury and could return to action next week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The Bulls hold Portland’s lottery-protected first-round pick, but only if the Blazers make the playoffs. Otherwise, it carries over for another year through 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the red corner was the coach from Rockville Centre, New York, who continues spending long nights in the office trying to figure out how he can help will this mishmash of a roster to a victory. Billy Donovan doesn’t know any other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something had to give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 11th consecutive time, it was Donovan and the roster he has been given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of another high-turnover game — 20 in this one — the Bulls (24-36) stumbled to the worst month in franchise history with an 0-11 February, losing 121-112.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls got 20 points from Matas Buzelis, but even he wasn’t great on a 6-for-16 shooting night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that Karnisovas &amp;amp; Co. should have minded much. Portland’s win kept the Blazers in the No. 9 spot for the play-in, still trying to close in on the No. 8 Warriors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while Donovan wasn’t looking to offer a helping hand in that, he also wasn’t oblivious to the entire situation, especially with the prospect of adding a second first-round pick in a loaded class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The discussions I had with them when the trade deadline was finalized was, ‘Nothing has changed, try and get these guys to play to the best of their ability; we know it’s going to be somewhat challenging with seven new players,’ ’’ Donovan said. “Even talking to ownership, it’s been, ‘Hey, go out there and do your very best.’ There has been no indication from ownership or the front office of, ‘Hey, listen, if we finish here, here or here’ or ‘Listen, don’t worry about playing these guys; just play these guys.’ There’s been none of that at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Philosophically, I get the dynamics once June, whatever date that draft date is, I get how that impacts all of that. It’s not like I’m sitting over there saying, ‘Well, it’s a close game right now, let’s sit Josh [Giddey] and Tre [Jones] and Jalen [Smith].’ There has not been that. And I think if I did do that, they would say, ‘Listen, you need to put the best guys out there.’ ’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a nice idea for Donovan to hold on to, but with the pressure the front office is starting to feel, it’s not in its best interests to play the “best guys” at this point. It made sure of that by trading some of the team’s better guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Donovan needed a reminder of that, it came in the last minutes after a dunk by Leonard Miller cut the deficit to three with 3:37 left. Rather than build off that and continue the rally, the Bulls’ defense fell apart. Donovan’s squad was outscored 13-7 to close the game out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the third-longest losing streak in franchise history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not making excuses; we don’t think we’re 11-game-losing-streak bad,” forward Isaac Okoro said. “At this point, we just have to come to the game focused and do the little things right. Blocking out, not turning the ball over, not letting them get second-chance points. Just doing the little things, and we can win games.”&lt;/p&gt;",

For the last eight years, I have been in a relationship with an amazing woman. She has always had some control issues, but because of the love we share, I was able to look past them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've always been the one who paid for everything. I recently had some heart issues and was unable to work my part-time job, so my income was reduced. I was no longer able to continue to do the things she was used to. She recently retired and wants to do more traveling, which, at this time, I can't afford. This has caused friction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I put a ring on her finger, which she accepted with reservation, telling me she never wanted to get married or live together. She likes things the way they are. She recently told me she's no longer in love with me the way she had been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to think badly of her, but I think it's because of my health and financial issues. This hurts so bad. For some reason, I still love her and can't move on. I'm a hopeless romantic and a true gentleman. I'm gun-shy about trying again at 70, but I hate being alone and depressed. What do you suggest? — &lt;i&gt;DISILLUSIONED IN NEW JERSEY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR DISILLUSIONED:&lt;/b&gt; I am sorry you are depressed and hurting. From what you have written, I can only conclude that when you were paying for everything, your ladylove liked the ride she was on. Now that things have changed financially, she has jumped off, so to speak. You may not believe this right now, but you are lucky she has shown her true colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do not have to stay alone and depressed. You also do not have to participate in relationships that are all give and no take. With this in mind, look for women who are independent and willing to share some of the financial costs of a relationship. You may be surprised to find that there are many out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My wealthy uphill neighbor and I share a retaining wall, which has been damaged by her reckless irrigation practices. Since the damage can be seen only from my side, she's not concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An inspector recommended excavating on her side to allow waterproofing the wall and installing a drainpipe. I wanted to bring in a wall contractor to get an estimate, but she would not allow it. Evidently, she doesn't want any of the plants in her backyard disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, she notified me by certified mail that she would no longer communicate with me. The city says it doesn't get involved in beefs between neighbors. I'm at my wits' end. Any advice? — &lt;i&gt;HOG-TIED IN CALIFORNIA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR HOG-TIED:&lt;/b&gt; Because water causes erosion, it is only a matter of time before your property is affected by your neighbor's drainage. She may have sent you that certified letter on advice from her lawyer. This is why you now need to engage legal counsel of your own. She's a difficult person, and you need to protect yourself and your property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Schakowsky has endorsed Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss in the race, while Davis is trying to pass the baton to State Rep. LaShawn Ford, D-Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no wave of candidates clamoring for “Chuy” Garcia’s seat, though, mostly because the longtime Southwest Side congressman didn’t publicly announce he was retiring for health reasons until the end of the candidate filing period last fall. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2025/11/06/patty-garcia-chief-of-staff-jesus-chuy-garcia-successor-march-primary-congress\"   &gt;Patty Garcia, &lt;/a&gt;the congressman’s chief of staff, is the lone Democrat on the primary ballot.

U.S. Reps. Mike Quigley, elected in 2009, and Rep. Bill Foster, elected in 2013, likely will become the most senior members of the delegation. Rep. Mike Bost, elected in 2015, is poised to  become the most senior member of Illinois’ Republican delegation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cook County’s heated rivalries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longtime Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle is aiming to prevent any turnover in the office she’s held since 2010.

Brendan Reilly (42nd), who has criticized the length of her tenure and slammed growing county budgets. Preckwinkle calls him President Donald “Trump’s man in Chicago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi, who is trying to hold on for a third term over opposition from the Preckwinkle-led Cook County Democratic Party, which is endorsing his challenger, Lyons Township Assessor Patrick Hynes.&lt;/p&gt;",

The goal is to get them to change what they're doing, to do better, to not enable these companies anymore.

Neither company responded to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smith &amp;amp; Wesson’s a tiny little company with like a $300 million market cap. It's not not driving KPMG's business,” Perlman said. “It's remarkable that these CEOs and managing partners don't see the bigger picture here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With enough scrutiny, Jacobs said, “enough people are going to change auditors because of it, and that's going to affect them, and maybe then they'll do the right thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Perlman wants to target recruiters who he thinks will have trouble attracting talent in the next generation of corporate leaders. “I think we're going to be very successful in changing minds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the average consumer isn’t dealing with global accounting firms — or any of the machinery and industrial suppliers flagged in project’s latest tranche of alleged enablers — &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.hppeaceproject.org/scorecard/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;their website&lt;/a&gt; puts more familiar names on blast, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walmart gets dinged for online weapons sales, along with FedEx and UPS for delivering them. The same goes for major sporting good companies like Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s, which didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walmart, which stopped selling AR-15-style rifles in 2015 and halted sales of ammunition for military-style weapons in 2019, says on its website that \"our heritage as a company has always been in serving sportsmen and hunters, and we plan to continue to do so in a responsible way.\" The company doesn't sell handguns either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also listed as an \"enabler\" is Amazon, which prohibits firearm sales but carries other products from companies that produce guns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perlman said the Peace Project has gotten muted responses from companies notified that they had landed on the database of “enablers,” with some law firms and businesses privately pleading to be removed and others standing firmly with their clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endorsed by the nonprofit research group are Costco and REI, which have shunned weapon manufacturers, as well as Apple Pay and PayPal, which don’t allow their platforms to be used for gun or ammunition purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacobs and Perlman rate dozens more companies across the finance, tech and manufacturing industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People want to do something and people don't know what to do, people at all levels, everyday consumers like you and me as well as high-powered decision makers at corporations,” Jacobs said. “Everyone who cares about this issue, everyone who cares about their children and wants to do something — this is such an easy thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;",

Commercial value has been dropping as large businesses and wealthy land owners appeal assessments at higher rates — and more successfully — shifting more of the burden onto  low income home owners,

He said circuit breaker laws would be costly and could be avoided had the assessment stayed on track with market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He admits there are “no magic beans,” but said the office has an \"embarrassment of riches” when it comes to tools at its disposal to improve the system.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are causing real harm to people at times when we get it wrong,” Hynes said. “Even in a hot market, we don’t have that kind of wild adjustment in value.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaegi’s early tenure saw some positive change. Christopher Berry, a professor of public policy at University of Chicago and director of the school’s Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation, said Kaegi has reduced overassessments for lower value homes and underassessments on higher value homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a break from former assessor Joe Berrios, whose assessment methods often favored wealthier property owners and allowed them to pay less in property taxes than those in low-income and minority communities. One of Kaegi’s first moves was adopting a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://prodassets.cookcountyassessoril.gov/s3fs-public/page_comm/ExecutiveOrder.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;new code of ethics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f70000\" name=\"image-f70000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9ad141a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1f%2Fe4%2F7476cc5445eebfab6b0e94c53314%2Fwtkassessor-260206-12-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1a8a9b4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1f%2Fe4%2F7476cc5445eebfab6b0e94c53314%2Fwtkassessor-260206-12-1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a583d16/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1f%2Fe4%2F7476cc5445eebfab6b0e94c53314%2Fwtkassessor-260206-12-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Lyons Township Assessor Pat Hynes speaks about why he is running for Cook County Assessor at IBEW Local 134 at 2722 S.

People are seeing their taxes go up regardless of the fact that the assessments are more fair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hynes has touted cracking down on properties that have undergone construction that he says the assessor’s office has missed, including properties in his own jurisdiction. He wants to expand field inspector teams and use AI tools on satellite imagery to better identify new construction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You assess according to the law and the market, it should move at a slow, predictable pace,” Hynes said. “Think of the buildings that weren’t built because they were chased away by an erratic property tax system... If they don’t build it, we can’t tax it, and then we can’t spread that burden around to provide relief for taxpayers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/how-to-vote-illinois-primary\"   &gt;How to cast your ballot in the March 2026 Illinois primary&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/what-to-know-democratic-primary-cook-county-assessor-fritz-kaegi-pat-hynes\"   &gt;What to know about the Democratic primary race for Cook County assessor&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/cook-county-board-president-democratic-primary-what-to-know-preckwinkle-reilly\"   &gt;What to know about the Democratic primary for Cook County board president&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kaegi has shot back about Hynes taking contributions from property tax lawyers. Campaign finance records show Hynes has taken nearly $70,000 from at least 43 different lawyers employed by firms providing property tax services, or the firms themselves, since Sept. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes nearly $10,000 from lawyers at Worsek and Vihon, a property tax law firm that boasts it led to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wvproptax.com/recent-decisions/#\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;recent reductions of more than $3 million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for several Cook County properties, according to campaign contribution data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaegi took a $1,032 donation from a lawyer at Kirkland &amp;amp; Ellis, which provides tax dispute services for clients. Lawyers at the firm also donated $7,500 to Hynes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hynes has pointed to the tens of thousands of dollars Kaegi has taken from developers, construction companies and others in the real estate field — including $25,000 from investor Stephen Schuler at Wicklow Capital and $5,000 from K&amp;amp;J Builders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the challenger has also taken nearly $60,000 alone from those involved with 150 N. Riverside, a property along the riverfront  which saw its last appeal to the assessor’s office shut down in 2018 — the year Kaegi took office. David Carlins, CEO of Magellan Development, a luxury rental and condo developer who has worked on projects such as the St. Regis skyscraper, also dropped $40,000 on Hynes’ campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a very wide swath of support for the campaign, including those active in the real estate market,” Hynes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-3a0000\" name=\"module-3a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Illinois 2026 primary election schedule&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feb. 5&lt;/b&gt;: Early voting and vote by mail begins&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 1&lt;/b&gt;: Online voter registration ends, but voters may register in person at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.elections.il.gov/VotingAndRegistrationSystems/EarlyVotingLocationsSearch.aspx\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;election authority and early voting sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 12&lt;/b&gt;: Deadline for online and posted applications to vote by mail; in-person requests for absentee ballots may be made through March 16&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 17&lt;/b&gt;: Polls open for Primary Election Day from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 31&lt;/b&gt;: Deadline to return absentee ballots postmarked on or before Primary Election Day&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/08/04/cook-county-assessor-misclassifies-hundreds-of-properties/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/01/17/senior-freeze-property-tax-exemption-fritz-kaegi-armando-saleh-cook-county-assessor-jill-fitzgerald\"   &gt;City Hall lobbyist pays $96,000 for tax breaks Sun-Times showed he never should have been given&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2024/11/15/senior-freeze-property-tax-fritz-kaegi-cook-county-assessor\"   &gt;Fritz Kaegi OK’d tax breaks for ‘low-income’ seniors, now demands proof they qualify amid Sun-Times probe&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/7/8/23199200/property-tax-breaks-exemptions-errors-cook-county-assessor-fritz-kaegi-barbara-kaplan-israel-martin\"   &gt;Pay up, Cook County orders homeowners after Sun-Times exposed wrongful property tax breaks&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/05/23/fritz-kaegi-cook-county-assessor-wrongful-tax-breaks-erroneous-exemptions-walter-burnett\"   &gt;Cook County assessor gave $930,000 in wrongful tax breaks, then waived penalties, interest over its errors&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

She was buried in south suburban Glenwood alongside her mother — also an influential music teacher on the South Side, where Bonds grew up and spent her early career. Despite her stature in American music history, however, Bonds’ own grave is unmarked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will soon change. This weekend, Northwestern University — Bonds’ alma mater — hosts a ceremony and performance dedicating a new headstone. A rendering of the marker will be shown to the public, then installed later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malcolm J. Merriweather, a specialist in Bonds’ music who leads the New York Philharmonic Chorus, says it came to his attention that the late composer did not have a headstone during a conversation with her great-niece last year. Along with Bonds’ descendant, Merriweather used his personal funds to pay for the headstone outright, which included proceeds from his own arrangements of Bonds’ music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think a characteristic of Black life is making sure those who have gone before us are taken care of,” Merriweather said. “We both decided that we were going to make it happen for this incredible composer, educator, pianist and performer that has inspired so many of us in our careers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c20000\" name=\"image-c20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1278ad0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F6f%2Fcb35e4cb4f6892cdff9f6e530ba9%2Fbondsmusic-2602270177.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2344214/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F6f%2Fcb35e4cb4f6892cdff9f6e530ba9%2Fbondsmusic-2602270177.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df205c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F6f%2Fcb35e4cb4f6892cdff9f6e530ba9%2Fbondsmusic-2602270177.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Sidney Jackson Jr., President and CEO of Chicago Sinfonietta poses for a portrait along the Chicago River in downtown Chicago on February 26, 2026. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df205c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F6f%2Fcb35e4cb4f6892cdff9f6e530ba9%2Fbondsmusic-2602270177.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2d04959/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F6f%2Fcb35e4cb4f6892cdff9f6e530ba9%2Fbondsmusic-2602270177.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df205c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F6f%2Fcb35e4cb4f6892cdff9f6e530ba9%2Fbondsmusic-2602270177.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s always been Sinfonietta’s mission to champion composers and artists of color as well as women.

The Sinfonietta has championed Bonds’ music, most recently her “Montgomery Variations,” composed after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. According to Jackson, many musicians participating in this weekend’s concert are donating their time for the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's always been Sinfonietta’s mission to champion composers and artists of color as well as women. To honor Margaret Bonds’ legacy with this project was a natural fit,” Jackson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort recalls a similar one to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://weta.org/fm/classical-score/weta-classical-listener-installs-grave-marker-florence-price\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;install a marker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the grave of composer &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/curious-city/2022/07/21/who-was-florence-price\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Florence Price&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who provided essential mentorship to Bonds as a fellow Black female composer living on Chicago’s South Side. Price is also buried in the south Chicago suburbs, at Lincoln Cemetery in Blue Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonds studied at Chicago Musical College before enrolling at Northwestern University at just 16. After getting a bachelor’s and master’s at Northwestern, she pursued further study at The Juilliard School in New York City. She lived and worked there as well as Los Angeles, where she died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonds’ years at Northwestern were unhappy ones. She was not permitted to live or practice piano on campus, like her white peers. She sought refuge at the Evanston Public Library, whose basement bookshelves became something of an escape. There, she stumbled upon Langston Hughes’ “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was in this prejudiced university, this terribly prejudiced place,” she reflected later, “and I know that poem helped save me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hughes would become her most important collaborator and a dear friend. She frequently set his writing to music, including “The Ballad of the Brown King,” which CBS featured in a 1960 Christmas broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQE-S3b4FA0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"The Ballad of the Brown King: I.

Before she retired in 2023, Montgomery kept a picture of Bonds in her office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I think of anyone who looks like me going to a historically white institution in the 1930s, I just think it's amazing,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Friday’s dedication concert at Northwestern’s Pick-Staiger Concert Hall will feature Chicago Sinfonietta musicians, as well as guest singers. The Kenwood United Church of Christ will host a panel with Bonds performers and researchers the following day. Both are free and open to the public.

Jan Schakowsky’s seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen, an economist from Evanston, says he staunchly supports the U.S.-Israel alliance and was interested in hearing from the group that has championed that cause for decades. At the same time, he does not believe U.S. military aid to Israel should be a blank check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting was at a coffee shop and lasted an hour. Cohen says he expressed support for Israel but “probably sounded like someone who was going to take a very hard look” at the country’s “behavior” in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen never heard back from AIPAC. Then he noticed a deluge of donations from around the country for another candidate — a state senator who had not called for stricter conditions on aid to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen is among several Democrats in four wide-open Chicago-area congressional primaries to have met with AIPAC and learned the group has drawn a hard line on one thing: unconditional U.S. military aid to Israel. The topic has become a flashpoint for candidates and voters as more Democrats call for improving human rights in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC donors and affiliates have spent more than $10.6 million on the group’s preferred candidates in the four races, a WBEZ analysis of federal campaign disclosures found. Those candidates, meantime, have evaded most questions, or favored Israel, in a WBEZ survey about U.S. support for Israel and the war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WBEZ surveyed the 46 candidates in the Chicago area’s four hard-fought Democratic congressional primaries about whether there should be strict U.S. conditions on military aid to Israel, whether that country has committed genocide in Gaza, and whether AIPAC funding should be off-limits in these races.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the respondents said yes to those questions, but the four AIPAC-aligned candidates would not answer yes or no.&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big campaign spending isn’t new for AIPAC, which has been around for 72 years. But the group is operating more covertly than ever, Democratic strategists say. AIPAC is working through newly formed political action committees that are hard to trace and that bankroll campaign mailers, phone calls and TV commercials. So far, that publicity hasn’t mentioned the Middle East, focusing instead on things like immigration and affordability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC has not responded to WBEZ questions about its candidate selection criteria or Chicago-area tactics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re trying to influence these elections … by invoking other issues that have nothing to do with Israel,” says veteran political consultant David Axelrod, who was chief strategist and senior advisor to President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t unusual in American politics,” he adds. “But given the volatility of issues involving Israel now, it’s conspicuous in this case that they’re working so hard to submerge their own participation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Secretive spending&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIPAC-linked candidates — all Democrats — include Cook County Commissioner Donna Miller in the 2nd District, Chicago City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin in the 7th, former U.S. Rep. Melissa Bean in the 8th and state Sen. Laura Fine in the 9th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC is supporting them in two main ways. The first is steering AIPAC donors to the candidates through online fundraisers, in-person events and email solicitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, 1,726 donors to AIPAC or its main super PAC had contributed to at least one of the four candidates by the start of the year, according to the WBEZ analysis. Of those donors, 1,524 (88.3%) lived outside Illinois and nearly a third contributed to more than one of the candidates. The AIPAC-linked donations totaled nearly $2.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates receiving those donations have depicted the link to AIPAC as a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second way AIPAC has propelled the Chicago-area candidates is through super PACs, which cannot donate directly to candidates or coordinate with them but can raise and spend unlimited sums on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC-tied super PACs have spent more than $7.7 million on TV ads, phone outreach and mailers for the four candidates, according to federal filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC, a national lobbying organization with more than 6 million members, tries to ensure U.S. policies and public perception favor Israel. The group spends big on Republican and Democratic candidates alike and aggressively targets Israel critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But AIPAC over the years has fallen out of favor with some Democrats and Jewish progressives who have recoiled from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s tactics in Gaza and from AIPAC’s backing of Republicans who &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/aipac-pro-israel-group-backs-insurrectionist-republicans\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;voted to overturn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the 2020 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois’ two-term Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, believes AIPAC has “abandoned their principles.” Pritzker, the state’s third Jewish governor, was a driving force behind construction of the Illinois Holocaust Museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because they donate to certain Democrats doesn’t change the fact that they are heeding the words and direction of Jared Kushner and other Trump acolytes,” Pritzker campaign spokesman Alex Gough said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker is not alone with that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no question they’re right-wing,” says Steve Sheffey, who writes the Jewish newsletter The Fine Print and was an AIPAC member for 25 years. “They wouldn’t think of themselves as that, but they are right-wing on the issue that they advocate for, and also right-wing in who they support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Axelrod says that reputation has pushed AIPAC to operate “under the cloak of darkness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Younger Jews who aren’t as steeped in [Israeli] history may have been horrified by what happened on Oct. 7 but then were horrified by what followed,” Axelrod says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamas killed more than 1,200 people during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel, according to Israeli officials. More than 72,000 Palestinians have been killed since, according to Gaza health officials. Some died during a food shortage that a U.N. panel declared was a famine. A slew of human rights groups have concluded Israel has committed genocide in Gaza — a finding that Israel denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC has shown interest in Chicago-area Democratic congressional primaries that seem to be wide open after the retirement of longtime incumbents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With these four districts, where it can be anybody’s game, they’re heavily invested,” says Nick Sous, an organizer with the U.S. Palestinian Community Network, which is critical of AIPAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC has a chance in three of the races to replace incumbents increasingly critical of weapons sales to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Robin Kelly, who is stepping down to run for retiring U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin’s seat, and retiring Reps. Danny Davis and Schakowsky signed onto the “Block the Bombs” bill last year. The measure would place more stringent human rights conditions on the sale of certain weapons — like bunker-busting bombs that can tear through concrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re trying to force a power shift,” says Sous, whose group has pushed Illinois politicians to sign onto the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shell PACs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newly formed super PACs with ties to AIPAC cropped up in January, joining the United Democracy Project, which has been active for four years and is throwing its weight behind Conyears-Ervin in the race for the 7th District, which stretches from the western suburbs to some Downtown and South Side areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The websites of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://affordablechicagonow.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Affordable Chicago Now&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://electchicagowomen.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Elect Chicago Women&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; include no information about Bean, Fine or Miller and no mention of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committees’ ties to AIPAC and UDP aren’t obvious. But a WBEZ review of federal and state disclosures found the groups identifying shared registered agents and vendors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their TV commercials and mailers have contained no reference to Israel. They have focused on domestic issues such as health care and immigration enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither ACN nor ECW responded to WBEZ questions on why the groups have poured millions of dollars into Fine, Miller and Beans’ candidacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2nd Congressional District, which covers part of the South Side and some nearby suburbs and rural areas, Miller is among 11 Democratic candidates vying to replace Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to nearly $1.5 million in super PAC spending, Miller has received a huge amount directly from AIPAC donors. They accounted for more than 72% of her $1.3 million in total receipts at the start of the year, according to the WBEZ analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-100000\" name=\"html-embed-module-100000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27812440\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27812440/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 578, or 65%, of her individual donors had contributed to AIPAC or UDP, the analysis shows. Of those, 515 (89%) lived outside Illinois. Since 2021, those donors and their immediate family members had given more than $28.5 million to the two PACs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Miller leans into a technical truth: “AIPAC has not given me any campaign contributions,” she told WBEZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a forum this month, Miller said she had received funds from a “broad base.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think that money coming into your campaign decides how you’re going to legislate, how you’re going to effectuate change in your district,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller’s campaign this week circulated a letter from Jewish leaders, including U.S. Rep. Brad Schneider and Chicago Ald. Debra Silverstein, that paints AIPAC’s role in the race as “Jewish engagement” and warns that criticizing the engagement “risks reinforcing harmful narratives at a time when antisemitism is rising.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Miller’s AIPAC support led to her &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/19/rep-jan-schakowsky-withdrawal-donna-miller-endorsement-2nd-congressional-district-aipac-support\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;losing Schakowsky’s endorsement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this month. The longtime congresswoman, who is Jewish, said Illinois “deserves leaders who put voters first, not AIPAC.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ground skirmishes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC’s role is drawing fire from progressive candidates, especially in the 9th Congressional District, which stretches from the North Side to several northern and northwestern suburbs. The district is home to many Israelis and Palestinians, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which doesn’t track religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that primary, federal campaign finance records show, Elect Chicago Women has shelled out $1.4 million for Fine, the state senator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine has also landed huge sums of AIPAC-tied cash. At least 987, or 67%, of her individual donors by the start of this year had contributed to AIPAC or UDP, the WBEZ analysis shows. Of those, 851 (86%) lived outside Illinois. The AIPAC-linked donors accounted for 73% of her $1.9 million in total receipts. Since 2021, the donors and their immediate family members have given more than $46 million to those pro-Israel committees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has become an issue for Fine in recent weeks. At a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://x.com/DanielBiss/status/2024672880714301700?s=20\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;forum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, candidates were handed signs with “yes” on one side and “no” on the other and asked a series of single-answer questions. When the moderator queried the group about whether they accepted money from AIPAC or its supporters, Fine was the only candidate among six on-stage to hold up a “yes” sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss posted video of the moment on his X account and drew nearly 22,000 views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She supports a blank check of military aid for Israel,” said Biss, who is Jewish and frequently talks up his ties to Israel but increasingly criticizes its actions. “That is a right-wing policy that is bad for Palestinians, Jews, Israelis, America and the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine, also Jewish, hit back, saying Biss himself took AIPAC-connected money in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elect Chicago Women last weekend unveiled its first negative TV ad against Biss, accusing him of “saying anything to get elected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-810000\" name=\"html-embed-module-810000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27815367\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27815367/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 8th Congressional District, which covers some western and northwestern suburbs, Bean is among candidates hoping to replace Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who is running for Durbin’s Senate seat. She has benefited from $2.6 million in AIPAC-linked super PAC spending and, by the start of the year, her campaign had received more than a half-million dollars from AIPAC donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 314, or 57%, of Bean’s individual donors have also contributed to AIPAC or UDP since 2021, the WBEZ analysis shows. Of those, 272 (87%) lived outside Illinois. Those donors accounted for more than 39% of her $1.3 million in total receipts by the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a news conference focused on AIPAC spending, Bean rival Junaid Ahmed accused her of selling her candidacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Melissa Bean will take their millions and then rubber stamp billions in unchecked military aid to Israel. Melissa Bean will look the other way as Israel commits a genocide,” said Ahmed, a director at a cloud computing firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to WBEZ’s survey, Bean declined to provide yes-or-no answers but added, “I support a two-state solution in the Middle East that allows both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace, safety and dignity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-f50000\" name=\"html-embed-module-f50000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27815247\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27815247/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC has also been accused of parachuting into majority-Black areas where, candidates say, U.S.-Israel relations are not a top concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re not investing in our schools. They’re not supporting the marginalized,\" said Anthony Driver, who is running to replace Davis. “The 7th District is not for sale. My community is not for sale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters, a 2nd District candidate, stood with Driver at the AIPAC-focused news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m Black and Jewish and … AIPAC is not my friend,” Petershe said. “[I]t gets conflated that AIPAC is about Jewish safety. I want to dissuade that. It is about Israel. Jewish safety comes through solidarity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Choosing favorites&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whopping 46 Democrats are running across the four congressional primaries. Most respondents to the WBEZ survey showed support for Palestinian rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than two-thirds of respondents answered they would denounce AIPAC funding if offered. Two-thirds said they support strict human rights conditions on aid to Israel. More than half said they believe Israel has committed genocide in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four AIPAC-linked candidates were among a minority of respondents who declined to provide yes-or-no answers to a majority of questions. Conyears-Ervin did answer one question with a straightforward answer, saying she would not oppose sending U.S. military aid to Israel today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some primary contenders say AIPAC has a litmus test for choosing whom to back: Does the candidate support unconditional U.S. aid to Israel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A “no” answer is disqualifying, according to candidates in the 2nd, 8th and 9th districts who took meetings with either AIPAC or the United Democracy Project, the group’s super PAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Rep. La Shawn Ford, D-Chicago, another candidate running to replace Davis, met with AIPAC late last year at a community graduation in his district. The AIPAC representative stressed the effect of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel, telling Ford, “You have to remember that date,” the candidate recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford’s impression was that AIPAC would support candidates only if they oppose the “Block the Bombs” bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIPAC contact, whom Ford would not identify, eventually called him with news that the group would instead support Conyears-Ervin “and that they’re going to come out hard for her,” Ford recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC’s spending has been most transparent in that race, where it is supporting Conyears-Ervin to the tune of $1.5 million through the UDP, whose donors through December have been disclosed. AIPAC’s role in that district, the 7th, has also evolved. At first, its donors were showering hundreds of thousands of dollars on River North developer Jason Friedman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a message to WBEZ, Conyears-Ervin responded to accusations that AIPAC’s support would influence her voting in Congress: “The idea that a Black woman’s vote is for sale is insulting and racist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-900000\" name=\"html-embed-module-900000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27813578\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27813578/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Sen. Willie Preston, D-Chicago, running to replace Kelly in the 2nd, also spoke with AIPAC but says it seemed the group sought “100% control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problem with AIPAC is that they are looking for slaves,” says Preston, chair of the Illinois Senate Black Caucus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither AIPAC nor UDP responded to requests for comment about the alleged litmus test, but UDP spokesperson Patrick Dorton described it to the Jewish Telegraph this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going to have a focus on stopping candidates who are detractors of Israel or who want to put conditions on aid,” Dorton said.&lt;/p&gt;",

With the progress, the team hosted a few small-scale concerts and opened the doors to public tours during the Chicago Architecture’s Open House weekend that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there were challenges in closing the gap on the additional funding needed. Because Double Door had not been active for years, with no recent tax records or revenue, it was considered a new business, which can be viewed as high-risk to some lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d50000\" name=\"image-d50000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f008622/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1c%2F36%2F56bedee34673a82a0205d2e831c3%2Fmulroney-031222-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/11c826d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1c%2F36%2F56bedee34673a82a0205d2e831c3%2Fmulroney-031222-2.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/402a961/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1c%2F36%2F56bedee34673a82a0205d2e831c3%2Fmulroney-031222-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Sean Mulroney, owner of Double Door sits inside the location of the new double door which is inside an old bank building at 1050 West Wilson Avenue, in the Uptown neighborhood, Friday, March 11, 2022.

Access to the $5 million grant eventually expired, and the team worked “down to the wire” to try to find alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's a shame because it’s a stunning facility. But the thing is, with these old theaters, they're really, really expensive to redo,” he said. “While the inside would have been spectacular, the size would only have been a little bit bigger than the [original] Double Door in terms of capacity, except the cost was exponentially more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That meant he’d be looking to book programming on at least five and up to seven nights a week to even try to break even, but it wasn’t a sustainable plan. “There’s competition — less people are touring and less people are buying tickets,” Mulroney said. “And given the climate we are in economically and the change in behavior of young folks who can’t afford to always go out and are drinking less, the amount to redo a historic building for that purpose was not feasible financially.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Double Door setback comes at the same time that another historic venue revival is gaining traction. On Feb. 21, Ald. Daniel La Spata (1st), posted a&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2698590633837486\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;video on social media&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; previewing “a new era” for the Congress Theater, which has been closed since 2013. It comes after developers secured a&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/01/14/landmark-congress-theater-federal-loan-preservation-finance-committee-city-council\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;$25 million federal loan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; backed by city funds. Unlike the indie Double Door, though, the Congress has considerable corporate backing as it is operated by AEG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wish the city would look at us and go, you’re bringing 62 jobs and $8 million in revenue to this community every year, maybe we can give you a hand a little more than the $5 million,” he countered. “But at some point, the little guys can't afford it and I'm a little guy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same lack of access to funding amid inflated costs has been affecting bottom lines for a number of independent entertainment venues across the city; as Sun-Times &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/music/2026/02/03/chicago-indie-venues-health-metro-ramova-salt-shed\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;recently reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, only one in four is currently profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Mulroney has not given up hope. He still plans to bring Double Door back to life in a new spot in the near future, given a different venue and financial scenario. “I still am looking for another home for the Double Door, and there are some very good possibilities,” he said, noting he’s zeroing in on the Logan Square and Avondale neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Mulroney has partnered with Gallery Cabaret, the long-running bar and performance space in Bucktown, helping to revive it after current owner Mike Strandberg briefly closed shop the past two months to re-evaluate operations. There’s a soft opening planned for March 1, with events planned through April. “I'm going to start putting some of my people in there and some bands. I’ve got all of these ideas I want to try out,” said Mulroney, aiming to hold true to Double Door’s original formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The venue was known for its eclectic lineups, and what set it apart was how it treated every band like a headliner on a national tour, Mulroney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“'If the talent loves it, that comes across to the audience. And there's no better feeling in the world than walking in the room with a band that's on stage and realizing that all those people are having as good a time as I was.”&lt;/p&gt;",

A federal prosecution is intimidating. It carries the threat of prison time. Damaging news stories spread online. Freedoms are often restricted, even in minor cases. Lawyers are needed, though federal defenders have saved people from big legal bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 17 cleared defendants spent a combined 150 days in federal custody, records show. That doesn’t include 35 days, and counting, that Juan Espinoza Martinez has been held by immigration authorities &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/01/22/federal-jury-rejects-bovino-murder-plot-after-called-upon-stand-up-overreaching-government\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;since he was acquitted&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly placing a hit on Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official who became the face of the deportation operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s to say nothing of the flesh-and-blood cost borne by Marimar Martinez, the woman &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/03/marimar-martinez-shot-border-patrol-chicago-speaks-out-after-good-pretti-deaths-i-am-their-voice\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;shot five times by a Border Patrol agent&lt;/a&gt; on the Southwest Side in early October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes aren’t so high in every case. Jackie Guataquira, whose four-month old misdemeanor case was recently dropped, said she never spent a night in jail and didn’t have to physically appear in court. But the prosecution kept her from visiting family in Mexico, Guataquira said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It just shows “they want to come for people at every single level,” she told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re really just trying to take people’s lives away, deport them out of this country, or at the … more minor level, paint people who are righteously protesting and standing up to this as ‘terrorists,’” she said. “They’re slapping these people’s photos all over social media for this, just to get people away from being able to protest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘Your life gets turned upside down’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors are expected to bring charges only when they can prove them to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Normally, they boast &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/14/fewer-than-1-of-defendants-in-federal-criminal-cases-were-acquitted-in-2022/#:~:text=This%20analysis%20is%20based%20on,Office%20of%20the%20U.S.%20Courts\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;a conviction rate of around 90%&lt;/a&gt;. But Trump’s Justice Department has suffered a string of high-profile losses tied to its national immigration campaign, including in a recent &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-02-06/federal-public-defenders-winning\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;six-case losing streak&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/05/30/andrew-boutros-interim-us-attorney-chicago-judges-role-pam-bondi\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;U.S. Attorney Andrew Boutros’&lt;/a&gt; office is looking at a best-case conviction rate of around 47% in such cases. That’s assuming it secures a conviction against each of the remaining 15 defendants, and no additional charges are brought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boutros said many of the cases were brought as a result of “reactive arrests” in the field. Some of them were better suited for state court, he said. Others were dropped out of concern that jurors would reject charges even when they’re proven, or for mitigating factors like mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our grace should not be confused as a reflection of the strength of any particular case or whether a charge should have been filed,” Boutros said in a statement. “It is a testament to our view that the role of the prosecutor is to seek justice and not just convict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We decide cases based on facts, law, and equities without regard to the attitude of sneering disbelief held by a certain group of critics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-6e0000\" name=\"html-embed-module-6e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-table\" data-src=\"visualisation/27349648\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27349648/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"table visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Pam Bondi &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/03/28/former-prosecutor-andrew-boutros-named-chicagos-interim-u-s-attorney\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;initially appointed Boutros&lt;/a&gt; to his job on a temporary basis in early 2025. Chicago’s U.S. District Court judges then &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2025/07/25/chicagos-federal-judges-choose-andrew-boutros-as-top-prosecutor\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;picked him to serve&lt;/a&gt; on a more permanent basis once Bondi’s appointment expired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said there are “enormous consequences” when someone is charged with a federal crime. That’s true even if the prosecution is abandoned, Levenson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your life gets turned upside down when you’re charged with a federal case,” Levenson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the greater cost, she said, is to “the credibility of the justice system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Charges dropped — but damage is done &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities arrested Collins, 32, and Robledo, 30, on Sept. 27 outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, which became a hub for fierce protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days earlier, a shooter opened fire on an ICE facility&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in Dallas. Emotions ran high. Without naming the couple, Bovino referred to Collins and Robledo online as “two deranged individuals, armed with pistols.” Users on X shared &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/1972684789028171930\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;his social media post&lt;/a&gt; 278 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t find out the hard way,” Bovino wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins and Robledo never faced any charges related to the guns,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;which they were lawfully carrying and never brandished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, a criminal complaint alleged that Robledo ignored commands and pushed back when law enforcement told people to move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once officers began to struggle with Robledo, Collins allegedly yelled at them to get away and charged toward them. The feds said Collins resisted agents — and injured one agent’s thumb. Collins told the Sun-Times he \"did not start\"&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the altercation and \"did not assault anyone.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors later sought to have the couple detained. U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Fuentes ruled that Robledo didn’t qualify&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for detention. Collins did, because of the agent’s injury, and Collins’ attorney insisted on an immediate hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge ordered Collins detained. He questioned Collins’ judgment in bringing a gun to an ICE protest, “particularly given ICE’s recent history of aggressive enforcement tactics while heavily armed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robledo said Collins, who is Black, was seemingly held in jail longer “simply because of the color of his skin.”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Collins said he suspects the judge “subconsciously” assumed “I carried and I was a dangerous individual because of my presentation in court, my looks, and the area that I’m from.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADy5XJc9b-Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"This Chicago couple fought charges brought by the Trump administration — and won\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his written order, Fuentes said the defense request for an immediate hearing left him without a report that might have addressed Collins’ employment and lack of criminal history, as well as his personal background. The decision “was an extremely close call,” the judge wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuentes predicted that a reviewing judge could take advantage of “a more fulsome record.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days later, U.S. District Judge Sunil Harjani&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;ordered Collins’ release with that additional information in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, on Oct. 8, the feds dropped the charges. A grand jury had refused to indict, in a rare rebuke of federal prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time spent in jail was “nerve-wracking,” Collins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not because I was scared that I was in federal prison,” he explained. “But just the stress of knowing that I can’t take care of my pets, my family. That the justice system does not work even when you haven’t done anything wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robledo has been hesitant to join protests in Broadview ever since. As someone who has been involved in demonstrations since the age of 13, Robledo said that’s “life changing”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;— but insisted it’s not “life ruining.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It makes it harder for you to do anything,” Robledo said of the prosecution. “That’s the point, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I decided a long time ago that that wasn’t going to happen to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuentes has since &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/20/unusual-and-possibly-unprecedented-judge-calls-out-chicago-feds-as-midway-blitz-cases-fall-apart\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;questioned some of the charges&lt;/a&gt; brought amid Operation Midway Blitz, including against Collins and Robledo. He did so in an opinion&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;issued in late November, after a series of cases before him&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge wrote that he’d “obtained sworn confirmation that video backed up”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the feds’ claims against Collins and Robledo. Still, he wrote, “the grand jury refused to find probable cause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is a sobering event for a magistrate judge,” Fuentes wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: “Any responsible federal prosecutor knows that federal charges, or any actions by the United States attorney directed at the citizenry, must be undertaken with the utmost care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘Levels of repression’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez has become the most prominent of the 17 cleared Midway Blitz defendants in Chicago. She testified recently &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/03/marimar-martinez-goes-to-washington-wants-trump-officials-to-admit-not-a-domestic-terrorist\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;before Democratic members of Congress&lt;/a&gt;.

The feds accused Espinoza Martinez, 37, of offering $10,000 for Bovino’s murder. Espinoza Martinez spent 109 days in jail — far more than any other Midway Blitz defendant who's been cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His prosecution revolved around a Snapchat message he sent to an acquaintance&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that purportedly offered $2,000 for Bovino’s capture and $10,000 for his head. Espinoza Martinez is a Mexican citizen and father who lived in Chicago for 30 years and has no criminal history, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told agents he didn’t mean for anyone to actually carry out the murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury found Espinoza Martinez not guilty on Jan. 22.

But Guataquira, 30, says it shows how people are being targeted by the feds “even at the most ‘minor’ level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 19 weeks, Guataquira faced a misdemeanor charge alleging she’d impeded a federal employee in Broadview. She told the Sun-Times she was accused of knocking a phone out of an agent’s hand Oct. 3, the day Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited the ICE facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors finally dropped the case against Guataquira on Feb. 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guataquira said she was held in custody for about six hours but never overnight. She said she’s since spent her days traveling and never had to attend court in person. She reported to the U.S. Marshals office over the holidays to be processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But authorities took her passport. She said that prevented her from visiting family in Mexico and otherwise crossing the border during her travels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to go to Vancouver Island when we were in Washington,” Guataquira said. “Could not do any of that. So that was, I think, one of the biggest things that bugged me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all amounts to “different levels of repression,” she said, “from the legal end of things to your livelihood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sullied reputations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levenson, the Loyola law professor, is also a former federal prosecutor. She said Trump’s second term brought significant change to the Justice Department, where top officials seem to be “using the power of prosecution for revenge and retribution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s about chilling demonstrators,\" Levenson said. “It’s about intimidation. It’s about flexing the federal muscle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even a misdemeanor case like Guataquira’s carries a threat of prison time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All you know is that the government’s being extremely aggressive,” Levenson said. “So you think of the worst.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"  data-align-floatRight&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-0c0000\" name=\"image-0c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c9fc4b3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/396x222+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F45%2Fb8%2F80bd500849ef927ce982f0843fed%2Flevenson-laurie-new-faculty-photo.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/770246d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/396x222+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F45%2Fb8%2F80bd500849ef927ce982f0843fed%2Flevenson-laurie-new-faculty-photo.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3b4f73/2147483647/strip/true/crop/396x222+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F45%2Fb8%2F80bd500849ef927ce982f0843fed%2Flevenson-laurie-new-faculty-photo.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A portrait of Laurie Levenson smiling and wearing a yellow blazer\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3b4f73/2147483647/strip/true/crop/396x222+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F45%2Fb8%2F80bd500849ef927ce982f0843fed%2Flevenson-laurie-new-faculty-photo.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9c6a8c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/396x222+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F45%2Fb8%2F80bd500849ef927ce982f0843fed%2Flevenson-laurie-new-faculty-photo.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3b4f73/2147483647/strip/true/crop/396x222+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F45%2Fb8%2F80bd500849ef927ce982f0843fed%2Flevenson-laurie-new-faculty-photo.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laurie Levenson, professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loyola Law School&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s limited legal recourse available to people caught up in failed federal prosecutions, she said.

They have a label that is put on them and it’s very hard to get that removed from the public psyche.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levenson said it could “take years to repair any trust in credibility in the Justice Department,” including within the judiciary, following so many failed prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What really troubles me,” Levenson said, “is there is real crime out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But if you’re busy spending your time, money, [and] energy on cases where, ultimately, they will be or should be dropped,” she said, “then you’re not protecting society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/tracker-federal-prosecutions-chicago-status-trumps-immigration-blitz-ice\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Tracking every known federal prosecution in Chicago tied to Trump’s immigration blitz&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/20/unusual-and-possibly-unprecedented-judge-calls-out-chicago-feds-as-midway-blitz-cases-fall-apart\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;‘Unusual and possibly unprecedented’: Judge calls out Chicago feds as Midway Blitz cases fall apart&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/03/marimar-martinez-shot-border-patrol-chicago-speaks-out-after-good-pretti-deaths-i-am-their-voice\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Marimar Martinez, shot by Border Patrol in Chicago, speaks out after Good, Pretti deaths: ‘I am their voice’&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Since we're on the south side of that system, it's going to be pulling in warm air northward, so we're kind of benefiting from our placement, but that's still going to drive a cold front through our area.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Weather whiplashes are pretty common this time of year, and that's just what can be taking place with the system,\" Borchardt added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a \"couple of chances for snow\" Saturday near the Wisconsin state line and Sunday night in the south suburbs, though the metro area may not see much snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It won't be slam dunks for everybody,\" Borchardt said of the snow probabilities. &lt;/p&gt;",

It’s been there since he stepped on the court as a freshman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He can’t get sped up,” Jaxson’s dad Brian Davis said. “He plays at his own pace. That’s his superpower that most people don’t have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis has a rare comfort level on the court for a 17-year-old, and it didn’t happen by chance. He spent thousands of hours of his childhood at Joy of the Game in Deerfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Davis worked as president of the large basketball facility and as a coach for the Rising Stars club team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no doubt that was very important,” Brian Davis said. “I was working there all the time, mornings to evenings. My wife went back to work and Jaxson lived at Joy of the Game, basically. He was at all my practices, watching the dream team with Jabari Parker and Tommy Hamilton.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family photos from Davis’s childhood show how basketball has always dominated his life. There’s a picture of Davis being held as a baby by Kobe Bryant. Derrick Rose and Jaxson when he was a toddler. A very young Jaxson with Jimmy Butler.

Three years old and throwing it up at a 10-foot rim. It just played a huge part in developing my skill set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember waking up early on Saturday and Sundays to watch the older guys play. Joy of the Game was a big spot where NBA guys would come in and work out. Seeing those people taught me a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis led Warren to the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2025/03/15/warren-benet-ihsa-state-championship\"   &gt;state championship game&lt;/a&gt; last year as a sophomore. His confidence, composure and basketball IQ elevated his above-average team into a state title contender the past two seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew when he was young that he had a chance to play after high school,” Brian Davis said. “He always played up multiple levels, and his IQ was off the charts. He saw things before other players did. That will always be there. But there are things he needs to get better at as far as shooting, taking contact and getting stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis made headlines with his &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2025/12/30/jaxson-davis-warren-basketball-big-dipper\"   &gt;51-point performance&lt;/a&gt; in the Big Dipper Holiday Tournament championship game in December and is on pace to become the all-time leading scorer in Lake County history and one of the top scorers in state history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That stuff is cool, but I really just want to win the state championship,” Davis said. “That’s my main goal overall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis has nearly 20 college scholarship offers, including most of the Big Ten. He’s widely considered a top 40 player in the national Class of 2027 and next year he will be the state’s best hope for a McDonald’s All-American in several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has always been a dream of mine to get an offer from a blue blood school,” Davis said. “I still have a lot of time left and they don’t usually get involved until around this spring. I think they will be sniffing around soon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-bf0000\" name=\"image-bf0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bbc6fa9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F5c%2Fb36fe7ab41478328571adec9daa2%2Fob-cst-022026-7057-crp.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9f8863/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F5c%2Fb36fe7ab41478328571adec9daa2%2Fob-cst-022026-7057-crp.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ce7014/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F5c%2Fb36fe7ab41478328571adec9daa2%2Fob-cst-022026-7057-crp.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Jaxson Davis handles the ball against DePaul Prep.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ce7014/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F5c%2Fb36fe7ab41478328571adec9daa2%2Fob-cst-022026-7057-crp.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2830ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F5c%2Fb36fe7ab41478328571adec9daa2%2Fob-cst-022026-7057-crp.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ce7014/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F5c%2Fb36fe7ab41478328571adec9daa2%2Fob-cst-022026-7057-crp.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaxson Davis handles the ball against DePaul Prep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many of the area’s high-profile basketball and football stars, Davis has not signed with an agent or focused on NIL yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That will all come,” Brian Davis said. “We have gotten plenty of phone calls from top agencies. We are just letting him play basketball and be a kid for now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Davis is a varsity assistant coach and the sophomore coach at Warren. Jaxson’s brother plays on the sophomore team, and there are usually 12 to 15 family members at Warren basketball games. The family is supremely focused on winning the state championship that the Blue Devils came so close to last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last year the title game against Benet was a roller coaster,” Davis said. “But we learned a lot. It is a huge challenge. Private schools are able to recruit. But we are right there. [This season] &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2026/01/24/benet-basketball-warren-when-sides-collide\"   &gt;we lost to Benet&lt;/a&gt; by seven and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2026/02/19/depaul-prep-basketball-warren\"   &gt;DePaul Prep&lt;/a&gt; by four and we shot the ball terrible from three in that game. We aren’t that far from where we need to be to win a state championship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of Davis’s best friends and the other best local players in the class of 2027, Davion Thompson and Devin Cleveland, left the state for prep schools last year. As of now, Davis plans to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have any reason to leave,” Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CHICAGO SUN-TIMES PLAYERS OF THE

That could make things slightly tougher for &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;the Bears&lt;/a&gt; as they try to navigate what already was going to be a tight cap crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The league set the cap at $301.2 million Friday, which is an increase of $22 million from last season and a staggering $76.4 million jump from where it stood in 2023. However, it was at the bottom end of the projected range the league gave teams a month ago when it said to plan for between $301.2 and $305.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few million dollars isn’t earth-shattering in this world, but for a team counting every penny like the Bears, it makes their offseason a bit more challenging. The final number means they’re now $6.4 million over the cap, which they need to fix by the start of the new league year March 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting themselves cap-compliant is relatively easy and will be more than solved &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/25/bears-linebacker-tremaine-edmunds-permission-seek-trade-nfl-cut-salary-cap-15-million\"   &gt;by the expected trade or release of linebacker Tremaine Edmunds&lt;/a&gt;, but the team will need to clear additional space to re-sign priority free agents like safety Kevin Byard, address significant holes in their starting lineup on both sides of the ball and pursue upgrades as they try to exceed what they did last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of their highest paid players have multiple years left on their contracts and don’t have an affordable out this offseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wide receiver DJ Moore, for example, is their most expensive player this season with a cap hit of $28.5 million and is just beginning the contract extension he signed in 2024. Moore is signed through 2029, and the dead-cap number doesn’t drop to a reasonable amount until after the 2027 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears likely will restructure or extend some veteran players to create space, but general manager Ryan Poles is resistant to kicking too much money down the road because, as the team experienced under predecessor Ryan Pace, that eventually leads to an untenable situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't know about like limited amount of restructures, but … there's philosophical things that we believe in, in terms of not getting to this place where we're kicking the can down the road on a bunch of guys, and then at some point you got to pay that bill. And you don't want that to be the reason why you're not flexible and able to do unique things or take advantage of opportunities with your roster.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's some things you can do — you all have seen that before I got here,” Poles said this week. “You can accelerate [roster building] and then after, it goes away pretty quick... Do you want to go all in and hurt yourself down the road? Our mindset is to do win now and then be able to sustain that and have flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's not going to be easy. We've been really good with dead money, [but] at some point that's going to go up because that's just the nature of playing this out over a long period of time and having tough decisions to make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teams with the most salary-cap space going into next season are the Titans ($94.9 million), Raiders ($89.2 million) and Jets ($88.8 million). The defending champion Seahawks are sixth at $59.6 million, and the Patriots, who lost to them in the Super Bowl, are 10th with $40.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;",

Jackson is limited, but she says that “it’s her duty to be here with everyone else in the community, and I’m proud to be part of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spikener, 24, attended day two of a public service for Reverend Jackson as he lay in repose. She was among hundreds that lined up along Drexel Blvd. from 50th street to 49th street Friday outside Rainbow Push’s headquarters in Kenwood to pay their respects to Jackson, who died Feb. 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/26/rev-jesse-jackson-lying-in-repose-rainbow-push-chicago\"   &gt;Thurday’s service which drew thousands of people&lt;/a&gt;, photos and videos of notable moments in Rev. Jackson's life played on a screen at the front of the line. His \"I am somebody\" speech and gospel music blared from loudspeakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her early education growing up in Naperville, Spikener said she learned about the Civil Rights Movement, though it was mostly focused on Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spikener said that she’s here to “support a legacy that’s been going on throughout the years, way before I was born.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She believes that Rev. Jackson’s death may be a catalyst for young people to learn more about their history, have a stronger presence in their communities, and lean towards self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This may be a moment to realize that maybe we need to do more for ourselves, and do more for our community like he has, and just start somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spikener said it's important to begin early, “whether it’s volunteering, doing side missions, or work, starting in churches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xavier Myles, 12, came from Flossmoor, IL with his dad to attend today' s services. He knows that without the sacrifices of Rev. Jackson, he might have attended segregated schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It helps me go to public schools today and I’m in the classroom with white people. I feel proud that we’re not separated like they used to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Myles, 31, said Jackson’s enduring legacy will be that he was a champion for all people. She thinks that message is especially important in today’s fraught political moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are a a lot of evils and their main agenda is to try to divide us and I think he was very much about trying to bring everyone together for the greater good,” Myles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myles’ mother Lisa Myles grew up attending Rainbow PUSH coalition’s Saturday morning events. Tyler attended events there, too. Today’s advocates can learn a thing from Jackson’s approach to coalition building and spend more time within communities, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whats different about our time is that I think sometimes with social media and media in general people think that the performative major actions are what drive most of the change,\" Tyler said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added: \"He was out there in communities and for me it's about realizing the struggle is a day to day thing and being out there speaking to your neighbors, getting to know people that live on your block, speaking to the people that are at the grocery store.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c20000\" name=\"image-c20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b95ca2c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F75%2F596ec2624e53987440ea6be6b399%2F561a1549.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/093cf0c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F75%2F596ec2624e53987440ea6be6b399%2F561a1549.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/240f2c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F75%2F596ec2624e53987440ea6be6b399%2F561a1549.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Tyler family waiting in line for Jackson&amp;#x27;s public viewing\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/240f2c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F75%2F596ec2624e53987440ea6be6b399%2F561a1549.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9f8f3ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F75%2F596ec2624e53987440ea6be6b399%2F561a1549.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/240f2c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F75%2F596ec2624e53987440ea6be6b399%2F561a1549.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tyler family waits in line to view Rev.

While it’s visible from the street, the mural is best enjoyed from a table outside — in weather warmer than a typical Chicago winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"  data-align-fullBleed&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-e40000\" name=\"image-e40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1a06394/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5643x3167+1274+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faa%2F7c%2F7e13b4fe41d6831d05426c88bb64%2Fmurals-ramova-2603010104-2.jpeg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e278d2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5643x3167+1274+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faa%2F7c%2F7e13b4fe41d6831d05426c88bb64%2Fmurals-ramova-2603010104-2.jpeg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b443680/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5643x3167+1274+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faa%2F7c%2F7e13b4fe41d6831d05426c88bb64%2Fmurals-ramova-2603010104-2.jpeg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The murals were completed during a painting party one night last summer.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b443680/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5643x3167+1274+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faa%2F7c%2F7e13b4fe41d6831d05426c88bb64%2Fmurals-ramova-2603010104-2.jpeg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/30644c0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5643x3167+1274+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faa%2F7c%2F7e13b4fe41d6831d05426c88bb64%2Fmurals-ramova-2603010104-2.jpeg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b443680/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5643x3167+1274+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faa%2F7c%2F7e13b4fe41d6831d05426c88bb64%2Fmurals-ramova-2603010104-2.jpeg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The murals were completed during a painting party one night last summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manuel Martinez/WBEZ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a really good representation of who we are visually,” Nevius says, with “different voices coming together and creating something unique and special and filling a space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Won Kim and Perez, those voices include artists who go by the names Cujo Dah, Underseagravy, Elloo, Chucho, Joey D, ZorZorZor and Kuaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perez, who goes by the artist name CZR PRZ, says he reached out to artists he knew would help build on the vibe that's happening at Ramova Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those kinds of spaces are what help build community,” he says. “I felt they would be a good fit for what’s going on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cujo Dah, whose real name is Joe Nelson, is cofounder of Englewood Art’s Collective and a longtime muralist. Perez and Kim invited him, and “if they call me, I’m coming,” he says. His addition included some sketches by his 7-year-old son, as well as an abstract interpretation of his child’s drum machine.

He painted his contribution in his graffiti-letter style. It reads, “Welcome to the South Side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a former North Sider, I’m discovering the South Side for what it is,” Kim says. As an artist, “the best walls are on the South Side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alejandro Martell, who goes by the artist name Underseagravy, says he wasn’t planning to paint that night when he showed up for the event.

It started in the first minute, when he claimed that: \"When I spoke in this chamber 12 months ago, I had just inherited a nation in crisis, with a stagnant economy, inflation at record levels, a wide-open border, horrendous recruitment for military and police, rampant crime at home and wars and chaos all over the world.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of that is truthful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic growth was actually a bit better during Joe Biden's final year in office (2.8%) than in Trump's first year (2.2%). In March of last year, inflation was not at \"record levels\"; it was 2.8% (in terms of percent change over the previous 12 months). Yes, it had surged to 9.1% in 2022, but it had been trending down since then. Nor was that 9.1% \"the worst inflation in the history of our country,\" as Trump knows perfectly well, because he lived through the 1970s and '80s, when inflation reached 13.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a rise in encounters at the border under Biden, but the actual number of entries — both among those released into the United States and \"got aways\" — is estimated to have been about 4.2 million. That's 4.2 million, not the 20 million this administration constantly claims. Nor is there a shred of evidence that other nations were dumping their criminal and mentally ill populations at our borders. Nor is it the case that immigrants commit more crime than native born Americans. It's the opposite. No, other nations have not committed to invest \"$18 trillion\" in the U.S., nor do foreigners pay American tariffs, nor will tariffs replace the income tax. Here's when you start digging your fingernails into your palms. It's fact-check purgatory. Still, as contemptible as the compulsive lying is, the State of the Union highlighted another deformation of our republic that has reached its apotheosis in Trump: the assumption of presidential supremacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-640000\" name=\"module-640000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take even the format of the speech itself. The president stands physically above the members of Congress, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the justices of the Supreme Court. This isn't usually a problem when presidents are not maniacal narcissists. But now it feeds the pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few take note of the fact that the president is the invited guest of the Congress, not the other way around. The Constitution requires that the president \"shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\" It doesn't require that he do so annually, nor does it require a live speech. Presidents starting with Thomas Jefferson sent their messages in writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woodrow Wilson reverted to the George Washington/John Adams tradition of a spoken, in-person address. Calvin Coolidge was the first president to broadcast his. Congress has the power to insist upon the Jeffersonian practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often refer to \"co-equal\" branches of government. That's not right. Though you wouldn't know it to watch its invertebrate current members, Congress is the preeminent branch — that's why it is established in Article I of the Constitution. Congress is granted the lion's share of federal authority, and it has more power over the other branches than they have over it. The president's only check on Congress is the veto, which can be overridden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Congress can impeach and remove the president (and judges), confirm or reject executive and judicial appointees, strip courts of jurisdiction or even disestablish them, coin money, levy taxes and tariffs (as the Supreme Court recently reminded us), restructure or eliminate executive agencies, and most saliently, fund or defund the entire government. As James Madison put it in Federalist No. 51: \"In republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As everyone knows, Congress has been ceding its power to the executive for decades. This suited members' interest in that it allowed them to avoid having to explain tough votes to their constituents. Now that the presidency is in the hands of a political arsonist, perhaps even these lawmakers can perceive where their cowardice has led.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's true that presidents have flexed their war-making muscles on many occasions, successfully bypassing congressional power. But presidential assertions of dominance have only been possible when Congress emasculates itself. It will take time for members to recover their self-respect. A few have introduced war powers resolutions, but the overall tone regarding Trump's possible plans for Iran remains tentative, almost pleading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said, \"Look, this is serious, and the administration has to make its case to the American people.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries observed, reasonably enough, that he couldn't understand the urgency regarding Iran's nuclear program, since the administration claimed in June that it had \"obliterated\" the threat. But he offered only that \"the American people deserve an explanation.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State of the Union addresses have long since devolved into kabuki theater with members bobbing in and out of their seats like Whac-A-Mole. But under Trump, they've become clown shows — and though Trump himself is chief clown, the members too have been smeared in greasepaint. Until they can reclaim their dignity, the show should be put on hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mona Charen is policy editor of The Bulwark and host of the “Beg to Differ” podcast.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-000000\" name=\"module-000000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

It embraces fun, sometimes oddball pairings like funky orange wine with stinky cheese, or blind tastings with a \"Heated Rivalry\" theme&amp;nbsp;in reference to the buzzy HBO series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wine industry may be struggling, but in Chicago, in-store wine education is alive and evolving beyond lessons rooted in the historic powerhouse regions found in California, France and Spain. There’s a flourishing menu of classes representing viniculture from Baja and Hungary — and they are quickly finding an audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We’ve done, gosh, I don’t know, hundreds, maybe over a thousand events?

It increases local unemployment with no economic benefits to the area's economy [that] I can discern. It just seems like a way for big tech companies to funnel money out of Chicago and into their pockets.\" — &lt;i&gt;Mike McMains&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I am fine with it, but I want them to show why the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjiyuyd-l-ii/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;disaster that occurred during the power outage in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;won't happen here. Strangely enough, I was driving across SF during that power outage. Every intersection had a dead Waymo square in the middle of each intersection, screwing up traffic wildly.\" — &lt;i&gt;Austin Schraudenbach&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Why would we want self-driving cars here? If we want to make the roads safer, we can lower speed limits and reengineer our roads to be friendlier to bikes and pedestrians. If we want to prevent drunk driving, a robot cab won't be cheaper than Uber, Lyft or an old-fashioned taxicab. If we want to improve congestion, we can invest more in transit ... Waymo sounds like a solution looking for a problem.\" — &lt;i&gt;Benjamin Recchie&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Generally, I'm not in favor of anything that takes away jobs from real people just to enrich shareholders and CEOs who would never dream of driving a cab or driving for a rideshare service, and are pretending they're altruists who care about drunk driving and people with epilepsy. The most equitable, environmentally friendly way to prevent drunk driving is to invest in public transit, but that doesn't make Waymo any money.\" — &lt;i&gt;Jordan Mainzer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"As a bicyclist and pedestrian, I rely on interacting with [a] driver to confirm that they see me and to agree on who will proceed. &amp;nbsp;Until the robocar can communicate with pedestrians and cyclists, I don't want them.\" — &lt;i&gt;Joseph Schuman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I fear that they will not do well in the winter, when curbs and lane stripes are difficult or impossible to see. Also, breaking conditions are difficult and extremely variable in the winter. And I wonder if they are programmable for Lake Effect snow.\" — &lt;i&gt;Thomas Medina&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"As we continue to take jobs away from people who rely on [work] as taxi drivers or Uber drivers, I can’t help but wonder: At what cost? Does it make our cities better? Do autonomous vehicles make our streets safer? We see the data, and we still think this is a good idea. But I want to be around the first time one of those driverless cars finds itself on Lower Wacker. Good luck with that!\" — &lt;i&gt;Shimmy Miller&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading the Sun-Times&amp;nbsp;Morning Edition!&lt;br&gt;Got a story you think we missed?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:newsletters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Email us here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written and curated by&lt;/b&gt;: Matt Moore&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor&lt;/b&gt;: Eydie Cubarrubia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Chicago Sun-Times is a nonprofit supported by&amp;nbsp;readers like you.

Horse owners, trainers and breeders have gone unpaid since August, with more than 65 horse owners showing at least $580,000 in bounced checks from Hawthorne since then, according to the Illinois Harness Horsemen’s Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a difficult day for Hawthorne and for my family which has owned Hawthorne for four generations over 117 years, but filing for reorganization is the right thing to do for the Illinois horsemen and for our employees and their families,” said Tim Carey, president and CEO of Hawthorne Race Course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reorganization plan intends to preserve 250 track workers’ jobs and it will prioritize paying the accrued purses to horse owners, the race course said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Harness Horsemen's Association, which represents harness racers, owners, trainers and breeders, said it learned late Friday morning of Hawthorne's bankruptcy filing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We still do not have all of the details but expect to be in court early next week. We will release more information as soon as possible,\" the IHHA said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois’ gambling expansion law that passed in 2019 allowed Hawthorne Race Course to add casino games to help boost the flailing horse racing industry. But the race course has struggled to secure financing to ramp up its racino since then, putting the track in a financial crisis. Hawthorne is one of two horse race tracks left in Illinois, the other being in downstate Collinsville. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state law also gave Hawthorne power to veto any potential new track within 35 miles of its site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Debtors have faced substantial financial hardship in recent years,” Carey said, “driven by challenges affecting the horse racing industry in Illinois, initially due to the expansion of casino gaming and later compounded by an increasingly competitive sports betting market, as well as other industry-wide issues, including rising costs and increased regulatory fees related to simultaneously running a troubled business and building a new business.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last month’s Illinois Racing Board meeting, Hawthorne general manager John Walsh said the track had been working with a new financial partner and said they would “have something in place” within a month from then that would have had the track ready for thoroughbred racing in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoroughbred racing was scheduled to begin March 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The racing board had already canceled Jan. 3 and 4 harness races at the track for Hawthorne’s failure to submit required surety bonds. Other harness races in February were also canceled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carey said the bankruptcy filing became necessary after Hawthorne’s relationship with its lender and other creditors deteriorated. Other setbacks included Hawthorne’s sports wagering partner canceling its online and mobile sports betting and the discontinuation of some simulcast wagering at horse tracks across the country that resulted in judgments against debtors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hawthorne is working with the financial advisor Getzler Henrich &amp;amp; Associates to request a federal court approval of debtor-in-possession financing to fund its restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy declaration indicates a “substantial interest” from buyers and recapitalization partners in Hawthorne’s opportunity to build out its racino, the race course said.&lt;/p&gt;",

Es el sexto año consecutivo en el que el distrito inicia las clases antes del Día del Trabajo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El distrito presentó los calendarios el mes pasado en una reunión de la junta de las Escuelas Públicas de Chicago (CPS), pero buscó más comentarios de los miembros de la comunidad después de que los miembros de la junta plantearan preguntas sobre la programación alrededor de las vacaciones de invierno y el final del segundo trimestre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-de0000\" name=\"module-de0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;El segundo trimestre académico termina después de las vacaciones de invierno, el 22 de enero de 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los miembros de la junta estaban preocupados porque los estudiantes, especialmente los de secundaria, no podrían relajarse y desconectar durante sus vacaciones porque estarían preocupados por regresar para las pruebas de fin de trimestre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En respuesta, el distrito abrió una encuesta del 21 al 27 de enero para preguntarles a los miembros de la comunidad que eligieran entre tres opciones de calendario: la recomendada por el distrito y dos que habrían comenzado las clases antes en agosto para completar el segundo trimestre antes de las vacaciones de invierno.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicole Milberg, jefa de enseñanza y aprendizaje de CPS, presentó los resultados en una reunión de la junta a principios de este mes. Más de 22,000 personas respondieron, y el 55% prefirió el horario original recomendado por el distrito, dijo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milberg reconoció en esa reunión que no todos estarán satisfechos con el horario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No hay un calendario perfecto, no importa cuántas veces volvamos a la mesa de trabajo. Nunca habrá un calendario que satisfaga las preferencias de todos los interesados”, dijo Milberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El horario permite que los estudiantes &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/01/12/chicago-public-schools-releases-2026-2027-calendar-with-longer-summer-break\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;disfruten su número típico de días de vacaciones de verano&lt;/a&gt; después del receso de sólo 67 días del año pasado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El último día del año escolar actual es el 4 de junio, lo que resulta en 81 días de vacaciones antes de que las clases comiencen de nuevo a finales de agosto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Las clases comenzaron más tarde en el año escolar 2024-2025 debido a la &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2024/2/1/24058117/cps-calendar-2024-25-school-year-dnc-push-back-date\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Convención Nacional Demócrata&lt;/a&gt; (DNC), lo que resultó en un receso más corto. En el verano de 2024, los estudiantes también tuvieron 81 días de receso.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Para el año escolar 2026-2027, los estudiantes continuarán teniendo una semana libre por el receso del Día de Acción de Gracias, así como un día libre para las elecciones de medio término del Congreso el 3 de noviembre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Las vacaciones de invierno están programadas del 21 de diciembre al 1 de enero de 2027, mientras que el receso de primavera será del 22 al 26 de marzo de 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-fa410a\" name=\"image-fa410a\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24616e4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/813x456+0+56/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F15%2Fd9edf7724613b62ec0e91bce8ef9%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-26-142544.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/71a3f81/2147483647/strip/true/crop/813x456+0+56/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F15%2Fd9edf7724613b62ec0e91bce8ef9%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-26-142544.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7e20405/2147483647/strip/true/crop/813x456+0+56/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F15%2Fd9edf7724613b62ec0e91bce8ef9%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-26-142544.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"El calendario de las Escuelas Públicas de Chicago para el año académico 2026-27.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7e20405/2147483647/strip/true/crop/813x456+0+56/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F15%2Fd9edf7724613b62ec0e91bce8ef9%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-26-142544.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d294b61/2147483647/strip/true/crop/813x456+0+56/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F15%2Fd9edf7724613b62ec0e91bce8ef9%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-26-142544.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7e20405/2147483647/strip/true/crop/813x456+0+56/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F15%2Fd9edf7724613b62ec0e91bce8ef9%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-26-142544.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;El calendario de las Escuelas Públicas de Chicago para el año académico 2026-27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;El inicio del año escolar 2027-2028 está previsto para el 23 de agosto de 2027, y el último día será el 9 de junio de 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cada uno de los calendarios recién aprobados suma 176 días de asistencia estudiantil, con 14 días sin asistencia estudiantil para formación del personal, trabajo de mejora escolar y conferencias de padres y maestros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Arichely es una de aproximadamente 545 estudiantes que asisten a dos escuelas secundarias administradas por la financieramente afectada red de escuelas chárter Aspira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Más del 90% de los estudiantes en estas dos escuelas son latinos, más de dos tercios provienen de familias de bajos ingresos y más de la mitad son estudiantes del idioma inglés.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-d10000\" name=\"module-d10000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Después de meses de idas y venidas, los funcionarios de las Escuelas Públicas de Chicago (CPS) le están diciendo a los estudiantes que la red no tiene el dinero para llegar al final del año escolar y que deben transferirse antes del inicio del último trimestre “para proteger la estabilidad de su educación”. Si bien hay debate sobre si la culpa es de las CPS o de Aspira, un cierre escolar a mitad de año es prácticamente inaudito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely, al igual que otros estudiantes, tiene una larga lista de preocupaciones y preguntas sobre créditos, calificaciones, eventos de último año y graduación. Pero también tiene una preocupación más emocional. Vive lejos de su actual escuela, la Aspira Business and Finance Academy en el vecindario de Avondale, y, si la envían a la escuela de su vecindario, no cree que a muchos de sus amigos les toque ir allí.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Se describe a sí misma como tímida y se pregunta cómo será entrar a una nueva escuela cuando ya se ha avanzado tres cuartas partes del año.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creo que mi mayor problema es que voy a tener que presentarme a personas que no conozco”, dijo. “Ahora estaré completamente sola, y no tendré a la gente con la que estoy acostumbrada”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-9cb187\" name=\"image-9cb187\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de9ca2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+50/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fdc%2Febd3caf449508a44aa54b742e089%2Faspiraclosing-260227-16.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9cff274/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+50/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fdc%2Febd3caf449508a44aa54b742e089%2Faspiraclosing-260227-16.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff9e03c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+50/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fdc%2Febd3caf449508a44aa54b742e089%2Faspiraclosing-260227-16.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Un letrero de próximos eventos en peligro cuelga en la puerta del salón de José Torres en la secundaria ASPIRA Business &amp;amp; Finance, ubicada en 2989 N.

En la reunión del jueves de la Junta de Educación de Chicago, los funcionarios de CPS se dirigieron a los estudiantes antes de explicar su decisión.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Este no es el resultado que nadie esperaba”, dijo Zabrina Evans, directora ejecutiva de Innovación e Incubación de CPS. “Entendemos el estrés y la dificultad de las noticias de hoy. Entendemos la incertidumbre y la interrupción que conlleva cambiar de escuela a mitad del año escolar actual”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans luego explicó que llegar a este punto ha sido “largo y complicado”, pero que, esencialmente, Aspira, al igual que todas las organizaciones chárter, acordó operar una escuela con el dinero proporcionado por CPS y que Aspira no ha podido hacerlo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CPS proporciona financiamiento y apoyo, y los operadores chárter ofrecen servicios educativos a los estudiantes”, destacó. No sólo Aspira ha sido incapaz de demostrar al distrito escolar que puede proporcionar esos servicios educativos hasta junio, sino que, además, el operador chárter no ha logrado entregar una auditoría y otros documentos financieros requeridos, agregó.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;También señaló que CPS le ha dado a Aspira $2.25 millones en adelantos en efectivo y, sin embargo, la red aún dice que necesita millones más para pagar a los maestros y al personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS está “avanzando con este proceso de transición estudiantil... debido a la grave situación creada por la incapacidad de Aspira de demostrar estabilidad financiera, lo cual pone en riesgo la educación de los estudiantes de Aspira”, dijo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hasta la noche del miércoles, el director ejecutivo de Aspira, Edgar López, parecía esperanzado de que podía salvar las escuelas. Les dijo a CPS que se estaba reuniendo con un banco para obtener un préstamo puente y que estaba considerando recaudar fondos, incluso una campaña de financiamiento colectivo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero hablando en la reunión de la junta, López culpó a CPS por los problemas financieros de las escuelas chárter. Dijo que las chárter obtienen el 83% de lo que reciben las escuelas de CPS administradas por el distrito, aunque los funcionarios del distrito escolar refutan esa cifra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Siento que las escuelas chárter son los hijastros de CPS”, dijo. “Nuestras familias pagan impuestos igual que todas las demás familias”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;López también ha acusado a CPS de debilitar las escuelas chárter a través de su proceso de solicitud para las escuelas secundarias, priorizando enviar a los estudiantes a las escuelas administradas por el distrito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-8b7475\" name=\"image-8b7475\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7e0a4fd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/67074ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c0354c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"El director ejecutivo de Aspira, Edgar López, habló con estudiantes de la escuela secundaria Aspira Business &amp;amp; Finance el miércoles.

Este año, las escuelas secundarias de Aspira comenzaron con menos de 600 estudiantes, unos 200 menos que hace cinco años.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los operadores de escuelas chárter también citan otros problemas que han añadido a sus problemas financieros, incluidos los crecientes costos laborales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;López le dijo a la junta que no se encontrarán “irregularidades” en las finanzas de Aspira y que ha tenido auditorías limpias, pero la del año pasado aún no está completa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hizo un llamado a la junta para mantener la escuela intacta, incluso si eliminan a la administración de Aspira, al menos hasta el final del año escolar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Si esto es por los niños, entonces preocúpense por los niños”, dijo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Deberíamos estar celebrando nuestro futuro’ &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely y docenas de otros estudiantes y maestros asistieron a la reunión del jueves. Algunos de ellos atribuyeron la culpa a Aspira y a López, mientras que otros dijeron que CPS es responsable y debería hacer más.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero más que nada, lamentaron el hecho de que estaban atrapados en el medio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Walsh, quien enseña matemáticas en la Business &amp;amp; Finance Academy, citó un estudio que mostró que los estudiantes tienen más probabilidades de abandonar la escuela, enfrentar violencia y sufrir de depresión después de un cierre escolar a mitad de año.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dijo que los maestros como él encontrarán la manera de salir adelante, pero están preocupados por los estudiantes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Necesitamos garantías de que se cuidará a los estudiantes y que enfrentarán la menor fractura posible”, agregó. “CPS necesita darles la dignidad de un plan de acción que no repita la historia. Esta es su responsabilidad, a menos que estén resignados a convertirlos en otra estadística”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los estudiantes expresaron frustración, pero también querían saber qué pasaría después.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El estudiante de último año, Lavelle Turner, dijo que estaba ansioso por su última temporada jugando en el equipo de béisbol de Aspira y preparándose para hacer exámenes para ver si podía obtener créditos universitarios por clases de colocación avanzada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quería saber si incluso podría jugar béisbol y completar sus clases de colocación avanzada. “No deberíamos tener que pagar y sacrificar nuestro futuro”, dijo. “Deberíamos estar celebrando nuestro futuro”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-9f2faa\" name=\"image-9f2faa\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bc43a45/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f916013/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70fff7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Los estudiantes de la escuela chárter Aspira hablan durante una reunión de la junta escolar el jueves en las Escuelas Públicas de Chicago.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70fff7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9de36e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70fff7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los estudiantes de la escuela chárter Aspira hablan durante una reunión de la junta escolar el jueves en las Escuelas Públicas de Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talia Sprague/Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely está en camino de ir a la Universidad Loyola.

Comentó que estas escuelas tendrán un coordinador de transición designado que se comunicará con los estudiantes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;También se les ofrecerán “servicios integrales adaptados a las necesidades de los estudiantes, incluyendo mentoría, tutoría, servicios de salud mental y más”, les dijo a los miembros de la junta. “También estarán preparados para proporcionar artículos adicionales como tecnología, uniformes y materiales escolares que los estudiantes puedan necesitar para tener éxito en la escuela”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los estudiantes recibirán tarjetas de autobús de CPS para llegar de manera segura a la escuela y regresar a casa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El distrito se asegurará de que los créditos se transfieran y de que los estudiantes puedan completar las clases, dijo. Se les dará a los estudiantes una carta para enviar a las universidades explicando la transferencia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Zaccor, miembro de la junta escolar que representa el lado norte, dijo que quiere asegurarse de que los estudiantes puedan participar en los equipos deportivos de primavera. También instruyó a los funcionarios de CPS a considerar la organización de eventos para los estudiantes de último año, como el baile de graduación y la graduación, exclusivamente para estudiantes de Aspira, incluso si ya no están juntos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creo que necesitamos pensar de manera creativa y asegurarnos de que esas cosas ocurran”, agregó.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debby Pope, quien representa a otro distrito del lado norte, calificó la situación como una “experiencia terrible” e “injusta”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero dijo que espera que esto envíe una advertencia a otras chárter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tienen que comportarse de manera responsable”, dijo. “Tienen que tener sus finanzas en orden. Tienen que ser transparentes. Tienen que entregar sus auditorías. No podemos hacerle esto a nuestros hijos. Simplemente no está bien”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

He’s the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, a freshly crowned national champion and a sure bet to be the top pick in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a reminder to the Bears that they’re far from unique in their aspirations. They’re chasing the established teams, of course, but even as they strive in their rebuild, plenty of competitors are, too. Every year, another team is angling to overtake them in the race to the top, and new quarterbacks will take their shot at surpassing Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Titans’ Cam Ward, Giants’ Jaxson Dart and Saints’ Tyler Shough hit the NFL as promising rookies last season, and the latter two already are off to solid starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it’s Mendoza’s chance, although he played it humbly Friday at the NFL Scouting Combine by saying he’d be grateful to picked at all, “whether it’s the No. 1 pick or the 199&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; pick,” which was quite different from Williams saying with certainty he’d be the first pick whether it was to the Bears or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mendoza is the consensus best quarterback, and the top three teams in the draft — Raiders, Jets, Cardinals — need one. He completed 72% of his passes last season, averaged 220.9 yards per game, led the country with 41 touchdown passes and threw just six interceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Right now I’m unemployed,” he said with a huge smile. “This is my job interview. I’m just trying to do everything to hopefully get employed April 23.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conversation will get more serious soon. Like Williams, Mendoza will enter the league with the burden of enormous expectations. The wayward Raiders are banking on him to lift them from years of struggling, and part-owner Tom Brady figures to be instrumental in his development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady is intent on building the Raiders into a winner and was widely seen as the Bears’ top competition to recruit coach Ben Johnson last year. It says a lot if he signs off on Mendoza, and his influence could be just as impactful as Johnson’s has been on Williams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To be mentored by him would mean so much,” said Mendoza, who spoke with Brady via phone during his meeting with the Raiders’ delegation at the combine. “I’ve got to learn a lot. It’s a long journey and to have a mentor like that would be pretty impressive and meaningful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears likely won’t see Mendoza until the 2027 season when they’re slated to play the Raiders in Las Vegas, so he’ll be well into his development by that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and Williams have faced each other before, actually, as Mendoza mentioned Friday the “tough defeat” in 2023 when he was at Cal and Williams was at USC. Williams threw for 369 yards and two touchdowns to win 50-49 as Mendoza’s pass for a two-point conversion in the final minute was incomplete. Mendoza threw for 292 yards and two touchdowns as a red-shirt freshman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Mendoza elevates the Raiders, they’ll become one more obstacle for the Bears in the harsh ecosystem of the NFL, a zero-sum game in which one team’s gains always come at the expense of another. It’s never as simple as merely finding solutions to your own problems; those solutions have to be better than other teams’ solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The competition never stops as Williams is trying to prove he’s a top-10 quarterback next season and earn a landmark contract extension to solidify himself as the Bears’ centerpiece. He was better last season under Johnson than he was as a rookie, but his next step needs to be bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was top-seven in yards (3,942), touchdown passes (27) and fewest interceptions by percentage (1.2% of his passes), but also finished 22nd in passer rating (90.1) and last in completion percentage (58.1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s work to do there, and he has to improve better and faster than his peers. He’s trying to catch up to the great quarterbacks, but he also has to stay ahead of others from his own draft class and upstarts like Mendoza.&lt;/p&gt;",

The current combined city, county and state tax on hotel rooms is 17.5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The voice vote on the measure, which now goes to the full City Council for final approval, was enthusiastic and nearly unanimous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ald. Brian Hopkins (2nd) led the charge for what he called an “easy yes vote,” noting that hotels in all or part of fourteen different wards — including downtown, McCormick Place, the Illinois Medical District and Hyde Park — have volunteered to impose the 1.5 percentage point increase for the next five years. After that, the district would need to be renewed by an oversight board of hotel operators and the City Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anyone who has participated in the budget process for the past couple years can’t help but notice how rare and uncommon it is for any sector of our Chicago economy to raise their hand and say, `Please tax me more.’ I can’t think of another example,” Hopkins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finance Chair Pat Dowell (3rd) said she’s convinced the tourism district and the $40 million in annual revenue it generates will “benefit Chicago greatly.” But her yes vote came with a demand for spending specifics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m looking for more information on how you’re going to promote, for example, historic preservation tourism in places like Bronzeville or the Prairie District or Chinatown,” Dowell said. “How are you going to interact with the designated state cultural districts all over the city? How you’re going to support things like the Bud Billiken Day parade and other parades?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Side Ald. David Moore (17th) cast the only no vote to protest the fact that the 1.5 percentage point increase would also be paid by Chicago residents who can’t afford to leave town and might want to treat themselves to a “staycation\" by taking a Chicago hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m concerned about how this will impact people living in this city and may want to enjoy this city,” Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase would apply to room rates at hotels with 100 or more rooms that opt in — and are within a designated area of the Greater Central Business District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tax increase is expected to generate  $269 million over the next five years. That would double the existing marketing budget for  Choose Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue would be used to market the city, bankroll incentives and cover bid fees, such as the $1 million required to enter the competition to host the Democratic National Convention. It would level a marketing playing field now tilted in favor of Chicago’s hard-charging convention and tourism competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority has an annual operating budget of $457 million, according to a comparison prepared by Choose Chicago. That’s followed by Visit Orlando ($116 million), Discover Los Angeles ($62 million), the San Diego Tourism Authority ($56.9 million) and New York’s NYC &amp;amp; Company ($45 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our competitors know very well that Chicago is underfunded, and they use it to their advantage not only to attract the same conventions, visitors and events that we’re trying to attract to Chicago, but to lure away our legacy clients that have been coming to Chicago for decades,” Choose Chicago CEO Kristen Reynolds told the Finance Committee. \"Our competitors benefit from the negative narratives surrounding our city that we can’t afford to counteract, and they offer lucrative incentives that they know we can’t match.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 200 cities have created tourism entertainment districts since San Diego blazed the trail 25 years ago. Chicago is one of the last major convention cities to embrace the idea and needs to do so after a difficult year that included the federal deportation campaign known as “Operation Midway Blitz.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The narrative around our city that was around the globe  [showed] tear gas. It scared a lot of people [who] wanted to come to our city,” Reynolds said Friday. “We were writing talking points and talking to every single convention that was worried about their attendees coming, reminding them that this is a safe city, that this is a wonderful city.”&lt;/p&gt;",

He started his high school career at Marist before transferring to IMG Academy in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Growing up in Chicago was great,” Tate said Friday the NFL Scouting Combine. “It’s a tough city, so you had to learn how to fight. That’s all my life, what I’ve been doing, is fighting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with intel from the Combine, here’s the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/12/bears-nfl-mock-draft-pick-25-overall-fernando-mendoza-tj-parker-indiana-clemson-april\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Sun-Times’ Mock Draft 2.0 &lt;/a&gt;—&amp;nbsp;featuring the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Bears’&lt;/a&gt; pick at No. 25: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Raiders — Indiana QB Fernando Mendoza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At their Combine meeting, Mendoza was taught one play by head coach Klint Kubiak, complete with progressions and problem-solving tips — and then made Mendoza teach it back to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Jets — Texas Tech EDGE David Bailey&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agreeing to trade Jermaine Johnson to the Titans locks the Jets in at edge rusher here. Bailey helped his cause this week with a 4.5-second 40-yard dash and a 35-inch vertical leap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Cardinals — Utah T Spencer Fano&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cardinals could be the worst team in football next year, which would give them a crack at drafting a franchise quarterback in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Titans — Miami EDGE Rueben Bain Jr.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding Johnson doesn’t eliminate the need for another defensive end. With Robert Saleh as head coach, the Jets once picked a first-round edge rusher in consecutive years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Giants — Miami T Francis Mauigoa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mauigoa will try to ensure that new coach John Harbaugh runs the ball as efficiently at his new job as he did with the Ravens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Browns — Ohio State WR Carnell Tate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tate said one benefit of joining the team would be the short drive back to Columbus to meet up with old friends and teammates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"113\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DIu0dOR5RBg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"Have a day, Carnell Tate\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Commanders — Ohio State EDGE Vell Reese&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reese had an eventful week, saying he was an edge rusher and not an inside linebacker — he played both at OSU —&amp;nbsp;and announcing he’d go by Vell instead of Arvell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Saints — Arizona State WR Jordyn Tyson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Saints’ second-leading wide receiver last year had 293 receiving yards. The Bears, by contrast, had four wideouts with more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. Chiefs — Notre Dame RB Jeremiyah Love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NFL Network draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah could see the Chiefs trading down unless Love, “the second-best player in the draft,” is available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Bengals — Ohio State S Caleb Downs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After posting one of the worst defensive seasons in NFL history, the Bengals get the draft’s surest thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. Dolphins — Tennessee CB Jermod McCoy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dolphins hold five of the first 90 picks and still could look to trade down. McCoy fills one of many needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Cowboys — Auburn EDGE Keldric Faulk&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Devoting a first-round pick to edge rusher after trading Micah Parsons to the Packers makes a kind of only-in-Dallas sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. Rams (via Falcons) — USC WR Makai Lemon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’d thrive in a receiver room alongside the great Puka Nacua and Davante Adams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. Ravens — Miami EDGE Akheem Mesidor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mesidor’s motor and production makes him feel like a Raven. He turns 25 before Week 1, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. Buccaneers — Ohio State LB Sonny Styles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Styles was a Combine star, jumping 43½ inches, the highest by an off-ball linebacker in 24 years and wowing other drills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;16. Jets (via Colts) — Alabama QB Ty Simpson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the Justin Fields experiment failed,  the Jets take a chance on the draft’s second-best quarterback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;17. Lions — Missouri EDGE Zion Young&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lions need a true edge threat opposite Aidan Hutchinson. Young started his college career at Michigan State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;18. Vikings — Toledo S Emmanuel McNeil-Warren&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If safety Harrison Smith retires, the Vikings would have to find a replacement in free agency or the draft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;19. Panthers — Clemson EDGE T.J. Parker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parker had 11 sacks two years ago but only five of them last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;20. Cowboys (via Packers) — LSU CB Mansoor Delane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s a potential top-10 pick and great value. The pick is one of the Cowboys they got for Parsons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;21. Steelers — Washington WR Denzel Boston&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aaron Rodgers will tell the Steelers his plans in the next two weeks. New coach Mike McCarthy needs firepower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;22. Chargers — Penn State G Olaivavega Ioane&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ioane didn’t allow a sack over his last two college seasons and gave up just three pressures year. That fits a Jim Harbaugh team like a pair of crisp khakis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;23. Eagles — Utah T Caleb Lomu&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the Eagles took star Lane Johnson fourth overall in 2013, they’ve drafted an offensive lineman in Round 1 just once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;24. Browns (via Jaguars) — Alabama T Kadyn Proctor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah believes the Browns should pick at least one tackle in Round 1 — if not two. Proctor is just 20 is stands a whopping 6-foot-7, 366 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;25. Bears — Ohio State DT Kayden McDonald&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pass rush remains the Bears’ biggest need but coach Ben Johnson said he’d be open to drafting an interior defensive lineman in Round 1. McDonald turns 21 in mid-March and was the anchor of a dominant OSU line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/l0qCiIaKX4k?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"2026 NFL DRAFT HIGHLIGHTS: DL Kayden McDonald | Ohio State Football\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young and Parker would make sense here&amp;nbsp;— but they've been taken. Drafting McDonald is also an acknowledgment that Texas A&amp;amp;M’s Cashius Howell doesn’t fit Dennis Allen’s prototype for defensive end. Howell’s arms measure 30¼ inches long&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;per Pro Football Focus, the shortest of any NFL Scouting Combine edge rusher since 1999. He stands just 6-foot-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howell acknowledged the criticism of his arms this week but said that “production has never been a real issue for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDonald, who is ESPN analyst Mel Kiper’s top-ranked defensive tackle, was a run-stuffer in college but many &lt;br&gt;believe there’s a pass rush to unlock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"On early downs, I can stop the run,” he said this week. “On third downs, I can push the pocket. I'm a complete player.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;26. Bills — &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M EDGE Cashius Howell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no doubting his production —&amp;nbsp;only two college players have more sacks over the past three years than his 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;27. 49ers — Clemson DT Peter Woods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Howell, Woods has short arms. The 49ers need to add defensive line depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;28. Texans — Georgia OT Morgan Freeling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one takes some projection — Freeling has just 16 starts to his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;29. Rams — Clemson CB Avieon Terrell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terrell stops his surprise fall and lands with the Rams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;30. Broncos — Oregon TE Kenyon Sadiq&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We still like teaming Sadiq with Bo Nix, his college quarterback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;31.

It will make one-time payments averaging $100 per vehicle to qualifying customers, the Bloomington-based insurance giant said on Thursday in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dividend is due to “stronger than expected underwriting performance, which has been reported industry wide,” it said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the largest dividend in State Farm’s history and will apply to more than 49 million vehicles insured by the company, but payments will vary by state and premiums paid. It didn’t specify how many Illinois customers are eligible, nor the average dividend payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also lowered auto insurance rates in 40 states by an average of 10% in recent months, due to decreasing auto repair costs and fewer collisions in 2025. The lower rates, including in Illinois, represent $4.6 billion in premium savings to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news comes weeks after State Farm CEO Jon Farney wrote Gov. JB Pritzker in January to push against legislation aimed at curbing insurance premium hikes, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/illinois-governor/2026/01/23/pritzker-pushes-back-at-state-farm-in-escalating-fight-for-tighter-insurance-regulations\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;WBEZ&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; previously reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker and other Democrats have been seeking a legislative remedy to State Farm home insurance premium increases &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/07/16/illinois-leaders-attack-state-farm-as-it-hikes-home-insurance-rates\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;last summer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that averaged 27%, jolting homeowners with massive sticker shock. In January, Farney said the state’s proposals would “destroy Illinois’ current healthy insurance market.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a stalled legislative plan that Pritzker wants to revive, insurers like State Farm could still propose whatever premium increases they want, but state insurance regulators would be empowered to force consumer refunds if the price hikes are deemed “unfair or excessive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker said eight states have regulatory frameworks in place similar to what he’s pushing and 41 have more restrictive standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Farm is one of Illinois’ largest employers with 21,000 workers at its Bloomington headquarters and agents across the state, according to Farney’s January letter. The company has about 65,000 employees total and more than 19,200 agent offices.&lt;/p&gt;",

For $25 a year, people can grow their own food in a raised bed in the Taylors’ garden, creating not just future meals, but stronger bonds between neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This homegrown solution aims to try to make healthy food more accessible in a community where people are expected to die earlier than in any other neighborhood in Chicago.

She has lost three relatives to cancer. The oldest was 60. It was devastating — here one day and gone the next, Taylor says. She’s also had her own health issues. She came down with a vitamin deficiency a few years ago that landed her in the hospital for about nine weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a really dark place that sickness took me to,” Taylor says, crediting her work in the community for helping her to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-4a0000\" name=\"html-embed-module-4a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"cpm-gfx-maps-combo\"&gt;\n  &lt;h3&gt;Heart disease, cancer&amp;nbsp;deaths are highest on the West&amp;nbsp;and South&amp;nbsp;sides&lt;/h3&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Deaths from chronic conditions, including heart&amp;nbsp;disease and cancer, are&amp;nbsp;among the biggest factors driving Chicago’s 10.6&amp;#x2011;year life&amp;nbsp;expectancy gap between Black&amp;nbsp;residents and other&amp;nbsp;races.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"cpm-gfx-maps-2up\"&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"cpm-gfx-map\"&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27815572\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27815572/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"cpm-gfx-map\"&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27763463\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27763463/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;style&gt;\n  .cpm-gfx-maps-combo h3 {\n    font-family: proxima-nova, Arial, sans-serif;\n    font-size: clamp(2.2rem, 3.5vw, 2rem);\n  }\n  .cpm-gfx-maps-combo p {\n    font-family: Arial;\n    font-size: 1.8rem;\n  }\n  .cpm-gfx-maps-combo .cpm-gfx-maps-2up {\n    align-items: flex-start;\n    column-gap: 1rem;\n    display: flex;\n    flex-direction: row;\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n    justify-content: space-between;\n    margin-top: 1rem;\n  }\n  .cpm-gfx-maps-combo .cpm-gfx-maps-2up .cpm-gfx-map {\n    flex: 1 1 auto;\n  }\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;WBEZ talked to and surveyed more than 50 people to understand the toll dying prematurely takes on Chicagoans and their communities.

As a child, he went back and forth between Chicago and his family’s farm in Mississippi. He’s the eighth of 15 kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he gets up around 6 am most days to tend to his garden, Sammie Taylor says it reminds him of his dad telling him to get up. They would feed hogs and chickens and load the trailer with hay to take to the cows. His large family had a garden, and would even make their own cornmeal. There was little need to go to the store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He carries these memories, and lessons learned on the farm, as he works rows of raised beds with the help of high school students and volunteers, teaching them how to grow and harvest vegetables and fruits, compost and recycle seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is nothing new to me,” Sammie Taylor says. “It just makes me think about home all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-b50000\" name=\"image-b50000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6cbb8b8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5779x3243+0+306/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F0a%2F7d9a43d94d48a5028cf47bed7feb%2Fdeathgap-chicagogarden-1107250010.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aafea01/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5779x3243+0+306/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F0a%2F7d9a43d94d48a5028cf47bed7feb%2Fdeathgap-chicagogarden-1107250010.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e091f4d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5779x3243+0+306/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F0a%2F7d9a43d94d48a5028cf47bed7feb%2Fdeathgap-chicagogarden-1107250010.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Tomatillos and a variety of peppers harvested by Sammie Taylor from his West Garfield Park community garden.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e091f4d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5779x3243+0+306/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F0a%2F7d9a43d94d48a5028cf47bed7feb%2Fdeathgap-chicagogarden-1107250010.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/945a2fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5779x3243+0+306/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F0a%2F7d9a43d94d48a5028cf47bed7feb%2Fdeathgap-chicagogarden-1107250010.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e091f4d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5779x3243+0+306/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F0a%2F7d9a43d94d48a5028cf47bed7feb%2Fdeathgap-chicagogarden-1107250010.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mix of produce bursting with color is grown and harvested at Sammie and Angela Taylor’s community garden in West Garfield Park.

People tell him he doesn’t age. He’s trim and fit, and looks younger than his 71 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What are you doing for yourself?” he says people ask. “I eat healthy.

Living Fresh Market in nearby suburban Forest Park has signed a letter of intent to open a grocery store as part of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/dpd-rfqs-and-rfps/home/west-garfield-park-madison-hamlin.html\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a larger development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; near Madison Street and Hamlin Boulevard in West Garfield Park, where &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/10/29/aldi-abruptly-closes-west-side-grocery-store-angering-residents-already-living-in-food-desert-its-a-dire-situation/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Aldi abruptly closed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2021. Customers can expect to shop there in about two years, says Christyn Freemon, a community wealth building consultant for Westgate Development Partners, the project developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/business/2025/02/10/savealot-yellow-banana-city-funding-complaints-overflowing-dumpsters-rats\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a Save A Lot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in West Garfield Park, but some residents criticize the quality of the food. Jerome Bouyer, vice president of retail operations for the company, says customers should give the store another chance, saying their meat and produce “I think will stand against any competitor.” He added that fresh produce is delivered typically two to three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales at that Save A Lot have been flat, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, West Side United, a coalition that aims to close the life expectancy gap on the West Side, is training and connecting about 20 organizations that work on food access and nutrition, from community gardens to food pantries. They share resources, learn to design surveys for residents to better understand their needs, and receive small grants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One organization bought a van to help pick up food, while another is building out a test kitchen to lead food demos for community members, says Elle Lynn Quimpo, program director of the COLLAB Network, an initiative at West Side United.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-b60000\" name=\"html-embed-module-b60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/26338511\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/26338511/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"chart visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking forward to another growing season&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at the Taylors’ community garden, the annual ritual begins as Angela and Sammie prepare for the next growing season. They are nurturing seedlings — onions, romaine lettuce, blue steak tomatoes and more — in the greenhouse. Cucumbers, cabbages and peppers soon may follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ll wait for the threat of frost to subside, typically in May around Mother’s Day, then transplant the seedlings into the raised beds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it’s closer to home, the better it is for you,” Angela Taylor says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-460000\" name=\"image-460000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/10fc771/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2Fe5%2F3171aa3549ce8dfc299b0f5097d5%2Fdeathgap-chicagogarden-1107250005.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b779053/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2Fe5%2F3171aa3549ce8dfc299b0f5097d5%2Fdeathgap-chicagogarden-1107250005.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1529b56/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2Fe5%2F3171aa3549ce8dfc299b0f5097d5%2Fdeathgap-chicagogarden-1107250005.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Sammie Taylor in the greenhouse in the community garden next to his home, one of several he supports through the Garfield Park Garden Network.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1529b56/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2Fe5%2F3171aa3549ce8dfc299b0f5097d5%2Fdeathgap-chicagogarden-1107250005.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d96de43/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2Fe5%2F3171aa3549ce8dfc299b0f5097d5%2Fdeathgap-chicagogarden-1107250005.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1529b56/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2Fe5%2F3171aa3549ce8dfc299b0f5097d5%2Fdeathgap-chicagogarden-1107250005.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the summer and fall, Sammie Taylor harvests produce from his community garden and picks up hundreds of pounds of produce from other gardens in Garfield Park to sell at the local neighborhood market he and his wife, Angela, helped start.

But still proud of that group of guys, proud of my ability to continue to be a good teammate and still uplift guys, show up in less ways than I wanted to – but I do still feel like I was a big part of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But it leaves you hungry. It leaves you motivated. It was something I had to wrestle with through the offseason.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conforto, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/25/cubs-outfielder-michael-conforto-joins-evolving-bench-battle\"   &gt;in strong position to claim a roster spot out of camp,&lt;/a&gt; is pursuing a bounce back after putting together the worst offensive season of his career last year with the Dodgers. He had a .199 batting average in 138 regular season games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Along the way, I lost the discipline in my routine and the things that really prompted the Dodgers to sign me,” Conforto said. “I kind of got away from that stuff and started trying to make adjustments in season, [which] is never a good place to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conforto worked this offseason with several instructors, including former super-utility player Howie Kendrick, who emphasized the lower half of Conforto’s swing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to get back to me, find myself again,” Conforto said. “And I feel great. Part of the reason I'm taking an NRI is because I feel confident, and I feel excited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By joining the Cubs, Conforto reunited with left-hander &lt;b&gt;Matthew Boyd&lt;/b&gt;, his former Oregon State University teammate and fellow Seattle-area native.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mike's amazing,” Boyd said Thursday. “Mike's a winner. He won in college, he won in high school – because I've known him that long and longer. And he's another guy that's a natural leader. He's a selfless dude. And it's kind of fun, because I haven't seen him as hungry as he is right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Alcántara into game action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cubs outfielder &lt;b&gt;Kevin Alcántara&lt;/b&gt; is set to appear in a game for the first time this spring on Saturday, manager &lt;b&gt;Criag Counsell&lt;/b&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"You'll see him regularly, but we're just going to be a little cautious,” Counsell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set to serve as the designated hitter against the Dodgers, Alcántara’s schedule has been a little behind as he continues to ramp up from offseason hernia surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We've got plenty of time,” Counsell said. “He's ready to go, he's kind of pushing us, so it's the right time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bethancourt reports&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cubs catcher &lt;b&gt;Christian Bethancourt&lt;/b&gt; reported to camp on Thursday after a lengthy visa-related delay. He then had a full workout scheduled Friday morning. Bethancourt, a non-roster invitee, is scheduled to play Saturday and then leave again to join Team Panama for the World Baseball Classic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bethancourt at least had the advantage of training at home as he waited for the resolution of his visa issues.

Except for his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lazaro Vargas played third base his entire 22-year career in Cuba, with whom he won gold medals at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That position has always been special to me,” Miguel Vargas said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is Vargas’ jersey No. 20, which his dad wore, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When he first saw it, he cried,” Vargas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vargas remains close to his dad, his daily dominoes opponent during the offseason in Miami. If they talked baseball over the games, Vargas’ best season yet, 2025, probably came up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vargas batted .234/.316/.401 with 16 homers, 32 doubles, 80 runs and 60 RBI in 138 games. He led the team in doubles and runs scored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I achieved a lot of things that I wanted to achieve, especially playing the whole year in the big leagues and staying healthy,” said Vargas, who appeared in 79 games at third base, 69 at first and one in left field. “Helping my team every day was special. It’s hard to stay healthy the whole year in the big leagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My biggest challenge is to play third base every day. Offensively I want to lower my strikeout rate [17.6%] I wasn’t striking out too much, but nobody likes to strike out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody likes to lose as well, and Vargas is aiming for less of that as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a really good group and I’m excited about this season,” said Vargas, who was 2-for-3 with a double against MacKenzie Gore Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benintendi joins list of hurt outfielders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left fielder Andrew Benintendi was scratched from the lineup with tightness in his right side, joining center fielders Luisangel Acuna and Everson Pereria on the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just right side tightness,” manager Will Venable said. “He’s been running around a lot, swinging a lot. Really just precautionary, he said he feels fine. I think he would play if this was the regular season, but just want to be cautious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acuna sustained a cut above his left eye sliding into second base Wednesday. His helmet became dislodged and caused a gash requiring four stitches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pereria has a right oblique strain and is not expected back soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Just win, baby&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right-hander Erick Fedde, back on the pitching staff after being away for one and a half seasons, echoed what other pitchers are hearing from coaches in camp: Pound the strike zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’ve been harping on ‘win the first three,’ ’’ Fedde said. “I’m sure you’ve heard it from other guys. It’s been the heart and soul of the pitching mentality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winning the first three is throwing strikes on two of the first three pitches. Fedde threw 19 of 29 pitches for strikes over two scoreless innings Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The [coaches and staff] share our numbers like, ‘look what you do when you win two out of three and what you do when you don’t win’ it so it’s been a mindset of mine,” Fedde said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today was let’s attack these guys and the numbers say it’s better, so let’s do it and trust it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOX 3, RANGERS 1 (ss)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;BREWERS 5, SOX 2 (ss)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox (5-4) got a home run from LaMonte Wade Jr. and a pair of hits from Miguel Vargas (.384) against the Rangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Right-hander Mike Vasil, an effective reliever who wants to be considered as a starter, struck out four while allowing two walks and three hits over three innings of one-run ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• On the Sox top prospect watch, top lefty pitching prospect Noah Schultz struck out three and walked none while allowing a run on three hits against the Brewers. Schultz threw 23 of 33 pitches for strikes. Righty Tanner McDougal allowed two runs on four hits and no walks while striking out three over three innings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• On deck: Sox at Guardians, Saturday, 2:05 p.m.,

Obviously, everyone wants to have a great end of the season. But when the sun comes out and you get to play hockey while it's nice out in Chicago, that's the best time.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nazar, 22, and many of his equally young (or younger) teammates are motivated to prove some things before the April 15 season finale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks' rusty &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/02/26/blackhawks-connor-bedard-fire-predators-nhl-power-play-quarterback\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;4-2 defeat&lt;/a&gt; Thursday against the Predators didn't mark a great start to this 25-game run, and their lives won't get any easier Saturday against the Avalanche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Connor Bedard put it, \"every team you play is going to be good\" —&amp;nbsp;because \"it's a good league.\" The Hawks will have to figure out how to surpass this steep competition eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"What I'm focusing on right now is to play the rest of the year the right way and take steps forward, as a group, to become a great hockey team,\" Nazar said. \"It might not happen this year, but if we make steps right now...then coming into next year, we'll be even better.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For rookie forward Ryan Greene, for example, the coming weeks offer a crucial opportunity to prove he's not only a good-enough temporary option on Bedard's wing —&amp;nbsp;where he has unexpectedly spent much of this season —&amp;nbsp;but a legitimate top-six NHL player for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrivals of Anton Frondell and Roman Kantserov will greatly increase competition for those roles. But Greene, also 22, does have one advantage: he's already 59 games along his NHL development curve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He admitted he was \"running on fumes\" before the Olympic break, but he has looked rejuvenated since. He stood out in practices and followed that up with a quality performance Thursday, highlighted by a nifty assist on Bedard's goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The more [Ryan] can prove he's a guy that can add value to that line, the better off he is, especially as we continue to the future,\" coach Jeff Blashill said. \"There will be different options that we'll have, and he wants to ... show he's the best option.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For rookie defenseman Sam Rinzel, the end of last season has also been on his mind, because that's when he played his best in the NHL so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This season has been more of a roller coaster, which isn't surprising for a 21-year-old with a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/02/03/blackhawks-sam-rinzel-brainpower-weight-strength-zach-werenski-artyom-levshunov\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;less-than-filled-out body&lt;/a&gt; trying to compete against pros for 82 games rather than nine. Still, he hopes to demonstrate he can at least climb back to that peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I knew there were going to be bumps, but [this season] didn't go the way I thought or wanted it to go,\" Rinzel said. \"Getting sent down, as a player, it's really frustrating. I'm happy with ... how I went about it, looking in the mirror and trying to see what I needed to get better at.

There’s no no-brainer choice for Opening Day four weeks from now, and the top three in the projected rotation have an average of 162 major league innings of experience between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order, Shane Smith, Davis Martin and left-hander Anthony Kay have grips on the top three spots. Erick Fedde, a $1.5 million last-minute addition as a free agent signed before camp opened, is back after getting traded away in 2024 and likely has the fourth spot to lose. Fedde threw two scoreless innings against the Rangers in his spring debut Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My mentality this whole time is that spot’s not mine,” Fedde said. “I have to earn it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sean Burke, the surprise 2025 Opening Day starter who didn’t last the season in the majors, could be the fifth starter. Burke allowed two earned runs on three hits and a walk against the Brewers in a split squad game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a strength that we have a lot of question marks because competition is very high right now,” Martin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pitching group is closely knit, Martin said, citing another strength. He insists there’s value there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to explain but everybody has played with someone, at one level or another, with a starter in your rotation who is hoping you do bad so it makes them look better,” Martin said. “We don’t have that. Everybody celebrates the other guy’s victory and if someone has a bad game, you pick him up. It’s a really big thing. It makes for a lot less toxic environment knowing the guys actually give a crap about you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lefties Sean Newcomb and Chris Murphy and right-hander Jonathan Cannon also want in on the competition. Mike Vasil wants a chance to get out of the bullpen and be a starter, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competing against friends in spring training is “weird,\" Fedde said, but the best rotations he’s been a part of compete against each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I see that nature in a lot of these guys,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But camaraderie and competition within the group only goes so far. After going 60-102 last season, most betting sites set the Sox over/under for wins this season between 64 and 67 while PECOTA’s sabremetric system is kinder, projecting the Sox for 69 victories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would represent improvements of four to nine more wins than last season, decent but not significant in large part because of what the rotation looks like on paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s what the Sox have to go with now while top prospects such as first-round lefties Noah Schultz and Hagen Smith get development starts at Triple-A Charlotte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These guys just need to continue to throw strikes, do their thing,” manager Will Venable said. “They’re all working on something different. They just need to command their arsenal, do everything they need to do, control the running game, just continue to throw strikes and we’ll see how it all shakes out at the end of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListL\" data-module  data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a

Part of free agency was sitting through such presentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquired via trade, right-hander Edward Cabrera got none of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’d known that his name was being bandied about in Marlins trade talks, but &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/01/07/chicago-cubs-in-serious-talks-with-miamimarlins-to-acquire-rhp-edward-cabrera-mlb-trade\"   &gt;his landing spot &lt;/a&gt;was out of his control. So, much of the early part of spring has been about laying the foundation that he and the Cubs weren’t able to get a head start on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's different, even the weather,” Cabrera said in the early days of camp, through team interpreter Fredy Quevedo Jr. “But I always try to be on the same page. And I feel really good. I feel really good with the staff here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cabrera made his first start Cactus League start on Friday, tossing two perfect innings and striking out half of the Guardians batters he faced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s been juggling so much newness, transitioning into a new organization for the first time in a decade, that the Cubs tried to tailor his ramp-up schedule to what was familiar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's really just that onboarding process,” pitching coach Tommy Hottovy told the Sun-Times. “Getting to know him, getting to know his routines, what he does in the weight room, the training room, throwing routines, bullpen routines, all those things — and then slow-dosing him information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hottovy doesn't like to open conversations after live batting practice or games with his observations. He’d rather see what the player is gravitating towards first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He definitely loves attacking the strike zone,” Hottovy said. “He tailors a lot of his identity, I think, in the bullpen work and lives to strikes. And we know if his stuff is in the strike zone, he's really freaking good. I also want him to give himself some credit that he's not going to be perfect all the time and that competitive misses are positive for him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a natural progression coming off of last season, when he cut down his walk rate from 12% the previous year to 8.3%. The next step is to find a little bit of a happy medium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same concept could also contribute to a shift in pitch usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of his usage was tied to the strike zone,” Hottovy said. “Which is great; he knows what he can throw in the strike zone. Now, I think there's little things we can tweak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cabrera has long leaned on his 94-mph changeup as his primary pitch. Last year, he threw his curveball second-most, followed by his sinker, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/01/16/why-cubs-saw-edward-cabrera-answer-long-quest-starting-pitching-jed-hoyer-tommy-hottovy\"   &gt;which overtook his four-seamer as his most-used fastball&lt;/a&gt; because he was more comfortable throwing it for strikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two innings Friday, however, his four-seamer was his most-used pitch (32%), according to Statcast, followed by his changeup (26%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That's one thing that I want to do, I want to throw it more,” Cabrera said. “And then it can contribute to my other pitches as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cubs also want to make sure Cabrera has a good physical foundation, in part to combat his extensive injury history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're doing a much better job as an organization when we acquire guys understanding what they've dealt with,” Hottovy said, “diving into the biomechanics as to why we think that might be coming up and if there's anything that we can help fix or help clean up throughout the process. So definitely making sure that strength numbers are in a good place, range of motion, getting just a full diagnostic of who this player is extremely important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-velocity pitchers like Cabrera tend to be more injury-prone. But the industry has also come to understand that delivery efficiency both will help protect health, and can bump up velocity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Cubs can keep Cabrera on the field, his stuff and continued strides will raise the rotation’s ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said manager Craig Counsell: “We just think this is a talented pitcher coming into the right part of his career.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, title=Latest on the Cubs, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, count=13725, items=[{authors=[{name=[{items=[Maddie Lee]}], authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/maddie-lee, jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Cubs reporter]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[], media=[]}], type=Image, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, media=[{narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/e9/be/970d4da94ef6b4b1a13805179a16/2149341984.jpg, width=7132, height=4755}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/e9/be/970d4da94ef6b4b1a13805179a16/2149341984.jpg, width=7132, height=4755}, alt=Houston Astros v Chicago Cubs}], _styledTemplate=null, description=[{items=[Long before they reunited with the Cubs, Bregman and Swanson were teammates for one memorable summer.]}], imageAlignment=null, isFeatured=false, wordCount=591, target=null, anchorId=promo-f70002, primaryMediaType=null, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/26/cubs-alex-bregmans-and-dansby-swansons-careers-have-long-run-parallel-now-theyve-converged-for-a-second-time, timestamp=1772159379000, ampLink=null, title=Cubs&amp;#x27;

First, you learn new information, from the new people you talk to and the new stuff you see. Learning new things is fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And second, you then can apply this new knowledge, making all sorts of interesting connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, struggling to articulate the general numbness of watching President Donald Trump's &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2026/02/24/president-donald-trump-state-of-the-union-speech-illinois-democrats-boycott\"   &gt;State of the Union address &lt;/a&gt;Tuesday, I remembered a cannulated cow seen at Chicago's High School for Agriculture Sciences in Mount Greenwood (What? You didn't know about either cannulated cows or the ag high school? Well, I'm happy to be the one to tell you.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAGA types, who don't seem at all keen on either new people or new ideas, imagine liberals in some kind of pearl-clutching agony, or door-jamb-gnawing fury. But truly, nearly two hours of the State of the Union speech left me mostly bored. We've heard all this before, many times, from the moment candidate Trump descended that escalator in his monstrous brass and orange stone lobby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-ab0000\" name=\"module-ab0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Opinion bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,\" he said. \"They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was more of the same. When he wasn't lying about the economy or gaslighting — for example,  declaring war on fraud — Trump was grinding over the threat of immigrants. Both criminals &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; bad drivers. That's where I thought of the cannulated cow. How cows digest their food is important to the dairy industry, and one way to keep tabs is to surgically implant a round window into the side of a cow.  Students and scientists look through the window, into the cow's stomach, and watch the half-digested mash sloshing around. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the State of the Union speech. The same well-chewed slop of fear, hatred, lies, prejudice, nationalism and enormous self-regard that Trump has been spewing for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the many dangers of this moment is exhaustion. The liars lie nonstop, while those familiar with the truth get tired of repeating ourselves, bloodying our fingers scratching at that brick wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet scratch we must. So forgive me for belaboring the obvious for the benefit of — well, I'm not sure who at this point. Either you understood long ago or you never will. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current war on immigrants is not only morally and economically wrong, but entirely based on lies — haters are cowards, and rather than just admit they're surrendering to fear (of new people and new things) they slur the object of their fixation. They don't hate immigrants because immigrants are criminals; they tar them as criminals because they hate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, again: Immigrants commit less crime and have fewer traffic accidents than U.S.-born citizens. That makes sense: if you could be deported to some central American hell-hole for a speeding ticket, you'd drive slower too. But let's gild the lily and turn to research: a 2014 Purdue study crunching 24 years of immigration data found that as the population of illegal immigrants in a state increases, DUIs go down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Undocumented persons may be less likely to drive after drinking, or drive at all, because of fear of police surveillance and deportation,” the authors wrote in the American Journal of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying wash away the sour contents of the cesspool that the president spattered all over my carpet Tuesday, I remembered the Bad Bunny show two weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad Bunny spoke to me. Well, sang, and not just to me. In Spanish, true, but I understood exactly what he was saying, about his home, Puerto Rico, his joyous, colorful world that includes old people, young people, a rainbow of colors and lifestyles, with joy and dancing. Some 128 million others watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or 96 million more than endured the president's spew. Only 32 million viewers endured the all-too-familiar speech, as if parking ourselves cross-legged before a front-loading washing machine filled with barf. A spectacle that managed to both sicken and bore at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strange that a halftime music show would offer more hope for the future of our country than a presidential address. Though never mistake hope for action. Those who do not want to spend the rest of our lives consuming enormous helpings of moral chunder are going to have to stay focused and work very hard to settle the nation's stomach. None of it will be fun or easy, and good people are going to continue to suffer and die. But better than the alternative, of mooing quietly while our nation sinks beneath the rising muck.&lt;/p&gt;",

The Alamos tried to stop him and followed him outside, according to prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Thomas pulled out a gun and allegedly shot Luis Angel Alamo, according to prosecutors who added Faustino Alamo then fired off shots using his gun, but did not hit Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the juveniles waiting in the Maserati jumped out and allegedly shot Faustino Alamo, prosecutors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bodies of the father and son lay side by side along a curb as traffic continued to drive past, according to surveillance video posted by Telemundo Chicago. Both men were pronounced dead less than an hour later at Mount Sinai Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas and the two juveniles allegedly fled and police officers later found the Maserati that had been set on fire, according to prosecutors who added Thomas’ DNA and fingerprints were found inside the store and on the burned Maserati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the juveniles was later arrested on an unrelated case and allegedly gave detectives information on the Nov. 8 attack. Prosecutors said the juvenile allegedly identified Thomas as one of the shooters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court information and charges for the juveniles was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas was arrested Tuesday in St. Louis by Chicago police and members of the U.S. Marshals Great Lakes Regional Fugitive Task Force.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

And the economic impact of arts and culture in the fourth quarter was more than $575 million — the highest in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, last year's foot traffic was 84% of 2019's traffic that was an estimated 85 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks said the Loop Arts District will elevate the cultural institutions in the neighborhood and reimagine State Street as “a playful, experiential cultural spine.\" The district is also envisioned as a way to stitch together attractions such as Millennium Park and the Chicago Riverwalk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Loop Alliance is working with the organization Arts Alliance Illinois and consultancy firm Sound Diplomacy on an economic impact study on the arts, which will be released this summer, and it will announce more arts-related public programming announced at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The importance of the arts to Downtown was also the focus of a panel discussion at the meeting, which drew nearly 500 attendees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Collins, executive director of the Goodman Theatre, said the arts are key to the Loop because it attracts viewers from every neighborhood. It’s also an experience more people want in today’s age, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People come to the theater and they feel connected [to] people around them. They feel connected to something larger than themselves,” Collins said. “I think acutely, in this moment post-COVID, the demand and the need for experiences that provide that type of connection is stronger than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Loop Alliance also announced it received an $800,000 two-year grant from the Department of Planning and Development to help fill vacant storefronts, through community investment like preparing the empty spaces and supporting small businesses. The number of vacant storefronts on State Street dropped nearly 14% in the fourth quarter of 2025, compared to the previous quarter. More than 40 new restaurants, cafes and retail stores opened or will open soon in the Loop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The organization also received a $1.1 million grant to expand its social service outreach program in the Central Business District. The program will launch in the spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Loop Alliance CEO Michael Edwards said the member-based business organization “continues to thrive.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Loop Alliance in 2025 supported funding for the Chicago Transit Authority, along with the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/04/25/office-residential-conversions-apartments-housing-downtown\"   &gt;LaSalle Corridor Revitalization&lt;/a&gt; projects in the Loop.

Research from commercial real estate firm Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield shows the city’s office vacancy rate rose steadily throughout 2025, ending the year at 26.9%. That figure has been on an uptick since mid-2020, according to the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Onni Group, Shamrock Trading, Zurich and Hireology all signed deals to lease or own office buildings in the Loop. Logistics company Shamrock plans to expand its existing Lombard office to Downtown. Software firm Hireology will move into the upper floors of the Marshall Field building, 24 E.

Edwards is stepping down on March 31 as the CEO, after 13 years at its helm. The organization plans to name his successor by April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your dedication and hard work and unwavering optimism has shaped … the city,” James Turner, past chair and board member of the Chicago Loop Alliance, said. “Thank you for your years of service, your leadership and your friendship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contributing: Amy Yee&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/work/2026/01/12/chicago-loop-alliance-ceo-michael-edwards-step-down\"   &gt;Chicago Loop Alliance CEO Michael Edwards to step down&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/04/25/office-residential-conversions-apartments-housing-downtown\"   &gt;Offices in the Loop and beyond are being converted to apartments.

If only it was that simple.\" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/496d5f3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4714x3143+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F18%2F17%2F1e03b22e4f04a9588c8233d3716d%2F2252468813.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;Bulls guard Josh Giddey never has been one to point fingers or get caught up in making excuses, so he’s not about to start now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giddey would have every right to do so, given he has watched half the nameplates in the locker room change in the last month and given the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bulls\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Bulls&lt;/a&gt;’ 11-game losing streak. In his mind, however, this is the NBA, and pros don’t dwell on what has gone wrong. They try to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘Our job is to go out and perform and win games,’’ Giddey said. ‘‘Obviously, we’re not going to keep using the excuse it’s a new team. We’re past that part now. It is frustrating because you build so much continuity with the team you have, and then it gets torn apart within a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We’ve got to find ways to get out of the hole and figure it out as a group. Nobody is feeling sorry for us. There aren’t asterisks on the stat sheet saying it’s a new team together. It’s on us as players to figure this out.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s good thinking, but how do the Bulls do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Giddey and the rest of the Bulls don’t do a better job of taking care of the ball, then getting to know one another better, making shots and playing better defense won’t really mean much. It starts there, and the ugly numbers back that up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their last five games, the Bulls have committed 99 turnovers (19.8 per game) and have allowed 119 points (23.8 per game) off those turnovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘It’s really, in a lot of ways, the decision-making in the moment,’’ coach Billy Donovan said. ‘‘We’ve just got to try getting better at it. It’s hard because a few of them were just careless turnovers, [such as] the ball was handled too much or trying to do too much with the ball and it’s just not there. But more than anything, it’s the decision-making piece that we’ve got to keep working at and keep showing them to try to get better at.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there was a training camp to do that or even a few consecutive days of practice, maybe Donovan and his staff could start chipping away at some of the bad habits. But Donovan is fighting another uphill battle, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only are several of his key ballhandlers, such as Giddey and Tre Jones, on minutes restrictions, but the Bulls are undermanned in the frontcourt, too. Even if he could get his guards to play with better ball security, they’re playing with teammates such as seldom-used forward Leonard Miller and undersized Guerschon Yabusele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a winning roster when it’s at full strength, let alone playing with a bunch of&lt;br&gt;G Leaguers and castoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donovan never will admit it, but it’s unlikely the Bulls will win games consistently for the rest of this season. Still, that doesn’t mean he can’t do everything possible to try to coach some winning habits into his team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why he’s focused so much on second-year guard Rob Dillingham. Since arriving from the Timberwolves in the trade for Ayo Dosunmu, Dillingham has been trying to re-establish himself as a prospect after being selected No. 8 overall in the 2024 draft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donovan remains all-in on helping him in that process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘I’ve had talks with Rob about getting him to try to change his mentality,’’ Donovan said. ‘‘He viewed himself as a scoring point guard, which is good, but you also have to be efficient [at] his size. How can he change his mentality of how he needs to start looking at the game?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘We’re trying to help these guys, as well as going out and win. Can I use this time to try to help them? It may not always lead to wins, but it may help make them better players.’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-8f0005\" name=\"list-8f0005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bulls\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, items=[{type=Image, description=[{items=[While coach Billy Donovan said he has only been told by his bosses to do everything he can to compete on a nightly basis, no one associated with the team’s front office should have been upset with Thursday’s 11th straight stumble, especially because of the draft pick implications surrounding it.]}], timestamp=1772165244000, authors=[{jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Bulls reporter]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, media=[{narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/bd/9b/8fe15ac7524e52710ea7cf4aed7f/9-15-lachat-cowley-4-0.jpg, width=512, height=512}, alt=9-15-lachat-cowley-4-0.jpg, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/bd/9b/8fe15ac7524e52710ea7cf4aed7f/9-15-lachat-cowley-4-0.jpg, width=512, height=512}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs}], bio=[{items=[Joe Cowley covers the Chicago Bulls for the Chicago Sun-Times.]}], authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/joe-cowley, name=[{items=[Joe Cowley]}]}], _styledTemplate=null, publishDate=February 26, 2026 10:07 PM, imageAlignment=null, isFeatured=false, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/bulls, anchorId=promo-260005, target=null, primaryMediaType=null, wordCount=560, category=[{items=[Bulls]}], ampLink=null, audio=[], media=[{alt=Trail Blazers Bulls Basketball, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/6a/4a/9e58cb8845a6a080834d87b72a80/trail-blazers-bulls-basketball.jpg, width=1940, height=1293}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/6a/4a/9e58cb8845a6a080834d87b72a80/trail-blazers-bulls-basketball.jpg, width=1940, height=1293}}], audioDuration=null, title=Bulls pick good night to lose and the right team to lose to in Portland, _template=/page/promo/PagePromo.hbs, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/bulls/2026/02/26/bulls-good-night-lose-and-right-team-to-lose-to-in-portland}, {type=Image, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, isFeatured=false, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/bulls, timestamp=1772159631000, description=[{items=[Donovan can’t afford to play slow, especially with the new-look roster after the trade deadline.

He was 84. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson is a Chicago icon known for his work as a civil rights leader. \"All are welcome\" for services scheduled this week, according to his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When are services?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson will lie in repose &lt;b&gt;Thursday &lt;/b&gt;and &lt;b&gt;Friday&lt;/b&gt;, at Rainbow PUSH's Kenwood headquarters at 930 E. 50th St. The services both days will start at 10 a.m. Doors will close to the public and media at 9 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service dates were adjusted after officials in South Carolina and Washington, D.C., offered to memorialize him there as well, so his remains will be traveling between Sunday and March 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;b&gt;March 2&lt;/b&gt;, a full day of recognition will take place at and near the South Carolina state capitol, according to communications from Rainbow PUSH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson will lie in repose at the Statehouse in Columbia before private, public and church services take place throughout the day. A formal service will take place at 10 a.m. at 1100 Gervais St., Columbia, S.C., 29208. Later that afternoon, a tribute service will be held at Brookland Baptist Church from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m at 1066 Sunset Blvd.  Pastor Charles B. Jackson, Sr. will be officiating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On &lt;b&gt;March 4&lt;/b&gt;, a formal service will take place in Washington, D.C. Details are forthcoming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Incorporated, a Divine Nine fraternity that Jackson was part of, will hold a celebration of life service at 5 p.m. on March 5 at Rainbow PUSH. Grand officers, district officers and various members of the fraternity will be in attendance, said a district representative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A \"People's Celebration\" in Chicago will be held at 10 a.m. &lt;b&gt;March 6&lt;/b&gt;, at House of Hope, 752 E. 114th St. Doors open at 9 a.m. Additional parking will be available at nearby businesses. Shuttles will then transport people to the venue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janet Pickett, the general manager at House of Hope, said they are planning for more than 9,000 people to attend. (The venue seats 9,600.) There is no word yet on who will be leading the services, she said. Ushers and personnel for the event will be staffed by House of Hope and Rainbow PUSH. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private homegoing services are scheduled for 10 a.m. &lt;b&gt;March 7&lt;/b&gt;, at Rainbow PUSH. Doors open at 8 a.m., with limited capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relatives of Jackson said that \"all are welcome,\" regardless of political party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Do not bring your politics, out of respect to Rev. Jesse Jackson and the life that he lived, to these homegoing services. They come respectful and come to say thank you,\" Jesse Jackson Jr. said during a media event in front of the Jackson family home. \"But these homegoing services are welcome to all — Democrat, Republican, liberal and conservative, right wing, left wing, because his life is broad enough to cover the full spectrum of what it means to be an American.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family will livestream all services at JesseJacksonLegacy.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How are Chicagoans paying their respects at the services?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands gathered at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/26/rev-jesse-jackson-lying-in-repose-rainbow-push-chicago\"   &gt;Rainbow PUSH on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; to pay their respects to Jackson. The family procession arrived after 8 a.m. As the morning wore on, hundreds were lined up to show their gratitude for Jackson and be a part of a historical moment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayor Brandon Johnson and Rev. Al Sharpton were in attendance on Thursday to pay their respects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We spent a lifetime together,\" said Sharpton outside the Rainbow PUSH headquarters. \"He raised a generation of us and he never gave up, even when he was sick.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friday's crowds included &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/27/jesse-jacksons-death-inspires-young-people-more-present-community\"   &gt;several Black youth that were inspired by Jackson&lt;/a&gt; to be more present in their community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among them was Nadiyah Spikener, 24, who said Jackson's death could be a catalyst for young people to learn more about their history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This may be a moment to realize that maybe we need to do more for ourselves, and do more for our community like he has, and just start somewhere,\" she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What hotels are recommended for those traveling to Chicago for the events?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those traveling to Chicago to attend services are encouraged to stay at the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place Chicago at 2233 S. Martin Luther King Drive, according to the family's website. Rooms at the hotel have been reserved within a hotel block, with limited availability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where can people park?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those hoping to attend the Jackson lying in state events, street parking is available at Rainbow PUSH on South Drexel Boulevard, East 49th Street, East Hyde Park Boulevard and East 49th Street. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the People's Celebration, parking will be available at House of Hope's parking lot on 113th Street. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What security measures will be in place?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At each event, security checks and magnetometers will be in place. The family's website asks that individuals limit items brought to smooth the process.  Weapons, signs and any items that could disrupt services are prohibited&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on the scheduled services visit &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.jessejacksonlegacy.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;jessejacksonlegacy.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where will the Rev.

Former Chicago Mayor Harold Washington, journalist and civil rights activist Ida B. Wells and Olympic athlete Jesse Owens are among those buried there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How did he die?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While his family has not given an official cause of death nor said where he died, Jackson had been declining in health for a decade before his death. In 2015,&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2017/11/17/18375473/rev-jesse-jackson-announces-parkinson-s-diagnosis\"   &gt; Jackson was initially diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, but he revealed last April that he actually had progressive supranuclear palsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How is the political world reacting to his death?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political figures from across the country have weighed in to pay their respects and honor his legacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement, former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama wrote: \"Michelle and I will always be grateful for Jesse's lifetime of service, and the friendship our families share. We stood on his shoulders. We send our deepest condolences to the Jackson family and everyone in Chicago and beyond who knew and loved him.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump also extended his sympathies to Jackson's family in a statement posted to Truth Social last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I knew him well, long before becoming President,\" he said. \"He was very gregarious — Someone who truly loved people! Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago leaders, including Mayor Brandon Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker, also shared their condolences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"In honor of Rev. Jackson's service, and as our city mourns, the Chicago flag will lower to half-staff,\" Mayor Johnson wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker also ordered all flags across the state to fly at half-mast to honor him in a statement posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He broke down barriers, inspired generations, and kept hope alive. Our state, nation, and world are better due to his years of service,\" Pritzker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How are Chicagoans reacting to his death?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the city, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2026/02/17/jesse-jackson-chicago-remembers\"   &gt;Chicago residents mourned Jackson’s death&lt;/a&gt; and urged that his legacy continue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Travis, a congregant of Apostolic Church of God in Woodlawn, said in his youth, his parents brought him to demonstrations organized by Operation Breadbasket, a movement Jackson led. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, 64, Travis remembers Jackson as \"instrumental in fighting for justice and freedom for all people.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chloe Gould, 41, a Bronzeville resident, said that his death hit \"like you lost a family member.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of his death, she said she worries about the future of civil rights activism, as other activists and leaders have not stepped in to fill his shoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Who is gonna be the civil rights activist now?\" she asked. &lt;/p&gt;",

David Moore (17th).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"She'd come to constituent night to give me my orders in terms of making things more accessible in the ward, and then she'd say, before I could even reply, 'And, David, I love you, and there's nothing you can do about it.' And it shut me right up and all I could say was 'I'll get on it,'\" Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was also part of a group of veterans who were the driving force behind the creation of the South Side Memorial Day Parade, Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Peyton was &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.pbs.org/video/chicago-portrait-babette-peyton-78cdgu/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;featured on WTTW’s “Chicago Tonight” in 2020&lt;/a&gt; that opened with footage of Ms. Peyton rolling up in her wheelchair to a community garden in Gresham to feed some roosters, which ran to her as she sang: \"Thank you, God. I want to tell you that I love you. I want to tell you that I'm thinking of you. Every minute, every hour, every second of the day. How you doing? I love you! Come on!\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Peyton was born Aug 15, 1952, to Arthur Peyton Jr., an Air Force veteran who later worked as a mail carrier, and Rosette Caldwell Peyton, a special education teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She grew up in South Shore and graduated from South Shore High School before joining the Army in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stationed in West Germany, Ms. Peyton worked at hospital when she was court-martialed in 1975 for refusing to remove cornrows from her hair, a case that was covered in the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was ultimately dismissed because it was determined that the order to remove the cornrows had been improperly issued, according to a United Press International story published in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"She was very outspoken and stood up for anything she thought wasn't right, especially all types of discrimination,\" said her niece, Kathy Chaney, a former Sun-Times editor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Peyton suffered a spinal injury in 1976 that was the result of a friendly fire incident during a training exercise in her last year in the Army, she told the Sun-Times in a story published in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was honorably discharged and later attended the University of Maryland before earning a Master of Arts in education from Northwestern University, her family said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also was an entrepreneur who started the Peyton Elevator Company with her brother Renard Peyton, which installed elevators in Chicago, including at several South Side churches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"She was the first Black female elevator contractor in the city,\" Chaney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her message to everyone was always \"Do not give up,\" her family said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is survived by her siblings Celeste Randolph and Renard Peyton, as well as 11 nephews and nieces.&lt;/p&gt;",

The Bears certainly don’t want a repeat of last season, when they started with Braxton Jones, benched him for Theo Benedet, then benched Benedet for Trapilo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offensive line coach Dan Roushar said on an episode of five-time Pro Bowl left tackle Terron Armstead’s podcast, The Set, that it’s “to be determined” whether the team has an in-house solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know what the left tackle position looks like in this league,” Roushar said in an episode released this week. “[Armstead is] the standard. That’s a rare player that comes along. But somebody has to play that position similar to that. It’s a faceless, nameless guy right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Is that player in the building? There’s guys that have traits, but not consistent enough. ... So that’s to be determined.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Premium positions like left tackle usually require teams to use premium resources, which Roushar acknowledged. He said finding a good enough player there requires “draft capital, or an asset we currently don’t have,” and added, “It’s most likely either through free agency or it’s here in the building.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, not knowing who the Bears could get in free agency next month or in the draft in April, when they’re picking No. 25 in the first round, Roushar said, “We’re going to work with the guys we’ve got and we’re going to make it better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones, a fifth-round pick in 2022 who started 44 games over four seasons, is a pending free agent but unlikely to command big offers. Spotrac projected his market value as a two-year, $9.5 million contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benedet, who was undrafted out of Canada in 2024, is an exclusive-rights free agent who can be brought back cheaply. Amegadjie, a 2024 third-round pick who has one career start, has two seasons left on his rookie contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-bc0001\" name=\"list-bc0001\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, pagination=[{body=[Next Page], href=?p=2, _template=/link/Link.hbs, contentId=null, pianoSectionSlug=null, target=null}], inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, _styledTemplate=/page/list/PageListH.hbs, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, carouselSpeed=null, buttonHoverBgColor=#a91d23, rteHeadingFont=font-1, secondaryColor=#656565, count=20501, hideCategories=true, _template=/page/list/includes/PageList-header.hbs, font3=Arial, font4=Source-serif-4, ctaUrl=null, hideImage=false, suppressPagination=true, footerLinkHoverColor=#d3242c, hideAudioPlayback=false, description=[], showSecondItemMedia=false, listColumns234=null, pullQuoteIcon=[{image=null, narrowImage=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=null}], footerTextColor=#ffffff, title=Latest on the Bears, pageCount=6834, headerSecondaryBgColor=#000000, primaryTextColorInverse=#ffffff, titleColor=null, ampLink=null, listHeaderPosition=null, hideDescriptions=false, showActionBar=true, linkHoverColor=#d3242c, buttonBgColor=#d3242c, ctaTarget=null, anchorId=list-bc0001, promoButtonText=null, backgroundColor=null, headerSecondaryTextColor=#ffffff, listTitleFont=font-2, headlineFont=font-1, promoDescriptionFont=font-3, primaryColor=#d3242c, slimFooter=false, hideHeadline=false, hideDates=true, headerBorderColor=#e9e9e9, ratingCardFont=font-1, titleTarget=null, tableCaptionColor=#626262, items=[{type=Image, publishDate=February 27, 2026 02:00 PM, _styledTemplate=null, anchorId=promo-630000, description=[{items=[What’s next for the 2026 roster and the (whenever) stadium?]}], category=[{items=[Halas Intrigue]}], imageAlignment=null, isFeatured=false, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/halas-intrigue, target=null, primaryMediaType=null, timestamp=1772222407000, ampLink=null, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/halas-intrigue/2026/02/27/bears-scouting-combine-indiana-stadium-podcast-halas-intrigue-nfl, wordCount=60, authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/patrick-finley, jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Bears reporter]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[{items=[Patrick Finley covers the Bears and the NFL for the Sun-Times after previous stops in Arizona, Florida and California.]}], name=[{items=[Patrick Finley]}], media=[{ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=patrick-finley-0.jpg, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/a8/3e/6853c67f16af2c0c2ea207670528/patrick-finley-0.jpg, width=512, height=512}, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/a8/3e/6853c67f16af2c0c2ea207670528/patrick-finley-0.jpg, width=512, height=512}}]}, {name=[{items=[Jason Lieser]}], bio=[{items=[Jason Lieser covers the Chicago Bears for the Chicago Sun-Times.]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, media=[{image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/db/45/4fa7d0e60b81cf16ace05e7c41e9/f5kj4hj-400x400-0.jpg, width=512, height=512}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/db/45/4fa7d0e60b81cf16ace05e7c41e9/f5kj4hj-400x400-0.jpg, width=512, height=512}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=Headshot of Chicago Bears reporter Jason Lieser}], _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/jason-lieser, jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Bears reporter]}]}], audio=[], title=Halas Intrigue podcast: Checking the Bears&amp;#x27;
