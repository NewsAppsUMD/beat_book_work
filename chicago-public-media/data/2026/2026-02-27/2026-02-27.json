      "summary": "<img alt=\"Nazareth's Mia Gage (4) drives toward the basket as the Roadrunners go on to win the class 4A sectional championship at Hinsdale Central, February 26, 2026, Hinsdale, Illinois. | \" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/95f86cc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1200+0+0/resize/840x504!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2Fe6%2F6c68b4dd44888ce69f8567b43ef5%2Fkw-cst-022726-7003.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;As Nazareth celebrated after knocking off Downers Grove North 53-26 on Thursday in Hinsdale to win the 4A sectional championship, its players wandered around the floor, taking turns getting pictures with the championship plaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many of the players, this is old hat as Nazareth is a perennial power. But for freshman Mia Gage, this is her first go-around. When it was her time to clutch that coveted championship, Nazareth fans serenaded her by yelling “Truth!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s amazing,” Gage said of hearing the chants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gage scored 12 points on 6-for-9 shooting with five rebounds and three steals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She has no fear,” said senior forward Stella Sakalas, who totaled 15 points, 11 rebounds and five assists. “Which is exactly what this team needs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter, Gage made two correct reads to pick off passes and take them the other way for easy baskets. Gage, at 6-0, is very athletic and disruptive in passing lanes. She is a rugged and willing rebounder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nazareth (32-3) exploded out of the gate, suffocating the Trojans’ offense and holding them to just four points from senior forward Adysen Fanta in the first quarter. The Roadrunners set the tone on the defense and never relented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were locked in all week,” coach Ed Stritzel said. “They knew that Downers had some shooters, and I thought our defense was just spectacular.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roadrunners held Downers Grove North (30-3) to just seven baskets for the game and scored 23 points off their turnovers. Nazareth also thrived in transition with 24 fast-break points. When Nazareth can score off miscues, its a tough team to beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We talk really well on defense, and it helps so much,” Gage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not always easy being a freshman trying to navigate varsity basketball, particularly against Nazareth’s challenging schedule, but Gage has shown she’s up for the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve learned to play my role well, and we’ve all just played as a team,” Gage said. “And as the games have gone on, we’ve just played so much better together, and I think that’s showing at the right time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior guard Sophia Towne scored 10 points, and senior guard Lyla Shelton added 11. Towne and Sakalas, a BYU commit, are two of the best players in their respective grades, but the Roadrunners are a well-rounded group with multiple threats on the court. Gage’s development throughout the season gives Nazareth another threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Gage] doesn’t play like a freshman,” Stritzel said. “She’s only going to get better and better. She’s a raw talent, and she wants to be great. She’s so long on that wing, and our guards put so much pressure on the ball, and then Mia and Stella played a passing lane . . . it’s a tough defense to play against.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Nazareth celebrated on the court, most of the players knew that there was still work to be done. They still have to win the supersectional game against Waubonsie Valley on Monday to advance in the IHSA state tournament. The Roadrunners haven’t lost since Dec. 30 — to an out-of-state team — and their last loss to an in-state opponent was Dec. 13 against Benet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been preparing for a long time, and we’re just thinking about winning seven games one time [to win the state championship],” Sakalas said. ‘‘[This was] just a team win. We played unselfish basketball, and that’s just what we want.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Heck, the Bulls coach doesn’t even feel the need to grab a sign that reads “Slow Down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His offense can’t afford to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too undersized, too inexperienced in playing with each other, and frankly just not good enough to be a lethal team in half-court sets. So while it would be easier on Donovan if his new-look roster was a bit better conditioned, he’s doing all he can to try and get them there – one mile per hour quicker at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One is you have to look at are they capable of playing that way?” Donovan said, when discussing the need to keep his offensive philosophy intact. “Now, are they conditioned for that? We’re trying to obviously get that done. The other point is if we don’t try and play in transition and play fast, we don’t have enough cohesiveness and chemistry to be this team where, ‘We’re going to out-execute you in the halfcourt.’ “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all the traded pieces that most disrupted what Donovan liked to do on the offensive end, center Nikola Vucevic’s role has been the hardest to try and replicate. Not only because of his skillset as a versatile big, but his IQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of what we did, and the biggest adjustment has been not having Vooch here,” Donovan said. “He was such a facilitator and a pocket player, a guy that can score at different levels, you ran offense through him. That’s taken away some of the package. If we try and play in the halfcourt, one, we don’t have enough (practice) time to work on that execution, and two, the way the league is going you want to play a little faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as the legs hold up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Donovan thinks the likes of Collin Sexton, Rob Dillingham and Anfernee Simons have the ability to play up-tempo basketball, their conditioning says otherwise. What the coach wants to avoid is more injuries than the Bulls already have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s been difficult for me is as much as you want to practice, you have guys coming into here that are playing more minutes now than they did at their prior teams,” Donovan added. “There is a concern medically that we’ve got to be careful that if these guys get ramped up so many minutes that these guys end up going out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Size matters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls’ frontcourt continued to thin out with Patrick Williams now in street clothes with a quad strain. The forward suffered the injury in the loss to Charlotte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His will probably be at least a week,” Donovan said of Williams’ timetable. “It could be longer, although I think they would try and ramp him up and do some more in about a week (after they) can get it to calm down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forward/center Jalen Smith remained sidelined with a calf issue and like Williams was at least a week away from starting to get reconditioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves undersized 6-foot-7 Guerschon Yabusele as the starting center for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Closer look&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Donovan is still figuring out exact roles and combinations for the roster, one player he has already tabbed as having a chance to be an improved defender down this final stretch is Sexton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That hasn’t been the guard’s reputation throughout his career, but Donovan said he felt the skill to do that was there.&lt;/p&gt;",

They were taken No. 1 and 2 overall in the 2015 MLB Draft. They debuted the next year and appeared in that All-Star Futures Game. They played against each other in the 2021 World Series, when Swanson’s Braves beat Bregman’s Astros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before all that, however, they were teammates on the 2014 USA Baseball collegiate national team, setting up a sweet reunion when Bregman signed a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/01/10/cubs-alex-bregman-agree-to-5-year-175-million-deal\"   &gt;five-year deal worth $175 million&lt;/a&gt;  with the Cubs this offseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had so much fun that summer,” Bregman said of that 2014 team. “It's one of those memories in the game that you'll never forget, of going out and competing for your country. So if you asked him, too, we both look super fondly back on that time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both playing SEC baseball, Bregman was LSU’s shortstop, and Swanson was at second base for Vanderbilt that year. They became a double play tandem for the United States’ college squad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's great playing up the middle with somebody who's just a superstar,” Bregman said of Swanson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That team traveled to North Carolina, the Netherlands and Cuba for five different events, playing teams that had traveled from all over the world, including Japan and Chinese Taipei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was my first time playing baseball against different countries and cultures, really,” Swanson said. “So to be able to have that experience was pretty unique and special.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the years went on, Swanson and Bregman kept in touch periodically. They always had “competitive respect for one another,” as Swanson put it. But there wasn’t an opening for them to play together again until last spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bregman’s free agency was dragging on longer than expected. And the Cubs’ third base situation was murky after they included &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2024/12/13/kyle-tucker-trade-cubs-astros\"   &gt;Isaac Paredes in the trade with Houston for right fielder Kyle Tucker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When certain guys are obvious fits for what we want to be, it's not too hard to lobby,” Swanson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swanson’s lobbying fell in line with president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer’s thinking. But &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/02/12/what-alex-bregman-reportedly-signing-with-red-sox-means-for-cubs\"   &gt;Hoyer’s attempt to sign Bregman&lt;/a&gt;, even after convincing ownership to expand the offseason budget, fell short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bregman opted out of his Red Sox contract to hit free agency again this past winter, the Cubs made sure they didn’t whiff again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was pretty cool to share the infield with him [in 2014],” Bregman said. “Now we get to do it again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, both obsessed with winning, they’re intent on pushing this Cubs team deep into the playoffs. And now, a dozen years later, they’re far more polished versions of the players who led the collegiate national team to a 18-8-2 record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think he's someone that is going to be really good for me, just being able to ping thoughts and ideas off of,” Swanson said. “And someone that can help understand me, and me understand him. And us having that dialog with one another is going to be really helpful for, I think, both of us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-listcarousel class=\"PageListE\" data-module data-column-count=3 data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-hide-descriptions=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-c90005\" name=\"list-c90005\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, title=Latest on the Cubs, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, items=[{type=Image, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb/2026/02/26/mlb-umpire-bruce-froemming-who-called-milt-pappas-no-hitter-for-the-cubs-dies-at-age-86, _styledTemplate=null, imageAlignment=null, timestamp=1772154485000, categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/mlb, isFeatured=false, category=[{items=[MLB]}], authors=[{authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/associated-press, name=[{items=[AP]}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, jobTitle=[], _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, bio=[{items=[The Associated Press is an independent, not-for-profit news cooperative headquartered in New York City.

Arichely is one of about 545 students who attend two high schools run by the financially-distressed Aspira Charter School Network. More than 90% of students at the two schools are Latino, more than two-thirds are low income and more than half are English Language Learners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of back-and-forth, Chicago Public Schools officials are telling students that the network does not have the money to make it through the school year and that they should transfer before the start of the last quarter “to safeguard their education stability.\" While there’s debate about whether it is CPS’ fault or Aspira’s, such a mid-year school closing is virtually unheard of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely, like other students, has a long list of concerns and questions about credits, grades, senior events and graduation. But she also has a more emotional worry. She lives far from her current school, Aspira Business and Finance Academy in Avondale, and, if she’s sent to her neighborhood school, she doesn’t think many of her friends will go there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She describes herself as shy and wonders what it will be like to walk into a new school three-quarters of the way into the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think my biggest issue is that I'm going to have to reintroduce myself to people that I don't know,” she said. “Now I'm gonna be all alone, and I'm not gonna have the people that I'm used to having.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-520000\" name=\"image-520000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de9ca2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+50/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fdc%2Febd3caf449508a44aa54b742e089%2Faspiraclosing-260227-16.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9cff274/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+50/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fdc%2Febd3caf449508a44aa54b742e089%2Faspiraclosing-260227-16.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff9e03c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+50/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2Fdc%2Febd3caf449508a44aa54b742e089%2Faspiraclosing-260227-16.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A poster of future events in jeopardy hangs on the door of Jose Torres’ classroom at ASPIRA Business &amp;amp; Finance High School, located at 2989 N.

At the Chicago Board of Education meeting Thursday, CPS officials addressed the students before explaining their decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is not the outcome that anyone hoped for,” said Zabrina Evans, CPS executive director of Innovation and Incubation. “We understand the stress and difficulty of today's news. We understand the uncertainty and disruption that comes with changing schools in the middle of the current school year.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans then explained that getting to this point has been “long and complicated,” but that essentially Aspira, like all charter organizations, agreed to operate a school with the money provided by CPS and that Aspira has not been able to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CPS provides funding and support, and charter operators deliver educational services to students,” she said. Not only has Aspira been unable to prove to the district that it can provide those educational services through June, but the charter operator has failed to turn over an audit and other required financial documents, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also noted that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2025/11/25/cps-to-help-aspira-make-payroll-but-charter-operators-financial-woes-remain\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;CPS has given Aspira $2.25 million in cash advances&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and yet the network still says it needs millions more to pay teachers and staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS is “moving forward with this student transition process… due to the dire situation created by the failure of Aspira to demonstrate financial stability, which places the education of Aspira students at risk,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until Wednesday night, Aspira Chief Executive Director Edgar Lopez seemed hopeful that he could save the schools. He told CPS that he was meeting with a bank to get a bridge loan and looking at fundraising, even a crowdfunding campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But speaking at the board meeting, Lopez blamed CPS for the charter schools’ financial problems. He said charters get 83% of what district-run CPS schools receive, though school district officials refute that figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like charters are stepchildren to CPS,” he said. “Our families pay taxes just like all the rest of the families pay taxes. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lopez has also accused CPS of undermining charter schools through its high school application process by prioritizing sending students to district-run schools. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-960000\" name=\"image-960000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7e0a4fd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/67074ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c0354c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A man wearing glasses and a yellow button-up shirt stands in a classroom.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c0354c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d902c3e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c0354c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F83%2F8eb201a94aeebfe7bda87ae01f16%2Faspiraclosing-260227-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspira’s executive director, Edgar Lopez, spoke with students at Aspira Business &amp;amp; Finance High School on Wednesday.

This year Aspira’s high schools started out with less than 600 students, some 200 less than five years ago. Charter school operators also cite other issues that have added to their financial troubles, including rising labor costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lopez told the board no “irregularities” will be found in Aspira’s finances and that it has had clean audits, but the one for last year is not yet complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pleaded with the board to keep the school intact, even if they remove Aspira management, at least until the end of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If this is for the kids, then worry about the kids,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘We should be celebrating our future’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely and dozens of other students and teachers attended Thursday’s meeting. Some of them assigned blame to Aspira and Lopez, while others said CPS is responsible and should do more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more than anything, they lamented the fact that they were caught in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Walsh, who teaches math at the Business and Finance Academy, cited a study that showed students are more likely to drop out of school, face violence and suffer from depression after a mid-year school closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said teachers like him will figure out how to make it through, but they are worried about the students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need assurances that the students will be looked after and they will face as little fracture as possible,” he said. “CPS needs to give them the dignity of an actionable plan that does not repeat history. This is your responsibility, unless you are resigned to make them another statistic.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students expressed frustration, but they also wanted to know what was going to happen next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Lavelle Turner said he was looking forward to his last season playing on the Aspira baseball team and getting ready to take tests to see if he could get college credit for advanced placement classes. He wanted to know whether he would even be able to play baseball and complete his AP classes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should not have to pay and sacrifice our future,” he said. “We should be celebrating our future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d80000\" name=\"image-d80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bc43a45/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f916013/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70fff7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Aspira Charter School students speak during a school board meeting at Chicago Public Schools in Chicago on Thursday, Feb. 26, 2026. | Talia Sprague/for the Sun-Times\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70fff7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9de36e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/70fff7d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5906x3315+0+227/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc9%2F94%2F136b9652444c9e3ac5d4b0faee12%2Faspiraclosing-260227-38.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspira Charter School students speak during a school board meeting Thursday at Chicago Public Schools in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talia Sprague/Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely is on track to go to Loyola University. But now she is wondering if she will graduate on time and whether the transition will affect her ability to get scholarships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“How would a teacher that doesn't really know who we are write a recommendation letter,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely and other seniors said they were dismayed by the idea that they won’t get to go to senior luncheon, Six Flags and prom with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arichely said she’s built a large group of friends and she looked forward to having fun with them, but if they aren’t at these events, she won’t go. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think I'd feel a bit left out because I don't know anyone, and then I wouldn't feel comfortable going to a place or … participating in an activity without my friends,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior Emilo Zurita said he is concerned that some students won’t even go to a new school, at least for the rest of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've heard them say if Aspira closes, they feel like dropping out because they don't feel safe in another school,” he said. “They'd rather drop out than be in a school where they could get shot or something could happen to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A warning for other charter schools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conrad Timbers-Ausar, CPS’ acting chief portfolio officer, said he is working on a transition plan including a list of high schools near Aspira that will guarantee a seat to the displaced students. He said these schools will have a designated transition coordinator who will do check-ins with students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also will be provided “wraparound services tailored to students needs including mentoring, tutoring, mental health services and more,” he told board members. “They will also be prepared to provide additional items like technology, uniforms and school gear that students may need to be successful in the school. Students will receive CPS bus cards to get safely to and from school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district will make sure that credits transfer and that students are able to complete classes, he said. Students will be given a letter to send to colleges explaining the transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karen Zaccor, a school board member who represents the North Side, said she wants to make sure students can play on spring sports teams. She also instructed CPS officials to look into arranging senior events, like prom and graduation, exclusively for Aspira students, even if they are no longer together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think we need to think outside the box and make sure that those things happen,” she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debby Pope, who represents a different North Side district, called the situation a “terrible experience” and “unfair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she said she hopes this sends a warning to other charters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to behave responsibly,” she said. “You have to have your finances in order. You have to be transparent. You have to turn in your audits. We cannot do this to our children. It is just not okay.”&lt;/p&gt;",

The shop is scheduled to close Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no new owner on deck to take over Pride Cleaners, 558 E. 79th St., meaning there will be one less place for South Siders to get their clothes dry cleaned and tailored. And the closure also creates an uncertain future for one of Chicago's most unique modernist sites: an absolute showstopper of a building with its original sign — neither of which are under city landmark protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We are on the verge of losing [an unofficial] historical landmark,\" Ald. William Hall (6th) said. \"An economic engine, of sorts. And also on the verge of losing a part of our history.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built in 1959, Pride Cleaners was designed by Chicago architect Gerald Siegwart. The space race and postwar modernism were shaping nearly every element of U.S. design then, from tailfins rising from the rear decks of automobiles to the shape of household furnishings and, of course, architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Pride, Siegwart designed a building with a self-supporting hyperbolic paraboloid concrete roof that created an interior free of columns. Chicago largely is a flat-topped city, but Siegwart's roof starts at ground level at two anchor points then shoots heavenward at a radical angle. The design choice gives the cleaners building a base that is almost entirely glass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there's the finishing touch: a parking lot sign that features the cleaner's name on electrified, lozenge-shape letters done-up in Pop Art colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The building and its electric sign — winking and blinking in all its glory — can been seen in the 2001 film \"Ali.\" Will Smith, portraying the boxer, is driving past the cleaners when passersby tell him Malcolm X has been killed. And the cleaners exterior and sign appear in Chance the Rapper's 2025 music video for the tune \"Ride.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Very few commercial neighborhood buildings in our city capture that mid-century spirit and commands one's attention like Pride Cleaners,\" Preservation Chicago Executive Director Ward Miller said. \"The building is reminiscent of futuristic &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/googie-architecture-of-the-space-age-122837470/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Googie architecture&lt;/a&gt;, often seen in cities like Los Angeles but with few surviving examples in Chicago.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pride customer Freddie Macklin, who learned of the cleaners' closing when he visited Thursday, said, \"The building is alright to me.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pride's manager, who asked not to be named, said the new owners — out-of-towners who bought the business last year — told her two weeks ago the Chatham mainstay would be closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"How can you leave something like this?\" she said. \"Just leave it and abandon it.

If he walks away, who knows what's going to happen with it?\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ehman said he will try to find a new owner for Pride. It might also be a good time for the city's Department of Planning and Development to wade in and help find new owners and seek landmarks status for this very special building and sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall said he wants to see the building reused before a landmark designation is pursued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I'd like to see another cleaners there,\" he said. \"You know, what good is a relic without revenue.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

The Sox might not see him again till the last days of spring training, depending on how the defending champions fare in the WBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami was slated to play first base in a Cactus League game against the Dodgers on Thursday before leaving to join teammates in advance of their March 6 WBC opener against Chinese Taipei, but he was scratched in the morning because of general soreness in what the Sox said was a “precautionary” move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”He was a full participant in our camp just ahead of a long flight [Friday] morning,” manager Will Venable said. “I thought it was in his best interest not to play today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami, who signed a two-year, $34 million deal in December, agreed. He took on a heavier workload than most Sox teammates in preparation for the WBC. Fatigue was setting in, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was ramping up at a very high speed,” he said Thursday, citing a tight schedule and daily work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was aggressive,” Venable said. “It’s really important we don’t ask him to do too much here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In four Cactus League games, Murakami was 5-for-13 with two doubles and five strikeouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no long balls in Arizona’s thin air for Murakami, who walloped 246 home runs in eight seasons in Japan, including 56 in 2022. He could get a hero’s welcome in his homeland. In the last WBC in 2023, Murakami swatted a walk-off double against Mexico in the semifinals and a home run against the United States in the championship game in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wants another title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m going to go into every single game to win it, and that’s my fullest goal,” Murakami said. “Go into the batter’s box with every intention of winning it every single game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venable said he’ll root for his new player, “even when he’s playing Team USA. Maybe not Team Japan as much. Just excited to see him do his thing and be tuned in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As first impressions go, Murakami hit one out of the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just loved the person,” Venable said. “His ability to be part of the group, this young group, his personality has been amazing. What really stuck out is we asked him to do things in his training and preparation that are different than what he’s done in the past. For someone [who has such conviction] in his preparation and who takes it so seriously, to be that adjustable has been cool to see. Excited about getting him back in the White Sox uniform again with the season starting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortstop Colson Montgomery said Murakami’s English improved just in recent weeks. He has enjoyed random chats about non-baseball things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had good conversations without his translator, and that shows a lot about him, that he’s willing to learn English a lot for the betterment of the team, for us being able to communicate with him, too,” Montgomery said. “He’s teaching us some words. He’s good. He’s a great addition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dodgers 7, Sox 6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Left-hander &lt;b&gt;Sean Newcomb&lt;/b&gt;, who signed a one-year, $4.5 million free-agent deal, started and allowed two runs and four hits in two innings. He’s being stretched out as a starter but could pitch in a variety of relief roles, as well. Newcomb struck out two, including former Cub &lt;b&gt;Kyle Tucker &lt;/b&gt;to end the second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Second-year catcher &lt;b&gt;Kyle Teel &lt;/b&gt;made an impression. “He’s a real competitor back there; you can see it in his eyes,” Newcomb said. “He’s got bull horns kind of coming at you. He came out with the third hitter. I expected a how-you-feeling type of thing, and he was like, ‘Get in your legs! Let’s go!’ That kind of fired me up. Looking forward to working with him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Shortstop &lt;b&gt;Tanner Murray&lt;/b&gt;, trying to win a job in a utility role, hit his second home run in four games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;b&gt;On deck: &lt;/b&gt;Rangers at Sox, 2:05 p.m. Friday, Glendale, 1000-AM, &lt;b&gt;MacKenzie Gore &lt;/b&gt;vs.&lt;b&gt; Erick Fedde&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Sox at Brewers, 2:10 p.m.

Or consistently making the routine play and occasionally charging in or ranging up the middle to make an exceptional one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people in this clubhouse can have that leadership role,” Montgomery, who turns 24 Friday, said, “but you want to lead by example.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s what manager Will Venable is telling his players. Get out of the batter’s box hard, play hard, don’t take a pitch off or give up an at-bat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And that’s all you can do,” Montgomery said. “And if that's a leadership role, a lot of us have that. That’s what everyone wants to do in here. Play as hard as they can, and the best they can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to recovering from a hitting funk to post an .840 OPS with after he was called up from Triple-A Charlotte for his debut on the Fourth of July, the 6-4 Montgomery, a high school first-round draft pick in 2021, seemed to put questions about whether he belonged at shortstop to rest, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I feel like my defensive confidence is at an all-time high,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to his first step in the field, he attributes his steady defensive play to the focus and intent he alluded to talking about leadership. That starts with his pre-pitch setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because when I’m on time with that and I have the intent and mindset of the ball is being hit to me every single time, it keeps me more locked in and engaged every single play,” Montgomery said. “And makes me feel like I have better range, too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery was ill and sidelined two days this week but quickly got back into the swing of things when he homered on a 3-0 pitch from the Reds’ Lyon Richardson on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After dealing with the disappointment of getting sent out of major league camp  last season, he finds himself entrenched as one of the rebuilding Sox’ higher-profile guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve been on two different ends of it,” he said. “The end where you come in and you try to make the team and you feel like you’ve got all the world, the pressure on you and you come in and you have a lot less pressure to come in and do what you need to do to get yourself ready to play every day. I just feel like this year, in spring, I have a better understanding of what I have to do at the plate and even defensively. Not just in the game, but in my work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery’s offseason work has been apparent to Venable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He came into camp in great shape, really athletic,” Venable said Thursday. “He’s a high-performing athlete, it’s always nice to see those guys lean into that in their offseason work. He did that. It showed up on the field [Wednesday] with some of those plays, coming in. He looks great.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While chatter at SoxFest Live suggested 40 homers in his sophomore season based on what he did in three months as a rookie, well-regarded statistical projection systems like ZiPS and Steamer have Montgomery under 25 homers and 130 games played, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Montgomery will keep his own projections to himself. In any case, it was good to put the first home run in camp on the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It just shows that if I’m committed to my plan, and committed in not trying to cheat to fastballs or try to do too much, that if I just can touch the ball, I can do damage,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListL\" data-module  data-hide-authors=\"true\"

He was 86.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froemming fell just after midnight Tuesday and hit his head on the hardwood floor at his home in Mequon, Wisconsin, and was taken to Ascension Columbia St. Mary's Hospital in Milwaukee, according to Froemming's son, Steven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had brain bleeding that medical personnel could not stop because Froemming was on blood thinners, leading to his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froemming was a semipro baseball player and started his umpiring career in the minor leagues in 1958 at age 18. He worked his way up and joined the National League staff in 1971. He shifted to the unified major league staff in 2000 and retired in 2007 having worked 5,163 games, second at the time to Bill Klem's 5,373. They were both surpassed by Joe West, who worked 5,460 games before retiring in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froemming started his umpiring career at a minor league game in Waterloo, Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I thought I was in heaven — on the ballfield, professional athletes, I was starting my professional career,\" he told The Associated Press days before his retirement. \"But never did you dream at the time, ever even think of going to a big league ballpark, because you had so far to go through the minor leagues to even get a chance.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He concluded that being a good umpire required \"probably being patient with yourself. ... You're going to make mistakes early on.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the most famous of the no-hitters he worked was on Sept. 2, 1972. Milt Pappas of the Cubs retired his first 26 batters and went to a 1-2 count on pinch-hitter Larry Stahl before walking him. Pappas then retired Garry Jestadt on a popup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froemming was behind the plate for three other no-hitters, by Ed Halicki (1975), Nolan Ryan (1981) and José Jiménez (1999). He worked five World Series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he retired, Froemming became a special assistant to MLB's vice president on umpiring,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is survived by his wife, the former Rosemarie Loch, whom he married in 1957; two sons, Steven and Kevin; sister Cathy Seizer; half-brother Johnny Froemming; and two grandchildren.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

who was accompanied by Father Michael Pfleger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We pray for his children and grandchildren,” Cardinal Cupich said from the pulpit. “Let them know that they follow in the footsteps of a man who was a giant for justice. And, in that way, his word will continue to live on well beyond his years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know there's a big hole in their hearts at this moment, and I just wanted to stand in solidarity with them,” Cupich told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That line of his to ‘keep hope alive’ was so important because he understood that hope is different than optimism,” Cupich said. “Optimism is about tomorrow. Hope is about today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside, scores of people waited along Drexel Avenue in the crisp but sunny weather as recordings of Jackson’s speeches blared from speakers. Many chanted “I am somebody” and “keep hope alive,” the signature rallying cries of the late reverend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-dd0000\" name=\"image-dd0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9692965/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/59bc46a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b89516b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"JJREPOSETHURS_260227-18.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b89516b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2c9a7b4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b89516b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6063x3403+0+321/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F20%2Fc4%2F4d49d203405cb1c484f833340b0b%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-18.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flanked by family members, the Rev.

He had a very humorous side, but it was easy to talk with him,” said Holland, 68.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recalled Jackson urging parents to “teach your children how to think.” It was a lesson she said she carried with her into motherhood, passing it down from her children to her grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I will never forget that,” Holland said. “I know that I’ll remember that I am somebody.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-af0000\" name=\"image-af0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/549628b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0000883/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9898ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"DW0A0787.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9898ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a125a5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9898ba9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x718+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F08%2Fae21557b4d92b4abe0a3db66b696%2Fdw0a0787.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwen Holland (left) and Julius Owens were CVS classmates when the Rev.

But she said she will never forget his efforts to fight for human rights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Edwards, 75, said Jackson motivated her as a young girl to go to college, becoming the first person in her family to receive a college degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He taught us that education was the road to success,”  Edwards said. Jackson not only encouraged her to pursue her own education, but also inspired her to lead by example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He said ‘once you get there, don’t forget to look back and bring somebody with you,’” Edwards added. “And that was always our motto, to help somebody along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘We’ve lost a voice’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pastor King James Camper, 60, of Richton Park, said Jackson’s path led him to go into ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He wasn’t traditional,” said Camper, who leads Camper’s Temple Church of God in Christ, in Gary, Indiana. “He was connected to the community and the people, and he connected religion with current events. It’s more than just seeking God but learning to live in this society and fight for rights with God’s help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the eldest attendees was Henry Jones, 93, a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, which Jackson joined in 1960. He said he was “humbled” and at a loss for words as he viewed Jackson and considered his life’s accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve lost a voice, we’ve lost a soldier,” Jones said. “We’ve lost someone who was always on the forefront.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f90000\" name=\"image-f90000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c7ad3cf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6b61b0c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c00782/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mayor Brandon Johnson hugs a supporter outside the Rainbow PUSH Coalition\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c00782/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f58eb21/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c00782/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6684x3751+0+353/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2F52%2Fb2af7d6a46b3bc94d2281f90d2f2%2Fjjreposethurs-260227-48.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayor Brandon Johnson hugs a supporter outside the Rainbow PUSH Coalition as hundreds of mourners pay their respects to Rev.

Privately, his peers say he's even more competitive than he lets on publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while Bedard would never admit it, weeks of watching Team Canada’s Olympic run — which fell just short — while he sat around idly surely lit a fire underneath him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fire was obvious Thursday. In fact, it resembled a blazing inferno. On a night when many of his Hawks teammates looked rusty in a 4-2 loss to the Predators, Bedard singlehandedly generated the majority of his team’s offense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He ripped his 24th goal off a savvy pass from &lt;b&gt;Ryan Greene&lt;/b&gt; in the second period, broke in alone on Predators goalie &lt;b&gt;Justus Annunen&lt;/b&gt; a full three additional times and hunted down loose pucks aggressively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen of the Hawks’ 27 scoring chances occurred with Bedard on the ice. He also took faceoffs for the first time since his Dec. 12 shoulder injury, winning seven of 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s the Connor we’ve seen lots of,” coach &lt;b&gt;Jeff Blashill&lt;/b&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;CONNOR BEDARD WITH A WICKED SHOT 🏒 &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/5GyHI1cSdy\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5GyHI1cSdy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; NHL (@NHL) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/NHL/status/2027205208346927410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 27, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the Hawks let a 2-1 lead in the third period slip away. Predators veteran &lt;b&gt;Ryan O’Reilly &lt;/b&gt;outsmarted Hawks rookie &lt;b&gt;Sam Rinzel&lt;/b&gt; to tip in the game-winning goal with 3:15 left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bedard, striking his usual public humble tone, praised Greene and &lt;b&gt;Andre Burakovsky&lt;/b&gt; for setting him up for “five or six Grade A” chances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s on me to put one more of those in and maybe it’s a different game,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;QB search&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears have found their franchise quarterback in &lt;b&gt;Caleb Williams&lt;/b&gt;, but the Hawks are still searching for their quarterback on the power play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They spread out reps between Rinzel, &lt;b&gt;Artyom Levshunov&lt;/b&gt;,&lt;b&gt; Kevin Korchinski&lt;/b&gt; and veteran &lt;b&gt;Matt Grzelcyk&lt;/b&gt; during the past week of practices. Although Rinzel quarterbacked the top unit Thursday, that job is very much available to claim during the stretch run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got [defensemen] that have shown they’re capable of being power-play guys,” Blashill said. “We’d like to see one or two guys grab it and show they’re elite at it. There’s a difference there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levshunov &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/01/30/blackhawks-artyom-levshunov-reset-break-foundational-skills-jeff-blashill\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;returned to the lineup&lt;/a&gt; Thursday and quarterbacked the second unit.

They worked on an entry with two drop passes and another entry with zero, where the initial puck-carrier sneaks into the zone on his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both new entries were on display during a successful third-period power play. A zero-drop entry by &lt;b&gt;Frank Nazar&lt;/b&gt; created one extended zone sequence. A minute later, a two-drop entry back to Bedard created another extended sequence culminating in a &lt;b&gt;Tyler Bertuzzi&lt;/b&gt; goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I like that [two-drop entry] where I can get that much speed and come in,” Bedard said. “I feel pretty confident about it when I have those gaps.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Extra attacker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks haven’t practiced six-on-five situations (with the goalie pulled) much this season, but they finally did Monday. They converted a couple times in practice, so it’ll be interesting to see if that makes a difference down the stretch. They’re the only NHL team with zero goals in those situations. They came up empty again Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Only one&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defenseman &lt;b&gt;Wyatt Kaiser&lt;/b&gt; is the Hawks’ lone injured player. He has resumed skating individually as he works his way back from a Feb. 4 knee injury and could return to action next week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The Bulls hold Portland’s lottery-protected first-round pick, but only if the Blazers make the playoffs. Otherwise, it carries over for another year through 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the red corner was the coach from Rockville Centre, New York, who continues spending long nights in the office trying to figure out how he can help will this mishmash of a roster to a victory. Billy Donovan doesn’t know any other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something had to give.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 11th consecutive time, it was Donovan and the roster he has been given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of another high-turnover game — 20 in this one — the Bulls (24-36) stumbled to the worst month in franchise history with an 0-11 February, losing 121-112.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls got 20 points from Matas Buzelis, but even he wasn’t great on a 6-for-16 shooting night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that Karnisovas &amp;amp; Co. should have minded much. Portland’s win kept the Blazers in the No. 9 spot for the play-in, still trying to close in on the No. 8 Warriors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while Donovan wasn’t looking to offer a helping hand in that, he also wasn’t oblivious to the entire situation, especially with the prospect of adding a second first-round pick in a loaded class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The discussions I had with them when the trade deadline was finalized was, ‘Nothing has changed, try and get these guys to play to the best of their ability; we know it’s going to be somewhat challenging with seven new players,’ ’’ Donovan said. “Even talking to ownership, it’s been, ‘Hey, go out there and do your very best.’ There has been no indication from ownership or the front office of, ‘Hey, listen, if we finish here, here or here’ or ‘Listen, don’t worry about playing these guys; just play these guys.’ There’s been none of that at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Philosophically, I get the dynamics once June, whatever date that draft date is, I get how that impacts all of that. It’s not like I’m sitting over there saying, ‘Well, it’s a close game right now, let’s sit Josh [Giddey] and Tre [Jones] and Jalen [Smith].’ There has not been that. And I think if I did do that, they would say, ‘Listen, you need to put the best guys out there.’ ’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a nice idea for Donovan to hold on to, but with the pressure the front office is starting to feel, it’s not in its best interests to play the “best guys” at this point. It made sure of that by trading some of the team’s better guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Donovan needed a reminder of that, it came in the last minutes after a dunk by Leonard Miller cut the deficit to three with 3:37 left. Rather than build off that and continue the rally, the Bulls’ defense fell apart. Donovan’s squad was outscored 13-7 to close the game out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the third-longest losing streak in franchise history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not making excuses; we don’t think we’re 11-game-losing-streak bad,” forward Isaac Okoro said. “At this point, we just have to come to the game focused and do the little things right. Blocking out, not turning the ball over, not letting them get second-chance points. Just doing the little things, and we can win games.”&lt;/p&gt;",

For the last eight years, I have been in a relationship with an amazing woman. She has always had some control issues, but because of the love we share, I was able to look past them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've always been the one who paid for everything. I recently had some heart issues and was unable to work my part-time job, so my income was reduced. I was no longer able to continue to do the things she was used to. She recently retired and wants to do more traveling, which, at this time, I can't afford. This has caused friction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I put a ring on her finger, which she accepted with reservation, telling me she never wanted to get married or live together. She likes things the way they are. She recently told me she's no longer in love with me the way she had been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to think badly of her, but I think it's because of my health and financial issues. This hurts so bad. For some reason, I still love her and can't move on. I'm a hopeless romantic and a true gentleman. I'm gun-shy about trying again at 70, but I hate being alone and depressed. What do you suggest? — &lt;i&gt;DISILLUSIONED IN NEW JERSEY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR DISILLUSIONED:&lt;/b&gt; I am sorry you are depressed and hurting. From what you have written, I can only conclude that when you were paying for everything, your ladylove liked the ride she was on. Now that things have changed financially, she has jumped off, so to speak. You may not believe this right now, but you are lucky she has shown her true colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do not have to stay alone and depressed. You also do not have to participate in relationships that are all give and no take. With this in mind, look for women who are independent and willing to share some of the financial costs of a relationship. You may be surprised to find that there are many out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; My wealthy uphill neighbor and I share a retaining wall, which has been damaged by her reckless irrigation practices. Since the damage can be seen only from my side, she's not concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An inspector recommended excavating on her side to allow waterproofing the wall and installing a drainpipe. I wanted to bring in a wall contractor to get an estimate, but she would not allow it. Evidently, she doesn't want any of the plants in her backyard disturbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, she notified me by certified mail that she would no longer communicate with me. The city says it doesn't get involved in beefs between neighbors. I'm at my wits' end. Any advice? — &lt;i&gt;HOG-TIED IN CALIFORNIA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR HOG-TIED:&lt;/b&gt; Because water causes erosion, it is only a matter of time before your property is affected by your neighbor's drainage. She may have sent you that certified letter on advice from her lawyer. This is why you now need to engage legal counsel of your own. She's a difficult person, and you need to protect yourself and your property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

Schakowsky has endorsed Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss in the race, while Davis is trying to pass the baton to State Rep. LaShawn Ford, D-Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no wave of candidates clamoring for “Chuy” Garcia’s seat, though, mostly because the longtime Southwest Side congressman didn’t publicly announce he was retiring for health reasons until the end of the candidate filing period last fall. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2025/11/06/patty-garcia-chief-of-staff-jesus-chuy-garcia-successor-march-primary-congress\"   &gt;Patty Garcia, &lt;/a&gt;the congressman’s chief of staff, is the lone Democrat on the primary ballot.

U.S. Reps. Mike Quigley, elected in 2009, and Rep. Bill Foster, elected in 2013, likely will become the most senior members of the delegation. Rep. Mike Bost, elected in 2015, is poised to  become the most senior member of Illinois’ Republican delegation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cook County’s heated rivalries&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longtime Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle is aiming to prevent any turnover in the office she’s held since 2010.

Brendan Reilly (42nd), who has criticized the length of her tenure and slammed growing county budgets. Preckwinkle calls him President Donald “Trump’s man in Chicago.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same goes for Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi, who is trying to hold on for a third term over opposition from the Preckwinkle-led Cook County Democratic Party, which is endorsing his challenger, Lyons Township Assessor Patrick Hynes.&lt;/p&gt;",

The goal is to get them to change what they're doing, to do better, to not enable these companies anymore.

Neither company responded to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Smith &amp;amp; Wesson’s a tiny little company with like a $300 million market cap. It's not not driving KPMG's business,” Perlman said. “It's remarkable that these CEOs and managing partners don't see the bigger picture here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With enough scrutiny, Jacobs said, “enough people are going to change auditors because of it, and that's going to affect them, and maybe then they'll do the right thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Perlman wants to target recruiters who he thinks will have trouble attracting talent in the next generation of corporate leaders. “I think we're going to be very successful in changing minds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the average consumer isn’t dealing with global accounting firms — or any of the machinery and industrial suppliers flagged in project’s latest tranche of alleged enablers — &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.hppeaceproject.org/scorecard/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;their website&lt;/a&gt; puts more familiar names on blast, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walmart gets dinged for online weapons sales, along with FedEx and UPS for delivering them. The same goes for major sporting good companies like Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s, which didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walmart, which stopped selling AR-15-style rifles in 2015 and halted sales of ammunition for military-style weapons in 2019, says on its website that \"our heritage as a company has always been in serving sportsmen and hunters, and we plan to continue to do so in a responsible way.\" The company doesn't sell handguns either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also listed as an \"enabler\" is Amazon, which prohibits firearm sales but carries other products from companies that produce guns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perlman said the Peace Project has gotten muted responses from companies notified that they had landed on the database of “enablers,” with some law firms and businesses privately pleading to be removed and others standing firmly with their clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endorsed by the nonprofit research group are Costco and REI, which have shunned weapon manufacturers, as well as Apple Pay and PayPal, which don’t allow their platforms to be used for gun or ammunition purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacobs and Perlman rate dozens more companies across the finance, tech and manufacturing industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People want to do something and people don't know what to do, people at all levels, everyday consumers like you and me as well as high-powered decision makers at corporations,” Jacobs said. “Everyone who cares about this issue, everyone who cares about their children and wants to do something — this is such an easy thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;",

Commercial value has been dropping as large businesses and wealthy land owners appeal assessments at higher rates — and more successfully — shifting more of the burden onto  low income home owners,

He said circuit breaker laws would be costly and could be avoided had the assessment stayed on track with market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He admits there are “no magic beans,” but said the office has an \"embarrassment of riches” when it comes to tools at its disposal to improve the system.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are causing real harm to people at times when we get it wrong,” Hynes said. “Even in a hot market, we don’t have that kind of wild adjustment in value.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaegi’s early tenure saw some positive change. Christopher Berry, a professor of public policy at University of Chicago and director of the school’s Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation, said Kaegi has reduced overassessments for lower value homes and underassessments on higher value homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a break from former assessor Joe Berrios, whose assessment methods often favored wealthier property owners and allowed them to pay less in property taxes than those in low-income and minority communities. One of Kaegi’s first moves was adopting a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://prodassets.cookcountyassessoril.gov/s3fs-public/page_comm/ExecutiveOrder.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;new code of ethics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f70000\" name=\"image-f70000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9ad141a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1f%2Fe4%2F7476cc5445eebfab6b0e94c53314%2Fwtkassessor-260206-12-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1a8a9b4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1f%2Fe4%2F7476cc5445eebfab6b0e94c53314%2Fwtkassessor-260206-12-1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a583d16/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x3436+0+324/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1f%2Fe4%2F7476cc5445eebfab6b0e94c53314%2Fwtkassessor-260206-12-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Lyons Township Assessor Pat Hynes speaks about why he is running for Cook County Assessor at IBEW Local 134 at 2722 S.

People are seeing their taxes go up regardless of the fact that the assessments are more fair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hynes has touted cracking down on properties that have undergone construction that he says the assessor’s office has missed, including properties in his own jurisdiction. He wants to expand field inspector teams and use AI tools on satellite imagery to better identify new construction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You assess according to the law and the market, it should move at a slow, predictable pace,” Hynes said. “Think of the buildings that weren’t built because they were chased away by an erratic property tax system... If they don’t build it, we can’t tax it, and then we can’t spread that burden around to provide relief for taxpayers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/how-to-vote-illinois-primary\"   &gt;How to cast your ballot in the March 2026 Illinois primary&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/what-to-know-democratic-primary-cook-county-assessor-fritz-kaegi-pat-hynes\"   &gt;What to know about the Democratic primary race for Cook County assessor&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/06/cook-county-board-president-democratic-primary-what-to-know-preckwinkle-reilly\"   &gt;What to know about the Democratic primary for Cook County board president&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kaegi has shot back about Hynes taking contributions from property tax lawyers. Campaign finance records show Hynes has taken nearly $70,000 from at least 43 different lawyers employed by firms providing property tax services, or the firms themselves, since Sept. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes nearly $10,000 from lawyers at Worsek and Vihon, a property tax law firm that boasts it led to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wvproptax.com/recent-decisions/#\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;recent reductions of more than $3 million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for several Cook County properties, according to campaign contribution data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaegi took a $1,032 donation from a lawyer at Kirkland &amp;amp; Ellis, which provides tax dispute services for clients. Lawyers at the firm also donated $7,500 to Hynes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hynes has pointed to the tens of thousands of dollars Kaegi has taken from developers, construction companies and others in the real estate field — including $25,000 from investor Stephen Schuler at Wicklow Capital and $5,000 from K&amp;amp;J Builders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the challenger has also taken nearly $60,000 alone from those involved with 150 N. Riverside, a property along the riverfront  which saw its last appeal to the assessor’s office shut down in 2018 — the year Kaegi took office. David Carlins, CEO of Magellan Development, a luxury rental and condo developer who has worked on projects such as the St. Regis skyscraper, also dropped $40,000 on Hynes’ campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a very wide swath of support for the campaign, including those active in the real estate market,” Hynes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-3a0000\" name=\"module-3a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Illinois 2026 primary election schedule&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Feb. 5&lt;/b&gt;: Early voting and vote by mail begins&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 1&lt;/b&gt;: Online voter registration ends, but voters may register in person at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.elections.il.gov/VotingAndRegistrationSystems/EarlyVotingLocationsSearch.aspx\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;election authority and early voting sites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 12&lt;/b&gt;: Deadline for online and posted applications to vote by mail; in-person requests for absentee ballots may be made through March 16&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 17&lt;/b&gt;: Polls open for Primary Election Day from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 31&lt;/b&gt;: Deadline to return absentee ballots postmarked on or before Primary Election Day&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/08/04/cook-county-assessor-misclassifies-hundreds-of-properties/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/01/17/senior-freeze-property-tax-exemption-fritz-kaegi-armando-saleh-cook-county-assessor-jill-fitzgerald\"   &gt;City Hall lobbyist pays $96,000 for tax breaks Sun-Times showed he never should have been given&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2024/11/15/senior-freeze-property-tax-fritz-kaegi-cook-county-assessor\"   &gt;Fritz Kaegi OK’d tax breaks for ‘low-income’ seniors, now demands proof they qualify amid Sun-Times probe&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/7/8/23199200/property-tax-breaks-exemptions-errors-cook-county-assessor-fritz-kaegi-barbara-kaplan-israel-martin\"   &gt;Pay up, Cook County orders homeowners after Sun-Times exposed wrongful property tax breaks&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/05/23/fritz-kaegi-cook-county-assessor-wrongful-tax-breaks-erroneous-exemptions-walter-burnett\"   &gt;Cook County assessor gave $930,000 in wrongful tax breaks, then waived penalties, interest over its errors&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

She was buried in south suburban Glenwood alongside her mother — also an influential music teacher on the South Side, where Bonds grew up and spent her early career. Despite her stature in American music history, however, Bonds’ own grave is unmarked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will soon change. This weekend, Northwestern University — Bonds’ alma mater — hosts a ceremony and performance dedicating a new headstone. A rendering of the marker will be shown to the public, then installed later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malcolm J. Merriweather, a specialist in Bonds’ music who leads the New York Philharmonic Chorus, says it came to his attention that the late composer did not have a headstone during a conversation with her great-niece last year. Along with Bonds’ descendant, Merriweather used his personal funds to pay for the headstone outright, which included proceeds from his own arrangements of Bonds’ music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think a characteristic of Black life is making sure those who have gone before us are taken care of,” Merriweather said. “We both decided that we were going to make it happen for this incredible composer, educator, pianist and performer that has inspired so many of us in our careers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-c20000\" name=\"image-c20000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1278ad0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F6f%2Fcb35e4cb4f6892cdff9f6e530ba9%2Fbondsmusic-2602270177.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2344214/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F6f%2Fcb35e4cb4f6892cdff9f6e530ba9%2Fbondsmusic-2602270177.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df205c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F6f%2Fcb35e4cb4f6892cdff9f6e530ba9%2Fbondsmusic-2602270177.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Sidney Jackson Jr., President and CEO of Chicago Sinfonietta poses for a portrait along the Chicago River in downtown Chicago on February 26, 2026. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df205c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F6f%2Fcb35e4cb4f6892cdff9f6e530ba9%2Fbondsmusic-2602270177.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2d04959/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F6f%2Fcb35e4cb4f6892cdff9f6e530ba9%2Fbondsmusic-2602270177.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df205c8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+433/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F6f%2Fcb35e4cb4f6892cdff9f6e530ba9%2Fbondsmusic-2602270177.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s always been Sinfonietta’s mission to champion composers and artists of color as well as women.

The Sinfonietta has championed Bonds’ music, most recently her “Montgomery Variations,” composed after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. According to Jackson, many musicians participating in this weekend’s concert are donating their time for the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's always been Sinfonietta’s mission to champion composers and artists of color as well as women. To honor Margaret Bonds’ legacy with this project was a natural fit,” Jackson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort recalls a similar one to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://weta.org/fm/classical-score/weta-classical-listener-installs-grave-marker-florence-price\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;install a marker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the grave of composer &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/curious-city/2022/07/21/who-was-florence-price\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Florence Price&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who provided essential mentorship to Bonds as a fellow Black female composer living on Chicago’s South Side. Price is also buried in the south Chicago suburbs, at Lincoln Cemetery in Blue Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonds studied at Chicago Musical College before enrolling at Northwestern University at just 16. After getting a bachelor’s and master’s at Northwestern, she pursued further study at The Juilliard School in New York City. She lived and worked there as well as Los Angeles, where she died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonds’ years at Northwestern were unhappy ones. She was not permitted to live or practice piano on campus, like her white peers. She sought refuge at the Evanston Public Library, whose basement bookshelves became something of an escape. There, she stumbled upon Langston Hughes’ “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was in this prejudiced university, this terribly prejudiced place,” she reflected later, “and I know that poem helped save me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hughes would become her most important collaborator and a dear friend. She frequently set his writing to music, including “The Ballad of the Brown King,” which CBS featured in a 1960 Christmas broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQE-S3b4FA0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"The Ballad of the Brown King: I.

Before she retired in 2023, Montgomery kept a picture of Bonds in her office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I think of anyone who looks like me going to a historically white institution in the 1930s, I just think it's amazing,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Friday’s dedication concert at Northwestern’s Pick-Staiger Concert Hall will feature Chicago Sinfonietta musicians, as well as guest singers. The Kenwood United Church of Christ will host a panel with Bonds performers and researchers the following day. Both are free and open to the public.

Jan Schakowsky’s seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen, an economist from Evanston, says he staunchly supports the U.S.-Israel alliance and was interested in hearing from the group that has championed that cause for decades. At the same time, he does not believe U.S. military aid to Israel should be a blank check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting was at a coffee shop and lasted an hour. Cohen says he expressed support for Israel but “probably sounded like someone who was going to take a very hard look” at the country’s “behavior” in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen never heard back from AIPAC. Then he noticed a deluge of donations from around the country for another candidate — a state senator who had not called for stricter conditions on aid to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen is among several Democrats in four wide-open Chicago-area congressional primaries to have met with AIPAC and learned the group has drawn a hard line on one thing: unconditional U.S. military aid to Israel. The topic has become a flashpoint for candidates and voters as more Democrats call for improving human rights in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC donors and affiliates have spent more than $10.6 million on the group’s preferred candidates in the four races, a WBEZ analysis of federal campaign disclosures found. Those candidates, meantime, have evaded most questions, or favored Israel, in a WBEZ survey about U.S. support for Israel and the war in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WBEZ surveyed the 46 candidates in the Chicago area’s four hard-fought Democratic congressional primaries about whether there should be strict U.S. conditions on military aid to Israel, whether that country has committed genocide in Gaza, and whether AIPAC funding should be off-limits in these races.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the respondents said yes to those questions, but the four AIPAC-aligned candidates would not answer yes or no.&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big campaign spending isn’t new for AIPAC, which has been around for 72 years. But the group is operating more covertly than ever, Democratic strategists say. AIPAC is working through newly formed political action committees that are hard to trace and that bankroll campaign mailers, phone calls and TV commercials. So far, that publicity hasn’t mentioned the Middle East, focusing instead on things like immigration and affordability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC has not responded to WBEZ questions about its candidate selection criteria or Chicago-area tactics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re trying to influence these elections … by invoking other issues that have nothing to do with Israel,” says veteran political consultant David Axelrod, who was chief strategist and senior advisor to President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t unusual in American politics,” he adds. “But given the volatility of issues involving Israel now, it’s conspicuous in this case that they’re working so hard to submerge their own participation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Secretive spending&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIPAC-linked candidates — all Democrats — include Cook County Commissioner Donna Miller in the 2nd District, Chicago City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin in the 7th, former U.S. Rep. Melissa Bean in the 8th and state Sen. Laura Fine in the 9th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC is supporting them in two main ways. The first is steering AIPAC donors to the candidates through online fundraisers, in-person events and email solicitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, 1,726 donors to AIPAC or its main super PAC had contributed to at least one of the four candidates by the start of the year, according to the WBEZ analysis. Of those donors, 1,524 (88.3%) lived outside Illinois and nearly a third contributed to more than one of the candidates. The AIPAC-linked donations totaled nearly $2.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates receiving those donations have depicted the link to AIPAC as a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second way AIPAC has propelled the Chicago-area candidates is through super PACs, which cannot donate directly to candidates or coordinate with them but can raise and spend unlimited sums on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC-tied super PACs have spent more than $7.7 million on TV ads, phone outreach and mailers for the four candidates, according to federal filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC, a national lobbying organization with more than 6 million members, tries to ensure U.S. policies and public perception favor Israel. The group spends big on Republican and Democratic candidates alike and aggressively targets Israel critics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But AIPAC over the years has fallen out of favor with some Democrats and Jewish progressives who have recoiled from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s tactics in Gaza and from AIPAC’s backing of Republicans who &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/aipac-pro-israel-group-backs-insurrectionist-republicans\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;voted to overturn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the 2020 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois’ two-term Democratic governor, JB Pritzker, believes AIPAC has “abandoned their principles.” Pritzker, the state’s third Jewish governor, was a driving force behind construction of the Illinois Holocaust Museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just because they donate to certain Democrats doesn’t change the fact that they are heeding the words and direction of Jared Kushner and other Trump acolytes,” Pritzker campaign spokesman Alex Gough said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker is not alone with that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s no question they’re right-wing,” says Steve Sheffey, who writes the Jewish newsletter The Fine Print and was an AIPAC member for 25 years. “They wouldn’t think of themselves as that, but they are right-wing on the issue that they advocate for, and also right-wing in who they support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Axelrod says that reputation has pushed AIPAC to operate “under the cloak of darkness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Younger Jews who aren’t as steeped in [Israeli] history may have been horrified by what happened on Oct. 7 but then were horrified by what followed,” Axelrod says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamas killed more than 1,200 people during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack in Israel, according to Israeli officials. More than 72,000 Palestinians have been killed since, according to Gaza health officials. Some died during a food shortage that a U.N. panel declared was a famine. A slew of human rights groups have concluded Israel has committed genocide in Gaza — a finding that Israel denies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC has shown interest in Chicago-area Democratic congressional primaries that seem to be wide open after the retirement of longtime incumbents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With these four districts, where it can be anybody’s game, they’re heavily invested,” says Nick Sous, an organizer with the U.S. Palestinian Community Network, which is critical of AIPAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC has a chance in three of the races to replace incumbents increasingly critical of weapons sales to Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Robin Kelly, who is stepping down to run for retiring U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin’s seat, and retiring Reps. Danny Davis and Schakowsky signed onto the “Block the Bombs” bill last year. The measure would place more stringent human rights conditions on the sale of certain weapons — like bunker-busting bombs that can tear through concrete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re trying to force a power shift,” says Sous, whose group has pushed Illinois politicians to sign onto the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shell PACs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newly formed super PACs with ties to AIPAC cropped up in January, joining the United Democracy Project, which has been active for four years and is throwing its weight behind Conyears-Ervin in the race for the 7th District, which stretches from the western suburbs to some Downtown and South Side areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The websites of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://affordablechicagonow.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Affordable Chicago Now&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://electchicagowomen.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Elect Chicago Women&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; include no information about Bean, Fine or Miller and no mention of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The committees’ ties to AIPAC and UDP aren’t obvious. But a WBEZ review of federal and state disclosures found the groups identifying shared registered agents and vendors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their TV commercials and mailers have contained no reference to Israel. They have focused on domestic issues such as health care and immigration enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither ACN nor ECW responded to WBEZ questions on why the groups have poured millions of dollars into Fine, Miller and Beans’ candidacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2nd Congressional District, which covers part of the South Side and some nearby suburbs and rural areas, Miller is among 11 Democratic candidates vying to replace Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to nearly $1.5 million in super PAC spending, Miller has received a huge amount directly from AIPAC donors. They accounted for more than 72% of her $1.3 million in total receipts at the start of the year, according to the WBEZ analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-100000\" name=\"html-embed-module-100000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27812440\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27812440/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 578, or 65%, of her individual donors had contributed to AIPAC or UDP, the analysis shows. Of those, 515 (89%) lived outside Illinois. Since 2021, those donors and their immediate family members had given more than $28.5 million to the two PACs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Miller leans into a technical truth: “AIPAC has not given me any campaign contributions,” she told WBEZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a forum this month, Miller said she had received funds from a “broad base.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think that money coming into your campaign decides how you’re going to legislate, how you’re going to effectuate change in your district,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller’s campaign this week circulated a letter from Jewish leaders, including U.S. Rep. Brad Schneider and Chicago Ald. Debra Silverstein, that paints AIPAC’s role in the race as “Jewish engagement” and warns that criticizing the engagement “risks reinforcing harmful narratives at a time when antisemitism is rising.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Miller’s AIPAC support led to her &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/02/19/rep-jan-schakowsky-withdrawal-donna-miller-endorsement-2nd-congressional-district-aipac-support\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;losing Schakowsky’s endorsement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this month. The longtime congresswoman, who is Jewish, said Illinois “deserves leaders who put voters first, not AIPAC.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ground skirmishes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC’s role is drawing fire from progressive candidates, especially in the 9th Congressional District, which stretches from the North Side to several northern and northwestern suburbs. The district is home to many Israelis and Palestinians, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which doesn’t track religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that primary, federal campaign finance records show, Elect Chicago Women has shelled out $1.4 million for Fine, the state senator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine has also landed huge sums of AIPAC-tied cash. At least 987, or 67%, of her individual donors by the start of this year had contributed to AIPAC or UDP, the WBEZ analysis shows. Of those, 851 (86%) lived outside Illinois. The AIPAC-linked donors accounted for 73% of her $1.9 million in total receipts. Since 2021, the donors and their immediate family members have given more than $46 million to those pro-Israel committees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has become an issue for Fine in recent weeks. At a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://x.com/DanielBiss/status/2024672880714301700?s=20\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;forum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, candidates were handed signs with “yes” on one side and “no” on the other and asked a series of single-answer questions. When the moderator queried the group about whether they accepted money from AIPAC or its supporters, Fine was the only candidate among six on-stage to hold up a “yes” sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss posted video of the moment on his X account and drew nearly 22,000 views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She supports a blank check of military aid for Israel,” said Biss, who is Jewish and frequently talks up his ties to Israel but increasingly criticizes its actions. “That is a right-wing policy that is bad for Palestinians, Jews, Israelis, America and the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine, also Jewish, hit back, saying Biss himself took AIPAC-connected money in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elect Chicago Women last weekend unveiled its first negative TV ad against Biss, accusing him of “saying anything to get elected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-810000\" name=\"html-embed-module-810000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27815367\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27815367/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 8th Congressional District, which covers some western and northwestern suburbs, Bean is among candidates hoping to replace Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who is running for Durbin’s Senate seat. She has benefited from $2.6 million in AIPAC-linked super PAC spending and, by the start of the year, her campaign had received more than a half-million dollars from AIPAC donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 314, or 57%, of Bean’s individual donors have also contributed to AIPAC or UDP since 2021, the WBEZ analysis shows. Of those, 272 (87%) lived outside Illinois. Those donors accounted for more than 39% of her $1.3 million in total receipts by the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a news conference focused on AIPAC spending, Bean rival Junaid Ahmed accused her of selling her candidacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Melissa Bean will take their millions and then rubber stamp billions in unchecked military aid to Israel. Melissa Bean will look the other way as Israel commits a genocide,” said Ahmed, a director at a cloud computing firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to WBEZ’s survey, Bean declined to provide yes-or-no answers but added, “I support a two-state solution in the Middle East that allows both Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace, safety and dignity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-f50000\" name=\"html-embed-module-f50000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27815247\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27815247/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC has also been accused of parachuting into majority-Black areas where, candidates say, U.S.-Israel relations are not a top concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re not investing in our schools. They’re not supporting the marginalized,\" said Anthony Driver, who is running to replace Davis. “The 7th District is not for sale. My community is not for sale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peters, a 2nd District candidate, stood with Driver at the AIPAC-focused news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m Black and Jewish and … AIPAC is not my friend,” Petershe said. “[I]t gets conflated that AIPAC is about Jewish safety. I want to dissuade that. It is about Israel. Jewish safety comes through solidarity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Choosing favorites&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A whopping 46 Democrats are running across the four congressional primaries. Most respondents to the WBEZ survey showed support for Palestinian rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than two-thirds of respondents answered they would denounce AIPAC funding if offered. Two-thirds said they support strict human rights conditions on aid to Israel. More than half said they believe Israel has committed genocide in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four AIPAC-linked candidates were among a minority of respondents who declined to provide yes-or-no answers to a majority of questions. Conyears-Ervin did answer one question with a straightforward answer, saying she would not oppose sending U.S. military aid to Israel today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some primary contenders say AIPAC has a litmus test for choosing whom to back: Does the candidate support unconditional U.S. aid to Israel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A “no” answer is disqualifying, according to candidates in the 2nd, 8th and 9th districts who took meetings with either AIPAC or the United Democracy Project, the group’s super PAC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Rep. La Shawn Ford, D-Chicago, another candidate running to replace Davis, met with AIPAC late last year at a community graduation in his district. The AIPAC representative stressed the effect of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel, telling Ford, “You have to remember that date,” the candidate recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford’s impression was that AIPAC would support candidates only if they oppose the “Block the Bombs” bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIPAC contact, whom Ford would not identify, eventually called him with news that the group would instead support Conyears-Ervin “and that they’re going to come out hard for her,” Ford recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIPAC’s spending has been most transparent in that race, where it is supporting Conyears-Ervin to the tune of $1.5 million through the UDP, whose donors through December have been disclosed. AIPAC’s role in that district, the 7th, has also evolved. At first, its donors were showering hundreds of thousands of dollars on River North developer Jason Friedman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a message to WBEZ, Conyears-Ervin responded to accusations that AIPAC’s support would influence her voting in Congress: “The idea that a Black woman’s vote is for sale is insulting and racist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-900000\" name=\"html-embed-module-900000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-chart\" data-src=\"visualisation/27813578\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27813578/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Sen. Willie Preston, D-Chicago, running to replace Kelly in the 2nd, also spoke with AIPAC but says it seemed the group sought “100% control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The problem with AIPAC is that they are looking for slaves,” says Preston, chair of the Illinois Senate Black Caucus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither AIPAC nor UDP responded to requests for comment about the alleged litmus test, but UDP spokesperson Patrick Dorton described it to the Jewish Telegraph this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going to have a focus on stopping candidates who are detractors of Israel or who want to put conditions on aid,” Dorton said.&lt;/p&gt;",

With the progress, the team hosted a few small-scale concerts and opened the doors to public tours during the Chicago Architecture’s Open House weekend that year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there were challenges in closing the gap on the additional funding needed. Because Double Door had not been active for years, with no recent tax records or revenue, it was considered a new business, which can be viewed as high-risk to some lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d50000\" name=\"image-d50000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f008622/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1c%2F36%2F56bedee34673a82a0205d2e831c3%2Fmulroney-031222-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/11c826d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1c%2F36%2F56bedee34673a82a0205d2e831c3%2Fmulroney-031222-2.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/402a961/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1c%2F36%2F56bedee34673a82a0205d2e831c3%2Fmulroney-031222-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Sean Mulroney, owner of Double Door sits inside the location of the new double door which is inside an old bank building at 1050 West Wilson Avenue, in the Uptown neighborhood, Friday, March 11, 2022.

Access to the $5 million grant eventually expired, and the team worked “down to the wire” to try to find alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's a shame because it’s a stunning facility. But the thing is, with these old theaters, they're really, really expensive to redo,” he said. “While the inside would have been spectacular, the size would only have been a little bit bigger than the [original] Double Door in terms of capacity, except the cost was exponentially more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That meant he’d be looking to book programming on at least five and up to seven nights a week to even try to break even, but it wasn’t a sustainable plan. “There’s competition — less people are touring and less people are buying tickets,” Mulroney said. “And given the climate we are in economically and the change in behavior of young folks who can’t afford to always go out and are drinking less, the amount to redo a historic building for that purpose was not feasible financially.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Double Door setback comes at the same time that another historic venue revival is gaining traction. On Feb. 21, Ald. Daniel La Spata (1st), posted a&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2698590633837486\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;video on social media&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; previewing “a new era” for the Congress Theater, which has been closed since 2013. It comes after developers secured a&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/city-hall/2026/01/14/landmark-congress-theater-federal-loan-preservation-finance-committee-city-council\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;$25 million federal loan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; backed by city funds. Unlike the indie Double Door, though, the Congress has considerable corporate backing as it is operated by AEG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wish the city would look at us and go, you’re bringing 62 jobs and $8 million in revenue to this community every year, maybe we can give you a hand a little more than the $5 million,” he countered. “But at some point, the little guys can't afford it and I'm a little guy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same lack of access to funding amid inflated costs has been affecting bottom lines for a number of independent entertainment venues across the city; as Sun-Times &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/music/2026/02/03/chicago-indie-venues-health-metro-ramova-salt-shed\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;recently reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, only one in four is currently profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Mulroney has not given up hope. He still plans to bring Double Door back to life in a new spot in the near future, given a different venue and financial scenario. “I still am looking for another home for the Double Door, and there are some very good possibilities,” he said, noting he’s zeroing in on the Logan Square and Avondale neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Mulroney has partnered with Gallery Cabaret, the long-running bar and performance space in Bucktown, helping to revive it after current owner Mike Strandberg briefly closed shop the past two months to re-evaluate operations. There’s a soft opening planned for March 1, with events planned through April. “I'm going to start putting some of my people in there and some bands. I’ve got all of these ideas I want to try out,” said Mulroney, aiming to hold true to Double Door’s original formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The venue was known for its eclectic lineups, and what set it apart was how it treated every band like a headliner on a national tour, Mulroney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“'If the talent loves it, that comes across to the audience. And there's no better feeling in the world than walking in the room with a band that's on stage and realizing that all those people are having as good a time as I was.”&lt;/p&gt;",

A federal prosecution is intimidating. It carries the threat of prison time. Damaging news stories spread online. Freedoms are often restricted, even in minor cases. Lawyers are needed, though federal defenders have saved people from big legal bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 17 cleared defendants spent a combined 150 days in federal custody, records show. That doesn’t include 35 days, and counting, that Juan Espinoza Martinez has been held by immigration authorities &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/01/22/federal-jury-rejects-bovino-murder-plot-after-called-upon-stand-up-overreaching-government\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;since he was acquitted&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly placing a hit on Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official who became the face of the deportation operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s to say nothing of the flesh-and-blood cost borne by Marimar Martinez, the woman &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/03/marimar-martinez-shot-border-patrol-chicago-speaks-out-after-good-pretti-deaths-i-am-their-voice\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;shot five times by a Border Patrol agent&lt;/a&gt; on the Southwest Side in early October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes aren’t so high in every case. Jackie Guataquira, whose four-month old misdemeanor case was recently dropped, said she never spent a night in jail and didn’t have to physically appear in court. But the prosecution kept her from visiting family in Mexico, Guataquira said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It just shows “they want to come for people at every single level,” she told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re really just trying to take people’s lives away, deport them out of this country, or at the … more minor level, paint people who are righteously protesting and standing up to this as ‘terrorists,’” she said. “They’re slapping these people’s photos all over social media for this, just to get people away from being able to protest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘Your life gets turned upside down’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors are expected to bring charges only when they can prove them to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Normally, they boast &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/14/fewer-than-1-of-defendants-in-federal-criminal-cases-were-acquitted-in-2022/#:~:text=This%20analysis%20is%20based%20on,Office%20of%20the%20U.S.%20Courts\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;a conviction rate of around 90%&lt;/a&gt;. But Trump’s Justice Department has suffered a string of high-profile losses tied to its national immigration campaign, including in a recent &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-02-06/federal-public-defenders-winning\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;six-case losing streak&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chicago, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/05/30/andrew-boutros-interim-us-attorney-chicago-judges-role-pam-bondi\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;U.S. Attorney Andrew Boutros’&lt;/a&gt; office is looking at a best-case conviction rate of around 47% in such cases. That’s assuming it secures a conviction against each of the remaining 15 defendants, and no additional charges are brought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boutros said many of the cases were brought as a result of “reactive arrests” in the field. Some of them were better suited for state court, he said. Others were dropped out of concern that jurors would reject charges even when they’re proven, or for mitigating factors like mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our grace should not be confused as a reflection of the strength of any particular case or whether a charge should have been filed,” Boutros said in a statement. “It is a testament to our view that the role of the prosecutor is to seek justice and not just convict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We decide cases based on facts, law, and equities without regard to the attitude of sneering disbelief held by a certain group of critics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-6e0000\" name=\"html-embed-module-6e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-table\" data-src=\"visualisation/27349648\"&gt;&lt;script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/27349648/thumbnail\" width=\"100%\" alt=\"table visualization\" /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney General Pam Bondi &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/03/28/former-prosecutor-andrew-boutros-named-chicagos-interim-u-s-attorney\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;initially appointed Boutros&lt;/a&gt; to his job on a temporary basis in early 2025. Chicago’s U.S. District Court judges then &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2025/07/25/chicagos-federal-judges-choose-andrew-boutros-as-top-prosecutor\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;picked him to serve&lt;/a&gt; on a more permanent basis once Bondi’s appointment expired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said there are “enormous consequences” when someone is charged with a federal crime. That’s true even if the prosecution is abandoned, Levenson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your life gets turned upside down when you’re charged with a federal case,” Levenson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the greater cost, she said, is to “the credibility of the justice system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Charges dropped — but damage is done &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities arrested Collins, 32, and Robledo, 30, on Sept. 27 outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, which became a hub for fierce protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days earlier, a shooter opened fire on an ICE facility&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in Dallas. Emotions ran high. Without naming the couple, Bovino referred to Collins and Robledo online as “two deranged individuals, armed with pistols.” Users on X shared &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/1972684789028171930\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;his social media post&lt;/a&gt; 278 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t find out the hard way,” Bovino wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins and Robledo never faced any charges related to the guns,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;which they were lawfully carrying and never brandished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, a criminal complaint alleged that Robledo ignored commands and pushed back when law enforcement told people to move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once officers began to struggle with Robledo, Collins allegedly yelled at them to get away and charged toward them. The feds said Collins resisted agents — and injured one agent’s thumb. Collins told the Sun-Times he \"did not start\"&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the altercation and \"did not assault anyone.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors later sought to have the couple detained. U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Fuentes ruled that Robledo didn’t qualify&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for detention. Collins did, because of the agent’s injury, and Collins’ attorney insisted on an immediate hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge ordered Collins detained. He questioned Collins’ judgment in bringing a gun to an ICE protest, “particularly given ICE’s recent history of aggressive enforcement tactics while heavily armed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robledo said Collins, who is Black, was seemingly held in jail longer “simply because of the color of his skin.”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Collins said he suspects the judge “subconsciously” assumed “I carried and I was a dangerous individual because of my presentation in court, my looks, and the area that I’m from.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" data-embed&gt;\n                &lt;iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADy5XJc9b-Y?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen title=\"This Chicago couple fought charges brought by the Trump administration — and won\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his written order, Fuentes said the defense request for an immediate hearing left him without a report that might have addressed Collins’ employment and lack of criminal history, as well as his personal background. The decision “was an extremely close call,” the judge wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuentes predicted that a reviewing judge could take advantage of “a more fulsome record.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three days later, U.S. District Judge Sunil Harjani&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;ordered Collins’ release with that additional information in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, on Oct. 8, the feds dropped the charges. A grand jury had refused to indict, in a rare rebuke of federal prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time spent in jail was “nerve-wracking,” Collins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not because I was scared that I was in federal prison,” he explained. “But just the stress of knowing that I can’t take care of my pets, my family. That the justice system does not work even when you haven’t done anything wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robledo has been hesitant to join protests in Broadview ever since. As someone who has been involved in demonstrations since the age of 13, Robledo said that’s “life changing”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;— but insisted it’s not “life ruining.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It makes it harder for you to do anything,” Robledo said of the prosecution. “That’s the point, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I decided a long time ago that that wasn’t going to happen to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuentes has since &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/20/unusual-and-possibly-unprecedented-judge-calls-out-chicago-feds-as-midway-blitz-cases-fall-apart\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;questioned some of the charges&lt;/a&gt; brought amid Operation Midway Blitz, including against Collins and Robledo. He did so in an opinion&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;issued in late November, after a series of cases before him&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge wrote that he’d “obtained sworn confirmation that video backed up”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the feds’ claims against Collins and Robledo. Still, he wrote, “the grand jury refused to find probable cause.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is a sobering event for a magistrate judge,” Fuentes wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: “Any responsible federal prosecutor knows that federal charges, or any actions by the United States attorney directed at the citizenry, must be undertaken with the utmost care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘Levels of repression’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez has become the most prominent of the 17 cleared Midway Blitz defendants in Chicago. She testified recently &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/03/marimar-martinez-goes-to-washington-wants-trump-officials-to-admit-not-a-domestic-terrorist\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;before Democratic members of Congress&lt;/a&gt;.

The feds accused Espinoza Martinez, 37, of offering $10,000 for Bovino’s murder. Espinoza Martinez spent 109 days in jail — far more than any other Midway Blitz defendant who's been cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His prosecution revolved around a Snapchat message he sent to an acquaintance&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;that purportedly offered $2,000 for Bovino’s capture and $10,000 for his head. Espinoza Martinez is a Mexican citizen and father who lived in Chicago for 30 years and has no criminal history, records show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told agents he didn’t mean for anyone to actually carry out the murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury found Espinoza Martinez not guilty on Jan. 22.

But Guataquira, 30, says it shows how people are being targeted by the feds “even at the most ‘minor’ level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 19 weeks, Guataquira faced a misdemeanor charge alleging she’d impeded a federal employee in Broadview. She told the Sun-Times she was accused of knocking a phone out of an agent’s hand Oct. 3, the day Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited the ICE facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors finally dropped the case against Guataquira on Feb. 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guataquira said she was held in custody for about six hours but never overnight. She said she’s since spent her days traveling and never had to attend court in person. She reported to the U.S. Marshals office over the holidays to be processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But authorities took her passport. She said that prevented her from visiting family in Mexico and otherwise crossing the border during her travels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to go to Vancouver Island when we were in Washington,” Guataquira said. “Could not do any of that. So that was, I think, one of the biggest things that bugged me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all amounts to “different levels of repression,” she said, “from the legal end of things to your livelihood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sullied reputations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levenson, the Loyola law professor, is also a former federal prosecutor. She said Trump’s second term brought significant change to the Justice Department, where top officials seem to be “using the power of prosecution for revenge and retribution.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s about chilling demonstrators,\" Levenson said. “It’s about intimidation. It’s about flexing the federal muscle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even a misdemeanor case like Guataquira’s carries a threat of prison time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All you know is that the government’s being extremely aggressive,” Levenson said. “So you think of the worst.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\"  data-align-floatRight&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-0c0000\" name=\"image-0c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c9fc4b3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/396x222+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F45%2Fb8%2F80bd500849ef927ce982f0843fed%2Flevenson-laurie-new-faculty-photo.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/770246d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/396x222+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F45%2Fb8%2F80bd500849ef927ce982f0843fed%2Flevenson-laurie-new-faculty-photo.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3b4f73/2147483647/strip/true/crop/396x222+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F45%2Fb8%2F80bd500849ef927ce982f0843fed%2Flevenson-laurie-new-faculty-photo.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A portrait of Laurie Levenson smiling and wearing a yellow blazer\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3b4f73/2147483647/strip/true/crop/396x222+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F45%2Fb8%2F80bd500849ef927ce982f0843fed%2Flevenson-laurie-new-faculty-photo.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9c6a8c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/396x222+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F45%2Fb8%2F80bd500849ef927ce982f0843fed%2Flevenson-laurie-new-faculty-photo.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f3b4f73/2147483647/strip/true/crop/396x222+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F45%2Fb8%2F80bd500849ef927ce982f0843fed%2Flevenson-laurie-new-faculty-photo.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laurie Levenson, professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loyola Law School&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s limited legal recourse available to people caught up in failed federal prosecutions, she said.

They have a label that is put on them and it’s very hard to get that removed from the public psyche.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levenson said it could “take years to repair any trust in credibility in the Justice Department,” including within the judiciary, following so many failed prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What really troubles me,” Levenson said, “is there is real crime out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But if you’re busy spending your time, money, [and] energy on cases where, ultimately, they will be or should be dropped,” she said, “then you’re not protecting society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/tracker-federal-prosecutions-chicago-status-trumps-immigration-blitz-ice\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Tracking every known federal prosecution in Chicago tied to Trump’s immigration blitz&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/11/20/unusual-and-possibly-unprecedented-judge-calls-out-chicago-feds-as-midway-blitz-cases-fall-apart\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;‘Unusual and possibly unprecedented’: Judge calls out Chicago feds as Midway Blitz cases fall apart&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/03/marimar-martinez-shot-border-patrol-chicago-speaks-out-after-good-pretti-deaths-i-am-their-voice\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Marimar Martinez, shot by Border Patrol in Chicago, speaks out after Good, Pretti deaths: ‘I am their voice’&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Since we're on the south side of that system, it's going to be pulling in warm air northward, so we're kind of benefiting from our placement, but that's still going to drive a cold front through our area.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Weather whiplashes are pretty common this time of year, and that's just what can be taking place with the system,\" Borchardt added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a \"couple of chances for snow\" Saturday near the Wisconsin state line and Sunday night in the south suburbs, though the metro area may not see much snow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It won't be slam dunks for everybody,\" Borchardt said of the snow probabilities. &lt;/p&gt;",

It’s been there since he stepped on the court as a freshman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He can’t get sped up,” Jaxson’s dad Brian Davis said. “He plays at his own pace. That’s his superpower that most people don’t have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis has a rare comfort level on the court for a 17-year-old, and it didn’t happen by chance. He spent thousands of hours of his childhood at Joy of the Game in Deerfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Davis worked as president of the large basketball facility and as a coach for the Rising Stars club team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no doubt that was very important,” Brian Davis said. “I was working there all the time, mornings to evenings. My wife went back to work and Jaxson lived at Joy of the Game, basically. He was at all my practices, watching the dream team with Jabari Parker and Tommy Hamilton.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family photos from Davis’s childhood show how basketball has always dominated his life. There’s a picture of Davis being held as a baby by Kobe Bryant. Derrick Rose and Jaxson when he was a toddler. A very young Jaxson with Jimmy Butler.

Three years old and throwing it up at a 10-foot rim. It just played a huge part in developing my skill set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I remember waking up early on Saturday and Sundays to watch the older guys play. Joy of the Game was a big spot where NBA guys would come in and work out. Seeing those people taught me a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis led Warren to the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2025/03/15/warren-benet-ihsa-state-championship\"   &gt;state championship game&lt;/a&gt; last year as a sophomore. His confidence, composure and basketball IQ elevated his above-average team into a state title contender the past two seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew when he was young that he had a chance to play after high school,” Brian Davis said. “He always played up multiple levels, and his IQ was off the charts. He saw things before other players did. That will always be there. But there are things he needs to get better at as far as shooting, taking contact and getting stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis made headlines with his &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2025/12/30/jaxson-davis-warren-basketball-big-dipper\"   &gt;51-point performance&lt;/a&gt; in the Big Dipper Holiday Tournament championship game in December and is on pace to become the all-time leading scorer in Lake County history and one of the top scorers in state history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That stuff is cool, but I really just want to win the state championship,” Davis said. “That’s my main goal overall.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis has nearly 20 college scholarship offers, including most of the Big Ten. He’s widely considered a top 40 player in the national Class of 2027 and next year he will be the state’s best hope for a McDonald’s All-American in several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has always been a dream of mine to get an offer from a blue blood school,” Davis said. “I still have a lot of time left and they don’t usually get involved until around this spring. I think they will be sniffing around soon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-bf0000\" name=\"image-bf0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bbc6fa9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F5c%2Fb36fe7ab41478328571adec9daa2%2Fob-cst-022026-7057-crp.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a9f8863/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F5c%2Fb36fe7ab41478328571adec9daa2%2Fob-cst-022026-7057-crp.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ce7014/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F5c%2Fb36fe7ab41478328571adec9daa2%2Fob-cst-022026-7057-crp.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Jaxson Davis handles the ball against DePaul Prep.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ce7014/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F5c%2Fb36fe7ab41478328571adec9daa2%2Fob-cst-022026-7057-crp.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f2830ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F5c%2Fb36fe7ab41478328571adec9daa2%2Fob-cst-022026-7057-crp.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ce7014/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F5c%2Fb36fe7ab41478328571adec9daa2%2Fob-cst-022026-7057-crp.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaxson Davis handles the ball against DePaul Prep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike many of the area’s high-profile basketball and football stars, Davis has not signed with an agent or focused on NIL yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That will all come,” Brian Davis said. “We have gotten plenty of phone calls from top agencies. We are just letting him play basketball and be a kid for now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Davis is a varsity assistant coach and the sophomore coach at Warren. Jaxson’s brother plays on the sophomore team, and there are usually 12 to 15 family members at Warren basketball games. The family is supremely focused on winning the state championship that the Blue Devils came so close to last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last year the title game against Benet was a roller coaster,” Davis said. “But we learned a lot. It is a huge challenge. Private schools are able to recruit. But we are right there. [This season] &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2026/01/24/benet-basketball-warren-when-sides-collide\"   &gt;we lost to Benet&lt;/a&gt; by seven and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/2026/02/19/depaul-prep-basketball-warren\"   &gt;DePaul Prep&lt;/a&gt; by four and we shot the ball terrible from three in that game. We aren’t that far from where we need to be to win a state championship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of Davis’s best friends and the other best local players in the class of 2027, Davion Thompson and Devin Cleveland, left the state for prep schools last year. As of now, Davis plans to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t have any reason to leave,” Davis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CHICAGO SUN-TIMES PLAYERS OF THE
