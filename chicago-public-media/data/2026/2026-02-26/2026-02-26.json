Gilbert Villegas (36th) and Ruth Cruz (30th). They cited a host of concerns raised by animal care advocates and current and former volunteers at the city-run shelter at 2741 S. Western.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They ranged from high euthanasia rates and poor living conditions to three years of “steadily increased” dogs bites that have jeopardized public safety. The letter also claimed that Chicago police officers are frequently asked to cover animal care and control duties that are best handled by trained employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those concerns, Johnson’s stood  firmly behind Capello, and blamed the challenges she faces on the affordability crisis in Chicago and around the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Between 2023 and 2025, intake increased by nearly 5,000 additional cats and dogs. Higher food and veterinarian costs have led more Chicagoans to make the tragic decision to relinquish their animals, contributing to this intake growth,” the mayor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With intake rising,   transfers to the city’s rescue partners have surged to their highest levels in a decade. Euthanasia rates remained flat from 2024 to 2025, when adoption rates rose to their highest rate in department history, the mayor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/07/25/pet-owner-surrender-dogs-cats-overwhelming-shelters-rescues\"   &gt;Pet owner surrender rates are up, overwhelming Chicago shelters&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cappello described said the pressure the high-volume municipal shelter is under as “real and constant.” Dogs and cats arrive every day, “often in crisis.” No animal gets turned away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our doors are open to everything that comes in. We do take sick animals on a regular basis. Sometimes, sick animals stay here too long and can get sick. We don’t have the option of closing our door and saying, `We’re not going to take those today,’“ Cappello said. “We do our best… But with that sheer number of animals, you’re going to have illness. It’s going to happen. Our medical staff is on top of that. They look at it as much as they can. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-be0000\" name=\"image-be0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c5491c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F12%2F5591dc854c668cf116e296da074c%2Fmayorpets-260226-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9d518ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F12%2F5591dc854c668cf116e296da074c%2Fmayorpets-260226-08.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5f7307f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F12%2F5591dc854c668cf116e296da074c%2Fmayorpets-260226-08.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Executive Director of Chicago Animal Care and Control Susan Cappello speaks at a press conference at Chicago Animal Care &amp;amp; Control on Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2026. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5f7307f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F12%2F5591dc854c668cf116e296da074c%2Fmayorpets-260226-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8d3f9a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F12%2F5591dc854c668cf116e296da074c%2Fmayorpets-260226-08.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5f7307f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F12%2F5591dc854c668cf116e296da074c%2Fmayorpets-260226-08.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive Director of Chicago Animal Care and Control Susan Cappello speaks at a press conference at Chicago Animal Care &amp;amp; Control on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giacomo Cain/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cappello acknowledged that many of the 240 dogs at the city-run shelter are only being walked once a week. They spend most of their time cooped up in cages. Her goal, she said, is to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every dog gets a walk every day. That can only help. The fresh air. The outside. The interaction with people. Make them more adoptable. Make them more visible. That’s our goal for this year — and it’s a big one,” Cappello said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruz  said Capello was warned about the lack of exercise and dog-walking at a City Council hearing on shelter conditions last year, and waited until now to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t understand waiting three years for the mayor to appoint someone that he describes as a remarkable,” Cruz told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruz said she’s been bombarded with complaints from animal rights advocates and volunteers, who have described “unsafe and unsanitary conditions for the animals” and a “toxic” environment for volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At any point, if volunteers disagree or bring new ideas and the leadership doesn’t agree with them, then they’re asked not to come back again,” Cruz said. “There’s a toxic culture... and fear of retaliation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villegas acknowledged that there have been chronic complaints about conditions at the city's animal shelter for decades under a host of different leaders, as well as complaints about funding for the facility. But he said when volunteers demand a nationwide search, the city owes it to those animal advocates to conduct one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-eb0000\" name=\"image-eb0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/142c04c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fff%2Fc0ff32444b47b2ffe3d5ec7cd041%2Fmayorpets-260226-19.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/88bf9d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fff%2Fc0ff32444b47b2ffe3d5ec7cd041%2Fmayorpets-260226-19.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c44199/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fff%2Fc0ff32444b47b2ffe3d5ec7cd041%2Fmayorpets-260226-19.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A worker changes paperwork on a dog cage at Chicago Animal Care &amp;amp; Control on Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2026. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c44199/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fff%2Fc0ff32444b47b2ffe3d5ec7cd041%2Fmayorpets-260226-19.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eaa4df6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fff%2Fc0ff32444b47b2ffe3d5ec7cd041%2Fmayorpets-260226-19.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c44199/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fff%2Fc0ff32444b47b2ffe3d5ec7cd041%2Fmayorpets-260226-19.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A worker changes paperwork on a dog cage at Chicago Animal Care &amp;amp; Control on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giacomo Cain/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We're talking about volunteers who have been fired by Animal Care and Control.

Biss said the status quo structure that put America into the place it is must be “fully analyzed.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abughazaleh called on Democrats to start using their resources for constituents, pointing to her office’s doubling up as an aid distribution center which has been offering donated toiletries and clothes, among other items, for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Democratic party could be doing this at large,” Abughazaleh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-400000\" name=\"image-400000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9633d02/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5747x3225+0+303/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F34%2Ff9b8a766447eb8e70fd6d26de28e%2F9th-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/10ccb33/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5747x3225+0+303/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F34%2Ff9b8a766447eb8e70fd6d26de28e%2F9th-2.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abd5951/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5747x3225+0+303/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F34%2Ff9b8a766447eb8e70fd6d26de28e%2F9th-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"BUSHRA-092525_16.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abd5951/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5747x3225+0+303/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F34%2Ff9b8a766447eb8e70fd6d26de28e%2F9th-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b04a420/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5747x3225+0+303/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F34%2Ff9b8a766447eb8e70fd6d26de28e%2F9th-2.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abd5951/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5747x3225+0+303/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F34%2Ff9b8a766447eb8e70fd6d26de28e%2F9th-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois Congressional District 9 candidates: Bushra Amiwala (from left), state Sen.

Simmons detailed the process of returning cars to constituents after their loved ones were taken by federal agents. Andrew, a former federal agent, was softer than other candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have politicized this system,” Andrew said, noting he previously worked with (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) in the FBI. “ICE, as it exists right now, is dangerous. Our court system is the right place for this accountability. … I don't encourage people to engage on the street.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amiwala and Simmons both called for the agency to be abolished. Simmons said private prisons should be outlawed as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ICE as an institution cannot be trusted,” Amiwala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine took similar hits from Biss and Abughazaleh over her lack of action on the streets after she said her legislative work was “more important” than protesting at Broadview or being out with rapid response groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was one of many points in which the temperature rose at the table, including after Biss pressed when moderator Paris Schutz questioned Fine about an AIPAC-affiliated super PAC running ads to support her bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't know if you believe the words coming out of your own mouth,” Fine fired at Biss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Who will you be representing if you get elected?” Biss shot back later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the exact hypocrisy people are sick of in politics,\" Abughazaleh said.&lt;/p&gt;",

Delia Ramirez met face to face with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Wednesday in a combative closed-door meeting in Washington and told her in no uncertain terms — twice — that she'll work to impeach her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, spent about 35 minutes with Noem, who also brought her son to the meeting and was seated behind the secretary. Noem in December told Ramirez at a committee hearing that she would meet with her after repeated requests — despite the Ramirez accusing the agency head of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/12/11/kristi-noem-testimony-congress-delia-ramirez-tammy-duckworth-trump-troop-deployments\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;violating court orders and lying to the public.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It began and ended with the Illinois Democrat warning Noem that her days in the administration could be numbered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I said to her, ‘I want to be pretty clear with you as we get started. I'm going to tell you everything I have said to you on record, and it's important for you to hear this directly from me. One, I continue to call for your removal,’’ Ramirez told the Sun-Times. “‘I expect that you resign. That if you don't resign or get impeached, I also recognize that your days may be numbered,’ which I believe they are. However, she is still the secretary. She clearly holds that position, and as such that I expected her to execute her oath of office and abide by the law of the United States of America.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the meeting, DHS said in a statement that Noem regularly meets with members of Congress, regardless of their party. But a spokesperson also placed blame on Democrats for the latest shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope that the Congresswoman puts the same amount of energy into funding DHS so we can do our work to protect Americans from threats from terrorists, criminals and public safety threats as she has writing letters to the Secretary to resign,” a spokesperson said. “Every day this shutdown continues, Democrat members continue to get paid while they put our national security second to politics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez came equipped with what she called \"bare minimum actions.\" They included asking Noem to re-establish  protected areas, including churches, schools and hospitals — in accordance with  a 2021 memorandum by former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. She also asked Noem to establish and codify use of force standards, arguing the department has been empowered through a lack of oversight and too much latitude to violate rights under the pretense of security. Ramirez is leading an effort to statutorily mandate DHS’ use of force policy. According to Ramirez, Noem told her that the department has a use of force report procedure and said it is covered in training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another request was for Noem to revoke a warrantless home entry memo, a controversial policy that has allowed ICE agents to enter homes without a judicial warrant — and asked that DHS respect laws and regulations, including vehicle registration laws that prevent swapping or changing license plates. In the wake of reports of federal immigration officers driving cars without proper license plates or modified plates, Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias in October created a tipline to collect and investigate license plate violations. The announcement came two weeks after the Sun-Times sent him proof of DHS officers driving on public streets &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/10/09/federal-immigration-officers-ice-dhs-license-plates-immigration\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;without one or both Illinois license plates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez also told Noem federal agents must abide by court orders, but Ramirez said Noem asserted that agents are indeed following court orders. When Ramirez pushed back, Noem asked for more details on specific court orders they’re violating. Ramirez referenced DHS agents using chemical weapons at least four times, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/16/judge-hauling-ice-official-into-court-as-aggressive-tactics-continue-despite-her-order-im-not-blind\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;despite court orders from U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a discussion about detention centers, Ramirez mentioned reports across the country of people who did not receive timely medical care while detained, and of some of her constituents who detailed food shortages at facilities. Noem denied to Ramirez that people are not receiving medical care, and she asked for a specific list of people who have complained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noem also told Ramirez that there are plans to “consolidate” some of the country’s 225 detention centers. She did not specifically reference Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez detailed incidents in Chicago in which people were tear-gassed going into a grocery store just one block from a school, children being rushed out of school playgrounds and chemical agents being sprayed near children. She also talked about drop-in visits by federal immigration agents at area hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I said to her, ‘You continue to deny what your agents are doing on the ground, but I'm going to tell you what I have seen with my own eyes that your agents have done,’” Ramirez said. “She acted like she had no idea what I was talking about, as if she did not know that she had agents in the hospital for days as they were waiting for one of my constituents, who had been harmed as they were attempting to detain him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez also told Noem about &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=jessie+fuentes+arrest+sun-times&amp;amp;oq=jessie+fuentes+&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCAgAEEUYJxg7MggIABBFGCcYOzIGCAEQRRg5MhAIAhAuGK8BGMcBGIAEGI4FMgcIAxAAGIAEMgcIBBAAGIAEMgcIBRAAGIAEMgcIBhAAGIAEMgYIBxBFGDzSAQgzODgzajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Ald. Jessie Fuentes’ being handcuffed by agents at a Humboldt Park hospital&lt;/a&gt; as she came to check on that constituent in October. Fuentes asked agents if they had signed a judicial warrant and then was shoved by one agent, who was fully masked and not wearing any identification, according to a video posted to social media. After her third question about a judicial warrant, the alderperson was handcuffed. Fuentes was ultimately released — but has since filed a federal tort claim seeking $100,000 in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez said Noem repeatedly told her to let her know \"when these things are happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You and I both know she knows what is happening, and she has chosen to ignore them,\" Ramirez said. \"So she's accountable.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

We are used to playing in games like this, so it didn’t affect us as much as Notre Dame.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-cd0000\" name=\"image-cd0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9711490/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2F93%2Feb08bf3c414d8a8e611178cbc096%2Fob-cst-022626-7007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fb04506/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2F93%2Feb08bf3c414d8a8e611178cbc096%2Fob-cst-022626-7007.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aaa9057/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2F93%2Feb08bf3c414d8a8e611178cbc096%2Fob-cst-022626-7007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"St. Patrick&amp;#x27;s Omar Ajanovic, left, drives toward the basket during the Shamrocks victory over Notre Dame.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aaa9057/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2F93%2Feb08bf3c414d8a8e611178cbc096%2Fob-cst-022626-7007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/657df94/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2F93%2Feb08bf3c414d8a8e611178cbc096%2Fob-cst-022626-7007.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aaa9057/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2F93%2Feb08bf3c414d8a8e611178cbc096%2Fob-cst-022626-7007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Patrick’s Omar Ajanovic, left, drives toward the basket during the Shamrocks victory over Notre Dame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Patrick (26-4) held the Dons (14-17) without a field goal for the first 11:30 of the game and led 32-7 at halftime and 42-9 midway through the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Notre Dame] just had trouble with the pressure of it all,” McPartlin said. “We did a good job staying on the ball no matter where it went.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McPartlin led the Shamrocks with 14 points and six rebounds. Neely added 13 points and four rebounds and senior Joseph Costanzo scored 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is the last ride for the three of us and we made sure to keep the underclassmen focused,” Costanzo said. “This was a big game, and we struggled against Notre Dame at home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costanzo was injured playing football in his junior year and didn’t have a large role in the run to Champaign last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I missed a lot last year, and I put a lot of hard work in to come back from that injury, and it all paid off,” Costanzo said. “I’ve had so much fun this season playing with these guys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emran Alispahic, a 6-3 freshman, led Notre Dame with 14 and senior Carmen Meccia added six points and five rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Patrick has an extremely difficult playoff path and will face No. 12 New Trier in the regional final on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is going to be a rough game here at their place,” McPartlin said. “But we are experienced with the pressure and now we have a feel for the court. Hopefully we can come out on top.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey, who picked up his 700th win this season, has been St. Patrick’s coach since 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t remember a game against Notre Dame this lopsided in a while,” Bailey said. “I’m sure somewhere along the line there was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But this team has done this all year. They’ve been the same team for every game. There are no highs or lows. We don’t play any differently whether it is Notre Dame or Curie. We play our style of ball. That is a credit to our guys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Notre Dame and St. Patrick ready to go.

Cactus League game outcomes in February are no measure of how teams will be equipped to win in April, not when front-line players are playing every other day and for half a game. Not when minor-league campers are slapping hands in victorious handshake lines while top-salaried players are grilling steaks or playing golf, oblivious to the game’s outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you’re the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox\"   &gt;White Sox&lt;/a&gt;, the triple-digit losers of 2023, ‘24 and ‘25, there’s no harm in being attached to a kinda-cute 4-2 record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on the process and the things we’re doing before that result,” manager Will Venable said after the Sox opened spring training with three straight wins. “Winning isn’t something that you just flip a switch, you know? It is important that we finish these games and do the things up to the end of these games that lead to winning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’d be hard-pressed to remember the Sox’ record last spring (11-19). All associated with the team are trying to forget the 60-102 mark during the regular season. For what it’s worth, that 3-0 start this spring was the first one since 2004, a year before the Sox won the World Series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, 4-2 in spring training beats 0-6, especially for a team stained by defeat but believing it’s ready to take the initial baby steps toward becoming a contender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s always great to get the result, and we want to win every one of these games,” Venable said. “We’re competitive and we know that wins matter. Create habits that lead to good results. It’s nice having those upfront here, and we want to continue getting as many as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything to change the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is probably the most exciting it’s been since I’ve been here, as far as what we can do this year,” said outfielder Andrew Benintendi, entering the fourth year of his five-year contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A culture and routine of losing is the last thing anyone wants to become accustomed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No, hell no,” Benintendi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Special guest&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;White Sox 2005 World Series second baseman Tadahito Iguchi was at camp, having a particular interest in Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am very happy that he picked the White Sox,” Iguchi said. “We’re looking forward to the Japanese fans getting to know the White Sox better. They are going to pay attention to Murakami.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Japanese-born position player to win the World Series, Iguchi managed the Chiba Lotte Marines for five seasons and now works for Japanese media (NHK Japan) as a studio analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Murakami was already a big star,” Iguchi said. “He already has successful records in Japan, so he doesn’t have to change anything. Just be yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Acuna leaves with cut&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Center fielder Luisangel Acuna needed four stitches for a cut above his left eyebrow suffered while sliding head first into second base on a successful steal against the Reds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquired from the Mets in the Luis Robert trade, Acuna (3-for-7 this spring) had two singles before exiting. Before the game, Venable said Acuna “looks really good” in center field, where he has appeared in only two games in the majors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first step-stuff, pre-pitch stuff we’ve been working on,” Venable said, “He’s been out there this winter. It’s been kind of fine-tuning things for him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primarily an infielder with the Mets, Acuna is also working on throwing from different arm slots from the outfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reds 3, Sox 2&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortstop Colson Montgomery, back after missing two days with an illness, looked healthy homering against non-roster invitee Lyon Richardson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• In his second to last tuneup before leaving for the World Baseball Classic,  first baseman Murakami went 1-for-3 with a strikeout. Murakami (.385) is 4-for-13 with no homers and five strikeouts going into Thursday's game against the Dodgers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Pitching in his first game, right-hander Davis Martin said he felt in sync for the first time this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It felt like it was a best version of myself so far in camp, so it's exciting and something to build off of going forward,” Martin said after allowing a run (Sal Stewart homer) in two innings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better was righty Jonathan Cannon, pitching three perfect innings with one strikeout as he vies for a rotation spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• On deck: Sox at Dodgers, 2:05 p.m., Thursday, Glendale, Sean Newcombe vs. Tyler Glasnow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListL\" data-module

Excited observers on social media noted them, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox\"   &gt;White Sox’&lt;/a&gt; big right-hander, pitching in relief for the first time in five years, unleashed five pitches at 100 mph in his Cactus League debut against the Brewers on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s great, but they don’t mean everything,” McDougal said. “You want to put the best out there that you can and the numbers are great but the results are better. It’s great I can do this or do that but am I getting outs? That’s your job as a pitcher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDougal pitched two scoreless innings with two strikeouts and earned a save, so all was well. The White Sox are projecting the 2021 fifth-round pick to land a spot in a near-future starting rotation, which wasn’t the case after he went 0-11 with a 6.04 ERA between two levels of Class A in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A punch in the mouth” and a wakeup call, McDougal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He would bounce back with a strong season at High-A Winston-Salem and Double-A Birmingham in 2025, boosting his ranking among Sox prospects to No. 7, according to MLB Pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the 2026 rotation is anything but set or close to formidable as of now, a stable of young arms, including first-round left-handers Noah Schultz and Hagen Smith, right-hander Grant Taylor and McDougal provides hope. All are in the ears-open learning phase of their promising careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying to be a sponge, trying to learn as much as I can from these guys who’ve done it,” said McDougal, in his first big-league camp after getting added to the Sox 40-man roster in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He earned that after posting a 3.26 ERA over 28 starts evenly divided between Winston-Salem and Birmingham last season, with 136 strikeouts and 49 walks in 113 1/3 innings last season. “Guys who maybe broke a camp or got called up in the middle of the year, listening to them and trying to get my bearings for how to go about things because you need to be prepared for that big jump from the minor leagues to the big leagues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it happens is to be determined for McDougal, who also features a curveball, slider and changeup. The slider is a pitch to land for a strike and the curve, he said, is a bigger breaking pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fastball, though, is what caused the commotion Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People talk about it, for sure but it’s not something we’re super homed in on,” McDougal said of the triple-digit achievements. “It’s great, it’s awesome, but it’s also February, you know what I mean? We have to sustain that for two weeks, for eight months. It’s not a goal. The goal is to get outs, roll the batting order over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitching out of the pen “was kind of wild, it was a rush and it’s like you have the freedom to go out there and let it eat,” McDougal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s believed to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone is different,” McDougal said. “Some people can do that, others it takes time to get into their velo ranges. But the biggest thing is never to baby it, try to be someone you’re not. And allow your body to do what it wants to do, that is probably the healthiest thing you can do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manager Will Venable has seen numerous pitchers airing it out already, including Grant Taylor who touched 100 multiple times his first time out. Jordan Hicks hit 100 three times against the Reds on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s fine by Venable, who expects to see pitchers in competition-for-jobs mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not sure anything I can say can help regulate that,” Venable said. “You get out there between the lines and these guys are going to do what they do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Envisioning the 6-5 McDougal doing what he does as a starter “is really attractive,” Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Great stuff. Very competitive and a lot of energy and competitive spirit on the field, which is great to see. With him, it’s about throwing strikes. When he’s in the zone, what that looks like, want to encourage him to stay in the zone because he has great stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

A timeline for the test wasn’t provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to begin laying the early groundwork for our ride-hailing operations in Chicago, and look forward to serving the city in the future,” the company wrote on its blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayor Brandon Johnson’s office says the city was given a heads up. The Chicago test comes a day after the company announced it was dispatching its robotaxis in four more cities in Texas and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As of now, autonomous vehicles have not been authorized within the City of Chicago or the State of Illinois,” Johnson’s office said in a statement. “The City looks forward to engaging with commuters, workers, transit advocates and industry leaders as we pursue constructive dialogue with our partners in Springfield and an equitable path forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Rep. Kam Buckner, D-Chicago, has filed a bill in Springfield to allow autonomous vehicles to be tested in Cook County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This progress is a vital step toward safer streets and more accessible transportation for all our neighborhoods,\" Buckner was quoted as saying in a statement from Waymo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has touted the service as a way to combat drunk driving and give autonomy to epileptic residents who can’t drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckner didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waymo’s robotaxis have experienced problems that have triggered community backlashes and regulatory inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year in San Francisco, a Waymo robotaxi ran over and killed a 9-year-old cat beloved around its neighborhood. Many of the self-driving vehicles later contributed to traffic jams during an extended power outage when they stalled at intersections with darkened traffic signals. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating complaints in Austin, Texas, about Waymo robotaxis operating unsafely around school buses carrying children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Waymo was first granted California permits in 2018, the West coast state rewrote some of its laws earlier this year after police in San Bruno, south of San Francisco, tried to ticket a self-driving vehicle for an illegal U-turn earlier this year. The police department said in a social media post that officers stopped the vehicle, but did not write a ticket as their “citation books don’t have a box for ‘robot,’” opting instead to contact Waymo about the “glitch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christina Whitehouse, founder of the cyclist advocacy group Bike Lane Uprising, said the company started off on the wrong foot by unloading its initial fleet in a bike lane, per videos posted to social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It shows they didn't put any effort into how they're going to be running this, and they'll do whatever they want while they're here,” Whitehouse said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a list of concerns, namely “opaque” operations and reporting, worrying that more cyclists could be hit with less accountability. A California cyclist is &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://bayareabicyclelaw.com/bay-area-bicycle-law-files-lawsuit-against-waymo-and-alphabet-after-san-francisco-bike-lane-collision/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;currently suing the company&lt;/a&gt; after a passenger opened the door after the vehicle parked in a bike lane, hitting the cyclist and throwing her off her bike, only to be hit by another Waymo vehicle that was pulling over to drop off a passenger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California’s DMVs have been regulating the company’s vehicles for eight years. But the state's regulations for robotaxi companies say they only have to report crashes during testing, which must be reported within 10 days, and an annual report on “disengagements,” or when a human driver manually takes over the car. Revisions to the rules are expected later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost is another question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from Obi, a rideshare price comparison company, found that Waymo rides were an average of 12.7% &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://rideobi.com/tesla/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;more expensive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than an Uber and 27.3% more expensive than a Lyft. However, the price gap is smaller for shorter rides — all of which are more expensive than the city’s transit system, which Whitehouse worried would lose legislative attention or resources to a “new and shiny distraction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be great if we could put this energy into the public transportation system,” Whitehouse said. “It has been put on the backburner for so many years, and (public transportation) has the opportunity to be great, accessible and affordable for people. … It would be great if we had working elevators at our CTA stations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contributing: Associated Press&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

They also take five hours of academic classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But under the potential new structure, there would be 30 minutes less of conservatory instruction and those lessons would be embedded throughout the day. Chicago Public Schools officials say they have to shorten the school’s day to comply with union agreements, but students will have the opportunity to participate in up to 100 minutes of additional arts instruction after school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In order to make it sustainable and to have the program be part of the CPS family of fine and performing arts schools, there are certain guardrails and things that need to be changed,” Conrad Timbers-Ausar, CPS’ acting chief portfolio officer, said during a virtual community meeting about the transition Wednesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS did not permit reporters for the Sun-Times and WBEZ to attend the meeting, but we obtained an audio recording of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents and teachers expressed frustration at that explanation, saying the district hadn’t been creative enough in looking for ways to maintain the current conservatory model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Making it an after-school program does not keep it ChiArts,” one parent said during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/11/03/chicago-school-board-chiarts-epic-budgets\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;The school board voted to absorb ChiArts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in November after the private manager of the contract school, which is similar to a charter school, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2025/10/03/chiarts-board-not-renewing-contract-with-cps-citing-unsustainable-deficit-sparking-questions-about-future\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;decided it could no longer run it, citing financial deficits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. More than 530 students attend the school from across the city. Students audition to get in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the Sun-Times, Timbers-Ausar said the presentation wasn't a firm plan but rather an outline for how to maintain the instructional time afforded by the conservatory model while abiding by state law, district policies and other limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also takes into account the district's own financial troubles as it faces a deficit of more than $500 million headed into next school year, he said. The district plans to seek more feedback before coming up with a concrete plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How students are taught through the conservatory is also likely to shift. The school hires professional artists to instruct students in their disciplines. But when CPS runs the school, a state-certified teacher needs to oversee the classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district is recommending that licensed teachers pair up with teaching artists to satisfy graduation requirements. Timbers-Ausar said the district is working to help teaching artists stay on at the new school. As the new school begins to hire staff, current teachers and teaching artists will be first in line for interviews, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Casey Fuess was introduced as the school’s incoming principal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuess is a former choir director at Lindblom Math &amp;amp; Science Academy who spent the last five years as an assistant principal at CPS’ virtual academy, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyfuess/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;according to his LinkedIn profile. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When CPS runs the school, it will be funded like the district’s other 72 fine and performing arts schools. Currently, CPS pays for the academic portion of a student's day, while the money for ChiArts’ conservatory program comes from private donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of the school will likely have to change due to trademark issues, Timbers-Ausar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parent Isabela Cabrera said in an interview that the conservatory model has provided emotional stability for her daughter, who is a freshman at ChiArts. She travels to the school in Humboldt Park from the South Shore neighborhood, but said the program makes the long commute worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You see the kids coming out of school very happy, enjoying life,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cabrera and other parents said they will continue to advocate to keep the conservatory program unchanged by organizing protests and pushing state legislators to allow the school to have longer hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of parents, students and staff plans to demonstrate outside the school on March 3 to call on the district to work with the school community to preserve the current conservatory model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have to keep fighting for this,” Cabrera said.&lt;/p&gt;",
