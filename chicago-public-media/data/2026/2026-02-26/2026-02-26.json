Gilbert Villegas (36th) and Ruth Cruz (30th). They cited a host of concerns raised by animal care advocates and current and former volunteers at the city-run shelter at 2741 S. Western.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They ranged from high euthanasia rates and poor living conditions to three years of “steadily increased” dogs bites that have jeopardized public safety. The letter also claimed that Chicago police officers are frequently asked to cover animal care and control duties that are best handled by trained employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite those concerns, Johnson’s stood  firmly behind Capello, and blamed the challenges she faces on the affordability crisis in Chicago and around the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Between 2023 and 2025, intake increased by nearly 5,000 additional cats and dogs. Higher food and veterinarian costs have led more Chicagoans to make the tragic decision to relinquish their animals, contributing to this intake growth,” the mayor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With intake rising,   transfers to the city’s rescue partners have surged to their highest levels in a decade. Euthanasia rates remained flat from 2024 to 2025, when adoption rates rose to their highest rate in department history, the mayor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/money/2025/07/25/pet-owner-surrender-dogs-cats-overwhelming-shelters-rescues\"   &gt;Pet owner surrender rates are up, overwhelming Chicago shelters&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cappello described said the pressure the high-volume municipal shelter is under as “real and constant.” Dogs and cats arrive every day, “often in crisis.” No animal gets turned away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our doors are open to everything that comes in. We do take sick animals on a regular basis. Sometimes, sick animals stay here too long and can get sick. We don’t have the option of closing our door and saying, `We’re not going to take those today,’“ Cappello said. “We do our best… But with that sheer number of animals, you’re going to have illness. It’s going to happen. Our medical staff is on top of that. They look at it as much as they can. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-be0000\" name=\"image-be0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c5491c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F12%2F5591dc854c668cf116e296da074c%2Fmayorpets-260226-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9d518ae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F12%2F5591dc854c668cf116e296da074c%2Fmayorpets-260226-08.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5f7307f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F12%2F5591dc854c668cf116e296da074c%2Fmayorpets-260226-08.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Executive Director of Chicago Animal Care and Control Susan Cappello speaks at a press conference at Chicago Animal Care &amp;amp; Control on Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2026. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5f7307f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F12%2F5591dc854c668cf116e296da074c%2Fmayorpets-260226-08.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8d3f9a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F12%2F5591dc854c668cf116e296da074c%2Fmayorpets-260226-08.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5f7307f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F12%2F5591dc854c668cf116e296da074c%2Fmayorpets-260226-08.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive Director of Chicago Animal Care and Control Susan Cappello speaks at a press conference at Chicago Animal Care &amp;amp; Control on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giacomo Cain/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cappello acknowledged that many of the 240 dogs at the city-run shelter are only being walked once a week. They spend most of their time cooped up in cages. Her goal, she said, is to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every dog gets a walk every day. That can only help. The fresh air. The outside. The interaction with people. Make them more adoptable. Make them more visible. That’s our goal for this year — and it’s a big one,” Cappello said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruz  said Capello was warned about the lack of exercise and dog-walking at a City Council hearing on shelter conditions last year, and waited until now to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t understand waiting three years for the mayor to appoint someone that he describes as a remarkable,” Cruz told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruz said she’s been bombarded with complaints from animal rights advocates and volunteers, who have described “unsafe and unsanitary conditions for the animals” and a “toxic” environment for volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At any point, if volunteers disagree or bring new ideas and the leadership doesn’t agree with them, then they’re asked not to come back again,” Cruz said. “There’s a toxic culture... and fear of retaliation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Villegas acknowledged that there have been chronic complaints about conditions at the city's animal shelter for decades under a host of different leaders, as well as complaints about funding for the facility. But he said when volunteers demand a nationwide search, the city owes it to those animal advocates to conduct one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-eb0000\" name=\"image-eb0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/142c04c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fff%2Fc0ff32444b47b2ffe3d5ec7cd041%2Fmayorpets-260226-19.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/88bf9d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fff%2Fc0ff32444b47b2ffe3d5ec7cd041%2Fmayorpets-260226-19.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c44199/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fff%2Fc0ff32444b47b2ffe3d5ec7cd041%2Fmayorpets-260226-19.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A worker changes paperwork on a dog cage at Chicago Animal Care &amp;amp; Control on Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2026. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c44199/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fff%2Fc0ff32444b47b2ffe3d5ec7cd041%2Fmayorpets-260226-19.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eaa4df6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fff%2Fc0ff32444b47b2ffe3d5ec7cd041%2Fmayorpets-260226-19.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c44199/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff1%2Fff%2Fc0ff32444b47b2ffe3d5ec7cd041%2Fmayorpets-260226-19.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A worker changes paperwork on a dog cage at Chicago Animal Care &amp;amp; Control on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giacomo Cain/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We're talking about volunteers who have been fired by Animal Care and Control.

Biss said the status quo structure that put America into the place it is must be “fully analyzed.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abughazaleh called on Democrats to start using their resources for constituents, pointing to her office’s doubling up as an aid distribution center which has been offering donated toiletries and clothes, among other items, for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Democratic party could be doing this at large,” Abughazaleh said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-400000\" name=\"image-400000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9633d02/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5747x3225+0+303/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F34%2Ff9b8a766447eb8e70fd6d26de28e%2F9th-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/10ccb33/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5747x3225+0+303/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F34%2Ff9b8a766447eb8e70fd6d26de28e%2F9th-2.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abd5951/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5747x3225+0+303/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F34%2Ff9b8a766447eb8e70fd6d26de28e%2F9th-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"BUSHRA-092525_16.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abd5951/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5747x3225+0+303/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F34%2Ff9b8a766447eb8e70fd6d26de28e%2F9th-2.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b04a420/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5747x3225+0+303/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F34%2Ff9b8a766447eb8e70fd6d26de28e%2F9th-2.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/abd5951/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5747x3225+0+303/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd7%2F34%2Ff9b8a766447eb8e70fd6d26de28e%2F9th-2.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illinois Congressional District 9 candidates: Bushra Amiwala (from left), state Sen.

Simmons detailed the process of returning cars to constituents after their loved ones were taken by federal agents. Andrew, a former federal agent, was softer than other candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have politicized this system,” Andrew said, noting he previously worked with (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) in the FBI. “ICE, as it exists right now, is dangerous. Our court system is the right place for this accountability. … I don't encourage people to engage on the street.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amiwala and Simmons both called for the agency to be abolished. Simmons said private prisons should be outlawed as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ICE as an institution cannot be trusted,” Amiwala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine took similar hits from Biss and Abughazaleh over her lack of action on the streets after she said her legislative work was “more important” than protesting at Broadview or being out with rapid response groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was one of many points in which the temperature rose at the table, including after Biss pressed when moderator Paris Schutz questioned Fine about an AIPAC-affiliated super PAC running ads to support her bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't know if you believe the words coming out of your own mouth,” Fine fired at Biss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Who will you be representing if you get elected?” Biss shot back later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the exact hypocrisy people are sick of in politics,\" Abughazaleh said.&lt;/p&gt;",

Delia Ramirez met face to face with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Wednesday in a combative closed-door meeting in Washington and told her in no uncertain terms — twice — that she'll work to impeach her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, spent about 35 minutes with Noem, who also brought her son to the meeting and was seated behind the secretary. Noem in December told Ramirez at a committee hearing that she would meet with her after repeated requests — despite the Ramirez accusing the agency head of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/12/11/kristi-noem-testimony-congress-delia-ramirez-tammy-duckworth-trump-troop-deployments\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;violating court orders and lying to the public.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It began and ended with the Illinois Democrat warning Noem that her days in the administration could be numbered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I said to her, ‘I want to be pretty clear with you as we get started. I'm going to tell you everything I have said to you on record, and it's important for you to hear this directly from me. One, I continue to call for your removal,’’ Ramirez told the Sun-Times. “‘I expect that you resign. That if you don't resign or get impeached, I also recognize that your days may be numbered,’ which I believe they are. However, she is still the secretary. She clearly holds that position, and as such that I expected her to execute her oath of office and abide by the law of the United States of America.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the meeting, DHS said in a statement that Noem regularly meets with members of Congress, regardless of their party. But a spokesperson also placed blame on Democrats for the latest shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope that the Congresswoman puts the same amount of energy into funding DHS so we can do our work to protect Americans from threats from terrorists, criminals and public safety threats as she has writing letters to the Secretary to resign,” a spokesperson said. “Every day this shutdown continues, Democrat members continue to get paid while they put our national security second to politics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez came equipped with what she called \"bare minimum actions.\" They included asking Noem to re-establish  protected areas, including churches, schools and hospitals — in accordance with  a 2021 memorandum by former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. She also asked Noem to establish and codify use of force standards, arguing the department has been empowered through a lack of oversight and too much latitude to violate rights under the pretense of security. Ramirez is leading an effort to statutorily mandate DHS’ use of force policy. According to Ramirez, Noem told her that the department has a use of force report procedure and said it is covered in training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another request was for Noem to revoke a warrantless home entry memo, a controversial policy that has allowed ICE agents to enter homes without a judicial warrant — and asked that DHS respect laws and regulations, including vehicle registration laws that prevent swapping or changing license plates. In the wake of reports of federal immigration officers driving cars without proper license plates or modified plates, Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias in October created a tipline to collect and investigate license plate violations. The announcement came two weeks after the Sun-Times sent him proof of DHS officers driving on public streets &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/10/09/federal-immigration-officers-ice-dhs-license-plates-immigration\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;without one or both Illinois license plates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez also told Noem federal agents must abide by court orders, but Ramirez said Noem asserted that agents are indeed following court orders. When Ramirez pushed back, Noem asked for more details on specific court orders they’re violating. Ramirez referenced DHS agents using chemical weapons at least four times, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/10/16/judge-hauling-ice-official-into-court-as-aggressive-tactics-continue-despite-her-order-im-not-blind\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;despite court orders from U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a discussion about detention centers, Ramirez mentioned reports across the country of people who did not receive timely medical care while detained, and of some of her constituents who detailed food shortages at facilities. Noem denied to Ramirez that people are not receiving medical care, and she asked for a specific list of people who have complained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noem also told Ramirez that there are plans to “consolidate” some of the country’s 225 detention centers. She did not specifically reference Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez detailed incidents in Chicago in which people were tear-gassed going into a grocery store just one block from a school, children being rushed out of school playgrounds and chemical agents being sprayed near children. She also talked about drop-in visits by federal immigration agents at area hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I said to her, ‘You continue to deny what your agents are doing on the ground, but I'm going to tell you what I have seen with my own eyes that your agents have done,’” Ramirez said. “She acted like she had no idea what I was talking about, as if she did not know that she had agents in the hospital for days as they were waiting for one of my constituents, who had been harmed as they were attempting to detain him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez also told Noem about &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=jessie+fuentes+arrest+sun-times&amp;amp;oq=jessie+fuentes+&amp;amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCAgAEEUYJxg7MggIABBFGCcYOzIGCAEQRRg5MhAIAhAuGK8BGMcBGIAEGI4FMgcIAxAAGIAEMgcIBBAAGIAEMgcIBRAAGIAEMgcIBhAAGIAEMgYIBxBFGDzSAQgzODgzajBqN6gCALACAA&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Ald. Jessie Fuentes’ being handcuffed by agents at a Humboldt Park hospital&lt;/a&gt; as she came to check on that constituent in October. Fuentes asked agents if they had signed a judicial warrant and then was shoved by one agent, who was fully masked and not wearing any identification, according to a video posted to social media. After her third question about a judicial warrant, the alderperson was handcuffed. Fuentes was ultimately released — but has since filed a federal tort claim seeking $100,000 in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramirez said Noem repeatedly told her to let her know \"when these things are happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You and I both know she knows what is happening, and she has chosen to ignore them,\" Ramirez said. \"So she's accountable.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

We are used to playing in games like this, so it didn’t affect us as much as Notre Dame.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-cd0000\" name=\"image-cd0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9711490/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2F93%2Feb08bf3c414d8a8e611178cbc096%2Fob-cst-022626-7007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fb04506/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2F93%2Feb08bf3c414d8a8e611178cbc096%2Fob-cst-022626-7007.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aaa9057/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2F93%2Feb08bf3c414d8a8e611178cbc096%2Fob-cst-022626-7007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"St. Patrick&amp;#x27;s Omar Ajanovic, left, drives toward the basket during the Shamrocks victory over Notre Dame.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aaa9057/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2F93%2Feb08bf3c414d8a8e611178cbc096%2Fob-cst-022626-7007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/657df94/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2F93%2Feb08bf3c414d8a8e611178cbc096%2Fob-cst-022626-7007.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aaa9057/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1122+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2F93%2Feb08bf3c414d8a8e611178cbc096%2Fob-cst-022626-7007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Patrick’s Omar Ajanovic, left, drives toward the basket during the Shamrocks victory over Notre Dame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen Cunningham/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Patrick (26-4) held the Dons (14-17) without a field goal for the first 11:30 of the game and led 32-7 at halftime and 42-9 midway through the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Notre Dame] just had trouble with the pressure of it all,” McPartlin said. “We did a good job staying on the ball no matter where it went.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McPartlin led the Shamrocks with 14 points and six rebounds. Neely added 13 points and four rebounds and senior Joseph Costanzo scored 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is the last ride for the three of us and we made sure to keep the underclassmen focused,” Costanzo said. “This was a big game, and we struggled against Notre Dame at home.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costanzo was injured playing football in his junior year and didn’t have a large role in the run to Champaign last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I missed a lot last year, and I put a lot of hard work in to come back from that injury, and it all paid off,” Costanzo said. “I’ve had so much fun this season playing with these guys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emran Alispahic, a 6-3 freshman, led Notre Dame with 14 and senior Carmen Meccia added six points and five rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Patrick has an extremely difficult playoff path and will face No. 12 New Trier in the regional final on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is going to be a rough game here at their place,” McPartlin said. “But we are experienced with the pressure and now we have a feel for the court. Hopefully we can come out on top.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey, who picked up his 700th win this season, has been St. Patrick’s coach since 1994.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t remember a game against Notre Dame this lopsided in a while,” Bailey said. “I’m sure somewhere along the line there was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But this team has done this all year. They’ve been the same team for every game. There are no highs or lows. We don’t play any differently whether it is Notre Dame or Curie. We play our style of ball. That is a credit to our guys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Notre Dame and St. Patrick ready to go.

Cactus League game outcomes in February are no measure of how teams will be equipped to win in April, not when front-line players are playing every other day and for half a game. Not when minor-league campers are slapping hands in victorious handshake lines while top-salaried players are grilling steaks or playing golf, oblivious to the game’s outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you’re the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox\"   &gt;White Sox&lt;/a&gt;, the triple-digit losers of 2023, ‘24 and ‘25, there’s no harm in being attached to a kinda-cute 4-2 record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on the process and the things we’re doing before that result,” manager Will Venable said after the Sox opened spring training with three straight wins. “Winning isn’t something that you just flip a switch, you know? It is important that we finish these games and do the things up to the end of these games that lead to winning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’d be hard-pressed to remember the Sox’ record last spring (11-19). All associated with the team are trying to forget the 60-102 mark during the regular season. For what it’s worth, that 3-0 start this spring was the first one since 2004, a year before the Sox won the World Series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, 4-2 in spring training beats 0-6, especially for a team stained by defeat but believing it’s ready to take the initial baby steps toward becoming a contender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s always great to get the result, and we want to win every one of these games,” Venable said. “We’re competitive and we know that wins matter. Create habits that lead to good results. It’s nice having those upfront here, and we want to continue getting as many as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything to change the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is probably the most exciting it’s been since I’ve been here, as far as what we can do this year,” said outfielder Andrew Benintendi, entering the fourth year of his five-year contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A culture and routine of losing is the last thing anyone wants to become accustomed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No, hell no,” Benintendi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Special guest&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;White Sox 2005 World Series second baseman Tadahito Iguchi was at camp, having a particular interest in Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am very happy that he picked the White Sox,” Iguchi said. “We’re looking forward to the Japanese fans getting to know the White Sox better. They are going to pay attention to Murakami.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first Japanese-born position player to win the World Series, Iguchi managed the Chiba Lotte Marines for five seasons and now works for Japanese media (NHK Japan) as a studio analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Murakami was already a big star,” Iguchi said. “He already has successful records in Japan, so he doesn’t have to change anything. Just be yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Acuna leaves with cut&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Center fielder Luisangel Acuna needed four stitches for a cut above his left eyebrow suffered while sliding head first into second base on a successful steal against the Reds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquired from the Mets in the Luis Robert trade, Acuna (3-for-7 this spring) had two singles before exiting. Before the game, Venable said Acuna “looks really good” in center field, where he has appeared in only two games in the majors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first step-stuff, pre-pitch stuff we’ve been working on,” Venable said, “He’s been out there this winter. It’s been kind of fine-tuning things for him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primarily an infielder with the Mets, Acuna is also working on throwing from different arm slots from the outfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reds 3, Sox 2&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortstop Colson Montgomery, back after missing two days with an illness, looked healthy homering against non-roster invitee Lyon Richardson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• In his second to last tuneup before leaving for the World Baseball Classic,  first baseman Murakami went 1-for-3 with a strikeout. Murakami (.385) is 4-for-13 with no homers and five strikeouts going into Thursday's game against the Dodgers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Pitching in his first game, right-hander Davis Martin said he felt in sync for the first time this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It felt like it was a best version of myself so far in camp, so it's exciting and something to build off of going forward,” Martin said after allowing a run (Sal Stewart homer) in two innings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even better was righty Jonathan Cannon, pitching three perfect innings with one strikeout as he vies for a rotation spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• On deck: Sox at Dodgers, 2:05 p.m., Thursday, Glendale, Sean Newcombe vs. Tyler Glasnow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageListL\" data-module

Excited observers on social media noted them, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox\"   &gt;White Sox’&lt;/a&gt; big right-hander, pitching in relief for the first time in five years, unleashed five pitches at 100 mph in his Cactus League debut against the Brewers on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s great, but they don’t mean everything,” McDougal said. “You want to put the best out there that you can and the numbers are great but the results are better. It’s great I can do this or do that but am I getting outs? That’s your job as a pitcher.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDougal pitched two scoreless innings with two strikeouts and earned a save, so all was well. The White Sox are projecting the 2021 fifth-round pick to land a spot in a near-future starting rotation, which wasn’t the case after he went 0-11 with a 6.04 ERA between two levels of Class A in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A punch in the mouth” and a wakeup call, McDougal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He would bounce back with a strong season at High-A Winston-Salem and Double-A Birmingham in 2025, boosting his ranking among Sox prospects to No. 7, according to MLB Pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the 2026 rotation is anything but set or close to formidable as of now, a stable of young arms, including first-round left-handers Noah Schultz and Hagen Smith, right-hander Grant Taylor and McDougal provides hope. All are in the ears-open learning phase of their promising careers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying to be a sponge, trying to learn as much as I can from these guys who’ve done it,” said McDougal, in his first big-league camp after getting added to the Sox 40-man roster in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He earned that after posting a 3.26 ERA over 28 starts evenly divided between Winston-Salem and Birmingham last season, with 136 strikeouts and 49 walks in 113 1/3 innings last season. “Guys who maybe broke a camp or got called up in the middle of the year, listening to them and trying to get my bearings for how to go about things because you need to be prepared for that big jump from the minor leagues to the big leagues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it happens is to be determined for McDougal, who also features a curveball, slider and changeup. The slider is a pitch to land for a strike and the curve, he said, is a bigger breaking pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fastball, though, is what caused the commotion Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People talk about it, for sure but it’s not something we’re super homed in on,” McDougal said of the triple-digit achievements. “It’s great, it’s awesome, but it’s also February, you know what I mean? We have to sustain that for two weeks, for eight months. It’s not a goal. The goal is to get outs, roll the batting order over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitching out of the pen “was kind of wild, it was a rush and it’s like you have the freedom to go out there and let it eat,” McDougal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s believed to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Everyone is different,” McDougal said. “Some people can do that, others it takes time to get into their velo ranges. But the biggest thing is never to baby it, try to be someone you’re not. And allow your body to do what it wants to do, that is probably the healthiest thing you can do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manager Will Venable has seen numerous pitchers airing it out already, including Grant Taylor who touched 100 multiple times his first time out. Jordan Hicks hit 100 three times against the Reds on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s fine by Venable, who expects to see pitchers in competition-for-jobs mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not sure anything I can say can help regulate that,” Venable said. “You get out there between the lines and these guys are going to do what they do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Envisioning the 6-5 McDougal doing what he does as a starter “is really attractive,” Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Great stuff. Very competitive and a lot of energy and competitive spirit on the field, which is great to see. With him, it’s about throwing strikes. When he’s in the zone, what that looks like, want to encourage him to stay in the zone because he has great stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div

A timeline for the test wasn’t provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to begin laying the early groundwork for our ride-hailing operations in Chicago, and look forward to serving the city in the future,” the company wrote on its blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayor Brandon Johnson’s office says the city was given a heads up. The Chicago test comes a day after the company announced it was dispatching its robotaxis in four more cities in Texas and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As of now, autonomous vehicles have not been authorized within the City of Chicago or the State of Illinois,” Johnson’s office said in a statement. “The City looks forward to engaging with commuters, workers, transit advocates and industry leaders as we pursue constructive dialogue with our partners in Springfield and an equitable path forward.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Rep. Kam Buckner, D-Chicago, has filed a bill in Springfield to allow autonomous vehicles to be tested in Cook County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This progress is a vital step toward safer streets and more accessible transportation for all our neighborhoods,\" Buckner was quoted as saying in a statement from Waymo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has touted the service as a way to combat drunk driving and give autonomy to epileptic residents who can’t drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckner didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waymo’s robotaxis have experienced problems that have triggered community backlashes and regulatory inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year in San Francisco, a Waymo robotaxi ran over and killed a 9-year-old cat beloved around its neighborhood. Many of the self-driving vehicles later contributed to traffic jams during an extended power outage when they stalled at intersections with darkened traffic signals. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating complaints in Austin, Texas, about Waymo robotaxis operating unsafely around school buses carrying children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Waymo was first granted California permits in 2018, the West coast state rewrote some of its laws earlier this year after police in San Bruno, south of San Francisco, tried to ticket a self-driving vehicle for an illegal U-turn earlier this year. The police department said in a social media post that officers stopped the vehicle, but did not write a ticket as their “citation books don’t have a box for ‘robot,’” opting instead to contact Waymo about the “glitch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christina Whitehouse, founder of the cyclist advocacy group Bike Lane Uprising, said the company started off on the wrong foot by unloading its initial fleet in a bike lane, per videos posted to social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It shows they didn't put any effort into how they're going to be running this, and they'll do whatever they want while they're here,” Whitehouse said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had a list of concerns, namely “opaque” operations and reporting, worrying that more cyclists could be hit with less accountability. A California cyclist is &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://bayareabicyclelaw.com/bay-area-bicycle-law-files-lawsuit-against-waymo-and-alphabet-after-san-francisco-bike-lane-collision/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;currently suing the company&lt;/a&gt; after a passenger opened the door after the vehicle parked in a bike lane, hitting the cyclist and throwing her off her bike, only to be hit by another Waymo vehicle that was pulling over to drop off a passenger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California’s DMVs have been regulating the company’s vehicles for eight years. But the state's regulations for robotaxi companies say they only have to report crashes during testing, which must be reported within 10 days, and an annual report on “disengagements,” or when a human driver manually takes over the car. Revisions to the rules are expected later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost is another question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from Obi, a rideshare price comparison company, found that Waymo rides were an average of 12.7% &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://rideobi.com/tesla/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;more expensive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than an Uber and 27.3% more expensive than a Lyft. However, the price gap is smaller for shorter rides — all of which are more expensive than the city’s transit system, which Whitehouse worried would lose legislative attention or resources to a “new and shiny distraction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It would be great if we could put this energy into the public transportation system,” Whitehouse said. “It has been put on the backburner for so many years, and (public transportation) has the opportunity to be great, accessible and affordable for people. … It would be great if we had working elevators at our CTA stations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contributing: Associated Press&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

They also take five hours of academic classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But under the potential new structure, there would be 30 minutes less of conservatory instruction and those lessons would be embedded throughout the day. Chicago Public Schools officials say they have to shorten the school’s day to comply with union agreements, but students will have the opportunity to participate in up to 100 minutes of additional arts instruction after school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In order to make it sustainable and to have the program be part of the CPS family of fine and performing arts schools, there are certain guardrails and things that need to be changed,” Conrad Timbers-Ausar, CPS’ acting chief portfolio officer, said during a virtual community meeting about the transition Wednesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS did not permit reporters for the Sun-Times and WBEZ to attend the meeting, but we obtained an audio recording of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents and teachers expressed frustration at that explanation, saying the district hadn’t been creative enough in looking for ways to maintain the current conservatory model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Making it an after-school program does not keep it ChiArts,” one parent said during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/11/03/chicago-school-board-chiarts-epic-budgets\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;The school board voted to absorb ChiArts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in November after the private manager of the contract school, which is similar to a charter school, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2025/10/03/chiarts-board-not-renewing-contract-with-cps-citing-unsustainable-deficit-sparking-questions-about-future\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;decided it could no longer run it, citing financial deficits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. More than 530 students attend the school from across the city. Students audition to get in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the Sun-Times, Timbers-Ausar said the presentation wasn't a firm plan but rather an outline for how to maintain the instructional time afforded by the conservatory model while abiding by state law, district policies and other limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also takes into account the district's own financial troubles as it faces a deficit of more than $500 million headed into next school year, he said. The district plans to seek more feedback before coming up with a concrete plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How students are taught through the conservatory is also likely to shift. The school hires professional artists to instruct students in their disciplines. But when CPS runs the school, a state-certified teacher needs to oversee the classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district is recommending that licensed teachers pair up with teaching artists to satisfy graduation requirements. Timbers-Ausar said the district is working to help teaching artists stay on at the new school. As the new school begins to hire staff, current teachers and teaching artists will be first in line for interviews, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Casey Fuess was introduced as the school’s incoming principal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuess is a former choir director at Lindblom Math &amp;amp; Science Academy who spent the last five years as an assistant principal at CPS’ virtual academy, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyfuess/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;according to his LinkedIn profile. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When CPS runs the school, it will be funded like the district’s other 72 fine and performing arts schools. Currently, CPS pays for the academic portion of a student's day, while the money for ChiArts’ conservatory program comes from private donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of the school will likely have to change due to trademark issues, Timbers-Ausar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parent Isabela Cabrera said in an interview that the conservatory model has provided emotional stability for her daughter, who is a freshman at ChiArts. She travels to the school in Humboldt Park from the South Shore neighborhood, but said the program makes the long commute worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You see the kids coming out of school very happy, enjoying life,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cabrera and other parents said they will continue to advocate to keep the conservatory program unchanged by organizing protests and pushing state legislators to allow the school to have longer hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of parents, students and staff plans to demonstrate outside the school on March 3 to call on the district to work with the school community to preserve the current conservatory model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have to keep fighting for this,” Cabrera said.&lt;/p&gt;",

My four siblings stuck to the straight and narrow. We stayed close and loving, though. We are old now, and they all lead very comfortable lives. I, however, became injured and gravely ill. I could no longer work and now live on supplemental security income and food stamps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My siblings all give generously to food banks and homeless charities, even putting some homeless people up in hotels, which is great. But not one of them thinks to ask me if I have enough food or anything. I'm really hurt. Luckily, my affordable housing will offer some food for the residents, so I'm OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should I say anything to my siblings? Occasionally, in the past, they have helped me, like buying me a chest of drawers or some other minor thing. They could easily support me if they wanted to. Should I just be grateful for that? — &lt;i&gt;UNDERPERFORMING IN CALIFORNIA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR UNDERPERFORMING:&lt;/b&gt; Your relatives are not mind readers. If you need help, speak up, explain the problem and ask for help in plain English. The worst they can do is refuse, and you will be no worse off than you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; I'm worried about my husband's grief response. His mom collapsed and died in our driveway. At the time, I responded quickly. I made sure everyone was fed and paid for the funeral service. That was all fine. But now, I don't understand why he's not grieving. I love my husband very much, but this has me confused. Please advise. — &lt;i&gt;LETTING IT OUT IN OREGON&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR LETTING IT OUT:&lt;/b&gt; Please accept my sympathy for the shocking loss of your mother-in-law. We are not clones in the way we respond to death. Everyone does it differently, including your husband. If his mother was a strong influence in his life, he will feel her absence. If he's still eating and sleeping well and is able to concentrate, do not let this absence of emotion worry you. This is his journey, and if anything changes, your doctor can refer him to a grief support group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; I am a disabled person. When I go to doctors' offices or restaurants, there are usually two doors to get in. Sometimes, if someone is coming in or out, they will hold the door open for me. However, when they do, almost every time, another person will push past me, almost knocking me down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can I say to them about their rudeness? One of these days they might be in my position and need someone to hold the door for them. The next time it happens, I'm going to tell them \"The door was held open for the disabled person, not for you. Be glad you can walk well!\" What would you say, Abby? I can't believe how rude the country is getting. — &lt;i&gt;TRYING TO GET THROUGH IN VIRGINIA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR TRYING:&lt;/b&gt; A better word than \"rude\" to use would be \"entitled.\" If it happened to me, I would say loudly that the door was held for me because of my disability. Then I would add how fortunate I felt not to have been injured again this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

But all of them restrict presidential action by specifying acceptable rationales, requiring agency investigations, or limiting the size, scope, or duration of tariff hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump's attempt to avoid those \"careful constraints\" prompted a richly deserved rebuke. Roberts, a George W. Bush appointee, concluded that Trump's reading of IEEPA &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://reason.com/2026/02/20/gorsuch-blasts-thomas-alito-and-kavanaugh-for-favoring-trumps-illegal-tariffs/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;ran afoul&lt;/a&gt; of the \"major questions\" doctrine, which &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12077\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the executive branch can exercise delegated powers of \"vast 'economic and political significance'\" only with clear congressional approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Trump appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, agreed that the president could not meet that test. \"The Constitution lodges the Nation's lawmaking powers in Congress alone, and the major questions doctrine safeguards that assignment against executive encroachment,\" Gorsuch &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-1287_4gcj.pdf#page=28\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in his concurring opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under that doctrine, \"the President must identify clear statutory authority for the extraordinary delegated power he claims,\" Gorsuch wrote. \"That is a standard he cannot meet,\" Gorsuch continued, because Congress \"did not clearly surrender to the President the sweeping tariff power he seeks to wield.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three Democratic appointees on the Court — Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson — saw no need to rely on the major questions doctrine. But they &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-1287_4gcj.pdf#page=78\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; that the IEEPA cannot reasonably be read as conferring the untrammeled authority that Trump perceived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By joining Sotomayor, Kagan and Jackson in rejecting his power grab, Trump &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://reason.com/2026/02/23/trumps-tantrum-over-the-tariff-decision-highlights-his-narcissistic-authoritarianism/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;averred&lt;/a&gt;, Gorsuch and Barrett became \"an embarrassment to their families,\" revealing themselves as \"fools and lapdogs for the RINOs (Republicans In Name Only) and the radical-left Democrats.\" But that assessment had nothing to do with the quality of their reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump's condemnation instead hinged on the fact that Gorsuch and Barrett had the temerity to vote against the president who appointed them. Unlike Trump, they understand that justices have a higher duty than obedience to the president's will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jacob Sullum is a senior editor at Reason magazine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-6b0000\" name=\"module-6b0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s cleansing, almost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-d40000\" name=\"html-embed-module-d40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0T3wUvOk9cZxMf0Tg34ESh?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mäkelä eases into his role at the CSO, he’s stepping into one of the most visible cultural perches in the city and in classical music at large. He appears to bring to his new job in Chicago a curiosity about the arts that goes beyond his own medium of music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has compared his&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/12/31/notable-chicagoans-spotify-wrapped/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;favorite recordings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to works by Raphael and&amp;nbsp;Botticelli and is&amp;nbsp;an amateur&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DJQOZ60AKtI/?img_index=1\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;photographer,&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;snapping street scenes and portraits of his fellow musicians. His concerts of Hector Berlioz’s “Harold in Italy” last fall were almost theatrical, as he encouraged soloist Antoine Tamestit to rove around the stage as both actor and musician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not coincidentally, the home base of the other top orchestra he leads in 2027, Amsterdam’s Royal Concertgebouw, faces the Rijksmuseum, another world-class art collection — just as the CSO does the Art Institute. (Last year, the CSO became &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/culture-the-arts/classical/2025/05/15/gustav-mahler-festival-chicago-symphony-orchestra-comic\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;the first American orchestra invited to the prestigious Mahler Festival&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, held at the Concertgebouw.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mäkelä credits his parents with taking him to art museums early on. By the time he began touring as a conductor, at just 18, visiting the world’s great collections had become “a habit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where there was a good orchestra, there was most likely a good museum,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On afternoons when Mäkelä can slip across Michigan Avenue, he finds himself revisiting the same favorites in the Art Institute’s vast collection. (“I’m a very boring person,” he deadpans.) On a recent weekday, WBEZ/Sun-Times tagged along while he retraced his usual route. Along for the journey was Rebecca Long, the Art Institute’s specialist in Spanish and Italian art before 1750.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-740000\" name=\"image-740000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/112b16b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F32%2Ffe%2Fee9c6629445288af32a944238cae%2Fklausarttour-260301-39.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d360100/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F32%2Ffe%2Fee9c6629445288af32a944238cae%2Fklausarttour-260301-39.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c86fbe2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F32%2Ffe%2Fee9c6629445288af32a944238cae%2Fklausarttour-260301-39.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Klaus Makela, Music Director of the CSO, (left) and Rebecca J.

Claudio Monteverdi, the pioneering opera composer whose works bridged the Renaissance and Baroque period, is a favorite. So is Johann Sebastian Bach, whose St. Matthew Passion he conducts with Concertgebouw in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The influence of those composers on classical music is as palpable as that of the Italian masters on Western art. Indeed, when Mäkelä was in Chicago last December, he returned to this canvas by Botticelli — an artist whose sense of “harmony and balance” he admires — “again and again, every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me, this is so touching,” he says. “There is such incredible beauty that stays with you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Painted between 1475 and 1485, “Virgin and Child” is “quintessential” for Botticelli’s early career, says Long. Like other examples from the period, it was intended not for public view but for private display in the home of a well-to-do, nonroyal family in Florence — likely bankers or merchants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-190000\" name=\"image-190000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aa6c0e6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x3152+0+296/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2F67%2Fc7f9c61645ce97ee2b32ed85abaf%2Fcso20250424-218.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9b4fe21/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x3152+0+296/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2F67%2Fc7f9c61645ce97ee2b32ed85abaf%2Fcso20250424-218.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/51c9790/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x3152+0+296/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2F67%2Fc7f9c61645ce97ee2b32ed85abaf%2Fcso20250424-218.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Klaus Mäkelä conducts the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in April 2025. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/51c9790/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x3152+0+296/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2F67%2Fc7f9c61645ce97ee2b32ed85abaf%2Fcso20250424-218.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/01686de/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x3152+0+296/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2F67%2Fc7f9c61645ce97ee2b32ed85abaf%2Fcso20250424-218.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/51c9790/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x3152+0+296/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa6%2F67%2Fc7f9c61645ce97ee2b32ed85abaf%2Fcso20250424-218.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mäkelä eases into his role at the CSO, he’s stepping into one of the most visible cultural perches in the city and in classical music at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;2025 Todd Rosenberg/Todd Rosenberg Photography&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Virgin and Child” precedes a reactionary episode in Florentine history, and Botticelli’s own output. A firebrand monk named Girolamo Savonarola predicted an impending apocalypse and believed that people should reject the increasing secularism of the Renaissance ahead of Judgment Day. Streets blazed with “bonfires of the vanities,” in which people burned art, books and cosmetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not unlike the Y2k thing,” Long says. “Society got a little bit manic about the year 1500.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Botticelli followed suit. In his later years, his paintings became more retrograde, as though rejecting modernity and reaching back to precedents from Gothic art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Musical pairing: &lt;/b&gt;Naturally, anything by &lt;b&gt;Monteverdi &lt;/b&gt;(1567–1643).&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“I love a composer that, in a way, is so ahead of his time, but then also looks back,” Mäkelä says. “When I look at this painting, of course, one recognizes the elements that you can date.

(There’s been one historic exception: He rushed to the gallery last spring only to find “Assumption” had been loaned to the Museo del Prado in Madrid. It returned to Chicago in summer 2025.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Greco — born Doménikos Theotokópoulos in Crete — painted church icons following the Byzantine style: dark undertones, contrasting lustrous overlays, and subjects with stoic, cookie-cutter expressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Theotokópoulos moved to Italy, he completely reversed course. He adopted the Mannerist style of the late High Renaissance, his color palette vivified, and his human figures became highly individualized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He picks up this basically Venetian way of painting,” Long says. “I don't know of another artist who just completely said, ‘Nope, I'm not working that way anymore.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Greco proudly signed the work using a trompe-l'œil-style visual trick, painting his name and the date on what appears to be a handwritten piece of paper stuck to the painting’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Musical pairing:&lt;/b&gt; Mäkelä proposes two composers, and a band. Austrian composer &lt;b&gt;Arnold Schoenberg&lt;/b&gt; (1874–1951) changed his style from lush post-romanticism to a more mathematical mode of composition which “follows a completely different logic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Igor Stravinsky&lt;/b&gt; (1882–1971) also tilted from romanticism into modernism in his works for the Ballets Russes, culminating in 1913’s “Rite of Spring.” (The CSO plays that work March 5 and 6, after returning from its East Coast tour.) Later in his career, Stravinsky would pivot again, deriving musical influence from earlier centuries, much as Botticelli did. Before his death, he pivoted yet again, adopting Schoenberg’s mathematical schema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These shifts happened over a period of decades for each composer. But Mäkelä argues that &lt;b&gt;the Beatles&lt;/b&gt; probably transformed fastest, transforming from clean-cut, pop-rock anthems to experimental psychedelia over the course of the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you think about it, within 10 years, [they] go from that to &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;? I mean, it's actually incredible,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-820000\" name=\"image-820000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0bdea4e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F44%2Fd4f0319a4bbd8203b5a3daeafa82%2Fklausarttour-260301-21.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/002a427/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F44%2Fd4f0319a4bbd8203b5a3daeafa82%2Fklausarttour-260301-21.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/291fe7b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F44%2Fd4f0319a4bbd8203b5a3daeafa82%2Fklausarttour-260301-21.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"“Ad astra (To the Stars)” by Akseli Gallen-Kallela at the Art Institute of Chicago, Tuesday, Feb. 17, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/291fe7b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F44%2Fd4f0319a4bbd8203b5a3daeafa82%2Fklausarttour-260301-21.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aec6e0d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F44%2Fd4f0319a4bbd8203b5a3daeafa82%2Fklausarttour-260301-21.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/291fe7b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdb%2F44%2Fd4f0319a4bbd8203b5a3daeafa82%2Fklausarttour-260301-21.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ad Astra” features not only Akseli Gallen-Kallela’s distinctive, Symbolism-inspired style but a gated frame, designed by the artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;“Ad Astra,” Akseli Gallen-Kallela&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mäkelä was born and raised in Helsinki, so, naturally, the hugely influential Finnish artist Akseli Gallen-Kallela&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;makes the maestro’s Art Institute shortlist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ad Astra” features not only Gallen-Kallela’s distinctive, Symbolism-inspired style but a gated frame, designed by the artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Gallen-Kallela created “Ad Astra” in the mid-1890s, Finland still bore the stamp of its occupying powers: It was part of the Russian Empire, and Swedish was its lingua franca. But Gallen-Kallela — who Finnicized his name from Axel Gallén — and his peers began looking towards the Finnish language and folk traditions to express a surging national identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major source of inspiration was the “Kalevala,” a Finnish folk epic first compiled and published in 1830.

Prior to that, it had remained in the Gallen-Kallela family and passed down through generations. Like Botticelli’s “Virgin and Child,” Gallen-Kallela created it for domestic use, displaying it during his daughter’s baptism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Musical pairing:&lt;/b&gt; The “Kalevala” was also a muse for Gallen-Kallela’s friend &lt;b&gt;Jean Sibelius &lt;/b&gt;(1865–1957), whose orchestral works put Finland on the classical music map. Sibelius composed his &lt;b&gt;“Lemminkäinen” suite &lt;/b&gt;at the same time Gallen-Kallela painted “Ad Astra,” depicting the travails of its titular folk hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lemminkäinen” was already top of mind for Mäkelä. In February, he was rehearsing the four-movement work with the CSO to take it to Carnegie Hall as part of the four-city American tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sibelius actually spoke Finnish with a [Swedish] accent,” Mäkelä says. “But it was very important for him to speak Finnish and create the identity of, or idea of, the Finnish soul.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-280000\" name=\"image-280000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ccd0e3a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Ffc%2F16b9b16e480b95f23cf7c7357d68%2Fklausarttour-260301-01.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1795163/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Ffc%2F16b9b16e480b95f23cf7c7357d68%2Fklausarttour-260301-01.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/831c4e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Ffc%2F16b9b16e480b95f23cf7c7357d68%2Fklausarttour-260301-01.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"“America Windows” by Marc Chagall at the Art Institute of Chicago, Tuesday, Feb. 17, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/831c4e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Ffc%2F16b9b16e480b95f23cf7c7357d68%2Fklausarttour-260301-01.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/426b237/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Ffc%2F16b9b16e480b95f23cf7c7357d68%2Fklausarttour-260301-01.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/831c4e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Ffc%2F16b9b16e480b95f23cf7c7357d68%2Fklausarttour-260301-01.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A European who now has a home base in the U.S., Mäkelä says he “can’t get enough of” Marc Chagall’s “America Windows.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;“America Windows,” Marc Chagall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mäkelä’s route at the Art Institute winds to a close at the Chagall windows, with their blue panels celebrating music, painting, literature, architecture, theater and dance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A European who now has a home base in the U.S., Mäkelä says he “can't get enough of” this late work by Chagall, who made his name as a painter but was also a prolific stained glass artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It feeds a different part of your soul than the other works,” Mäkelä says. “In classical music, everything is very impressive and very strong and vivid. But then, when you think about, like, ballet, the illusion of lightness is sometimes so much more impressive… I feel like Chagall captures that unbearable lightness of being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chagall created the “America Windows” to mark the United States’ bicentennial in 1976. The artist gifted it to the Art Institute of Chicago the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty years on, with the United States now celebrating its 250th anniversary, Long is still moved by what “America Windows” represents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f00000\" name=\"image-f00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/452af9f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5b%2Fed%2F0bb1c9e7481b97f2c5715a47ae4b%2Fklausarttour-260301-07.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c06b672/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5b%2Fed%2F0bb1c9e7481b97f2c5715a47ae4b%2Fklausarttour-260301-07.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3df7455/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F5b%2Fed%2F0bb1c9e7481b97f2c5715a47ae4b%2Fklausarttour-260301-07.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Rebecca J.

Take &lt;b&gt;Ludwig van Beethoven’s “Missa solemnis,”&lt;/b&gt; premiered three years before the composer’s death in 1827. Mäkelä, who conducted the work in Paris earlier this year, considers it “one of the two great masses ever written,” the other being Bach’s Mass in B minor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He started from the shadow of Haydn and classicism, and brought it [somewhere] completely different,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Also of note: &lt;/b&gt;Mäkelä leads &lt;b&gt;George Gershwin’s “An American in Paris” &lt;/b&gt;at Symphony Center on March 5 and 6, sharing the program with “Rite of Spring.”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The work makes Chagall’s journey in reverse — he had to flee France during World War II — but it reflects a similar infatuation, with bold colors and infectious buoyancy.&lt;/p&gt;",

Of the more than 11,000 wineries in the U.S. today, only about 1% are Black owned, Adisa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-f00000\" name=\"image-f00000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/48f461a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F74%2F37%2F578f6735479bb2fda307ad03819c%2Fwineclasses-260311-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9b1a4b7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F74%2F37%2F578f6735479bb2fda307ad03819c%2Fwineclasses-260311-09.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f52bb97/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F74%2F37%2F578f6735479bb2fda307ad03819c%2Fwineclasses-260311-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Sommelier Asha Adisa stands in Uvae Kitchen &amp;amp; Wine Bar on Saturday, Feb. 21, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f52bb97/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F74%2F37%2F578f6735479bb2fda307ad03819c%2Fwineclasses-260311-09.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f854675/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F74%2F37%2F578f6735479bb2fda307ad03819c%2Fwineclasses-260311-09.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f52bb97/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F74%2F37%2F578f6735479bb2fda307ad03819c%2Fwineclasses-260311-09.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sommelier Asha Adisa leads wine tastings at Uvae in Andersonville. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giacomo Cain/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just two days earlier at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://bottlesupchicago.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;BottlesUp!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in East Lake View, 40-odd fellow Chicagoans and I got schooled on Mexican wine — an emerging category with delicious exports that grace the lists of buzzy restaurants such as &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.mirrachicago.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Mirra&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.mitocaya.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Mi Tocaya Antojeria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://matildachicago.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Matilda&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, casual wine education in Chicago these days favors traditionally overlooked and under-the-radar makers and stories, and leans into nerdiness without pretense. It jumps headfirst into historical deep dives and tours lesser-known winemaking regions and globetrotting grapes; it embraces fun, sometimes oddball pairings like funky orange wine with stinky cheese and blind tastings with a “Heated Rivalry” theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wine industry may still be &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://daily.sevenfifty.com/silicon-valley-bank-wine-report-2026-takeaways/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;struggling&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but in Chicago, in-store wine education is alive and evolving beyond lessons rooted in the historic powerhouse regions found in California, France and Spain. There's a flourishing menu of classes representing viniculture from Baja and Hungary — and they are quickly finding an audience in our multicultural city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve done, gosh, I don't know, hundreds, maybe over a thousand events? — and pretty much all of them sell out,” said Melissa Zeman, owner of BottlesUp!. Since opening in 2019, this cheery storefront has hosted weekly 101 classes, from wine and cheese pairings and intros to wine from the Republic of Georgia to slightly sillier takes, like “Shuck Yourself,” marrying wine with oysters. In a combo dance lesson-wine class attendees learn four dance styles, each paired with a different wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-760000\" name=\"image-760000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d3ed169/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F67%2F68%2F953b4e21414a9cf6028b025f5836%2Fwineclasses-2602xx-4.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/994646b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F67%2F68%2F953b4e21414a9cf6028b025f5836%2Fwineclasses-2602xx-4.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/60b06e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F67%2F68%2F953b4e21414a9cf6028b025f5836%2Fwineclasses-2602xx-4.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"An assortment of wines and Champaign sit on shelves at BottlesUp! located at 3164 N Broadway in the Lake View neighborhood, Friday, Feb. 20, 2026. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/60b06e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F67%2F68%2F953b4e21414a9cf6028b025f5836%2Fwineclasses-2602xx-4.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab9abec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F67%2F68%2F953b4e21414a9cf6028b025f5836%2Fwineclasses-2602xx-4.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/60b06e8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F67%2F68%2F953b4e21414a9cf6028b025f5836%2Fwineclasses-2602xx-4.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since opening in 2019, BottlesUp! has hosted weekly 101 classes, from wine and cheese pairings to slightly sillier takes, like “Shuck Yourself,” marrying wine with oysters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At BottlesUp!’s “¡Mexican Wine!” night, we learned that the very existence of Mexican wine is a \"geographically fascinating conundrum,” per sommelier Alex Bliss from &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.grandcata.com/home\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Grand Cata&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He led the class alongside Gabi Medina from &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.chuchaquicocktails.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Chuchaqui Cocktails&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The proximity to the equator — south of the 30th parallel — does not preclude quality winemaking, Bliss said. We began in Baja with prickly, pear-scented brut cava and crushable orange wine that tasted like “pineapple!” as someone shouted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a slightly controversial move, Bliss poured a blend of Chardonnay with a touch of Chenin Blanc from Coahuilo with a quality that could be considered buttery — hearkening to associations with the dreaded over-oaked Napa Chards of the 1990s. It wasn’t due to oak aging, but in fact letting malolactic fermentation run its course, lending creaminess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What do you all think?” he asked archly. A handful made their displeasure known via facial expressions or by emptying their portion into the spit bucket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I love this wine,” he added, cementing the wonderfully, maddenly subjective nature of wine tasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing wine and food still represents a nice jumping-off point for beginner oenophiles. Indeed, during my reporting, several people suggested I pop by for a class at cheese shop and restaurant &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.beautifulrind.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Beautiful Rind&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where classes break down how to pair cheese not just with wine but beer, tea and even margaritas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things got nerdy from the outset at a sold-out wine and cheese pairing essentials class in late January, where all but three of the 20 attendees were first-timers. Anna Patrick, head of education and events and a cheesemonger, kicked things off as she always does — talking about how both cheese- and winemaking are processes of fermentation. Maybe that explains why they go so well together, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All the cheeses you’re tasting, and those in existence, start with the same four ingredients: milk; salt; rennet, which is an enzyme added to milk to start coagulation; and bacteria, which starts converting lactose into lactic acid,” Patrick said. “All wine is made from grapes, which are essentially pockets of sugar coated in yeast. When you crush a grape, it’s ready to become wine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-3f0000\" name=\"image-3f0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a7f231f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fec%2F40%2Fff7cbdac4213898036c557563307%2Fcheeselady-0805250066.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b02e8fa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fec%2F40%2Fff7cbdac4213898036c557563307%2Fcheeselady-0805250066.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/791be47/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fec%2F40%2Fff7cbdac4213898036c557563307%2Fcheeselady-0805250066.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The cheese selections at Beautiful Rind. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/791be47/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fec%2F40%2Fff7cbdac4213898036c557563307%2Fcheeselady-0805250066.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a1f8c57/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fec%2F40%2Fff7cbdac4213898036c557563307%2Fcheeselady-0805250066.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/791be47/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fec%2F40%2Fff7cbdac4213898036c557563307%2Fcheeselady-0805250066.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing wine and food represent a nice jumping-off point for beginner oenophiles.

Bucking the oft-repeated lament that young people aren’t into wine, attendees of Beautiful Rind’s classes skew pretty young, helped by the shop’s dine-in element, Freemire said. Of the roughly 13 classes the shop hosts each month, eight or nine of them contain a beverage element.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We sipped a rich, lemony white French blend of Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle between bites of tangy, fluffy fresh chèvre from Blakesville Creamery in Port Washington, Wis., that was still milk as of “three days ago,” Patrick said. A young woman raised her hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Are all white wines made from white grapes?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick paused for a moment, then launched into a brief explanation about how wine’s hue depends on whether and how long a wine is fermented with its skins, wherein lives its color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This detail popped into my head a few weeks later at Uvae, as Adisa poured Ashanta’s Pinot Noir Blanc, made from a grape typically used for red wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This wine was separated from its skins the moment pigmentation started to show,” Adisa said. They instructed us to close our eyes and sniff in search of familiar Pinot Noir notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can smell a red!” one attendee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s good,” Adisa replied with a laugh. “Smells like a red.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.maggiehennessy.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Maggie Hennessy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a Chicago-based food and drink writer whose work has appeared in The New York Times, Bon Appetit and Food &amp;amp; Wine.

Milwaukee Ave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Logan Square cheese shop hosts regular wine-and-cheese pairing classes that typically cost $68, including one covering the basics of wine and cheese pairing through five wines and five cheeses, and a popular series of “wine and rind” classes that dig into places (Italy, France) and styles (natural wine).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-ba0000\" name=\"image-ba0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f42c384/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fbf%2F42%2Fa61a3cf54ab1a6cf2175d8085d1b%2Fwineclasses-2602xx-21.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b0b0049/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fbf%2F42%2Fa61a3cf54ab1a6cf2175d8085d1b%2Fwineclasses-2602xx-21.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7d80f15/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fbf%2F42%2Fa61a3cf54ab1a6cf2175d8085d1b%2Fwineclasses-2602xx-21.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Some of the wines and Champaigns used in recent wine tasting classes sit on a table at BottlesUp! located at 3164 N.

Cottage Grove Ave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Black-owned Bronzeville Winery one-ups the monthly bottle club membership with themed programming that places said juice in a richer social, cultural and historical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I created the Wine Collective to intentionally break down barriers,” said Bronzeville Winery owner Cecilia Cuff. “Wine can feel intimidating. It can feel exclusive. I wanted to remove that distance and create a space where curiosity is welcomed. When we taste together, we talk. When we talk, we begin to understand each other. That is how connection begins.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiered Wine Collective membership includes Just Vibes ($45), which offers access to monthly meetups (typically capped at around 50 people) that feature discussion panels, guided tastings and discounts on retail bottles. Memberships that include bottle selections include the Enthusiastic Collective ($75) or Luxe Collective ($125). On March 30, wine and spirits expert and author Regine Rousseau, who founded &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://shallwewine.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Shall We Wine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, will lead a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/wine-collective-tasting-womens-history-month-featuring-regine-rousseau-tickets-1983558651322?aff=oddtdtcreator\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Women’s History Month tasting and discussion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of four women-made wines, touching on themes of access and representation in the wine industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://deepredwinemerchant.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deep Red Wine Merchant &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Avondale&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;2901 N. Milwaukee Ave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hipster spot in Avondale offers quarterly Wine 101 classes, plus introductions to lesser-known regions like Hungary and the Republic of Georgia as well as pairing events. Classes typically range from $50 to $75 and max out at eight people, but the shop will actually close to the public for high-demand events such as pairing sparkling wine with potato chips (and caviar!) to accommodate its 24-person maximum. In a seeming trend, “it’s rare for us to have a class that doesn't sell out,” said owner Dave Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.lemidiwine.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Le Midi Vins &amp;amp; Apero&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wicker Park&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;2108 W. Division St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprung from the whimsical mind of Le Midi co-founder and sommelier Seth Wilson, the lively classes ($55 to $100) at this Wicker Park wine bar-bottle shop hybrid lean playful and edgier. Think a blind tasting showdown of four North American wines versus four Eastern European wines with a “Heated Rivalry” theme, nodding to the relentlessly popular HBO Max show; or a tour of wines made with Bordeaux varietals outside France. “They’re a little more social, the tastings,” said co-founder Craig Perman, also of Perman Wine. “We keep Midi open during tastings, although we just put in acoustic ceiling tiles so you can hear better.

Though he says tastings lean pricey, Perman has been known to pop rare delights, like a bottle of Bodegas Vega Sicilia Valbuena that might fetch $600 at a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-ed0000\" name=\"image-ed0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2db3144/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb1%2Ff5%2Fd17d31b048e3bd644ea4865f44c8%2Fwineclasses-260311-02.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/21e0877/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb1%2Ff5%2Fd17d31b048e3bd644ea4865f44c8%2Fwineclasses-260311-02.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ab353a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb1%2Ff5%2Fd17d31b048e3bd644ea4865f44c8%2Fwineclasses-260311-02.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Wine class attendees smell and inspect wine at Uvae Kitchen &amp;amp; Wine Bar on Saturday, Feb. 21, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ab353a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb1%2Ff5%2Fd17d31b048e3bd644ea4865f44c8%2Fwineclasses-260311-02.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d2cb720/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb1%2Ff5%2Fd17d31b048e3bd644ea4865f44c8%2Fwineclasses-260311-02.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5ab353a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2500x1403+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb1%2Ff5%2Fd17d31b048e3bd644ea4865f44c8%2Fwineclasses-260311-02.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uvae in Andersonville hosts weekly sommelier-led classes in its private dining room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giacomo Cain/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://uvaechicago.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Uvae Kitchen &amp;amp; Wine Bar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Andersonville&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;5553 N.

The man said he was in the U.S. legally with a pending asylum case, a work permit and a driver’s license.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“An anonymous government is no government at all,” Goodwin wrote. “It cannot be held accountable. A masked agent freely uses force without justifying his actions and the public cannot name him to challenge his conduct. A regime of secret policing has no place in our society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the traffic stop violated the Fourth and Fifth amendments of the constitution. The ruling, issued Feb. 19, doesn’t bind courts in Chicago, which sit in a different federal appeals circuit. Still, lawyers said the opinion could serve as persuasive authority in cases challenging arrests by ICE or the Border Patrol in Illinois and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-2a0000\" name=\"image-2a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aba6b1c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8037x4511+0+425/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2F57%2F09cf2e5744cab4d08d91385a7686%2Fbovinoarrests-110125-021.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/df51d76/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8037x4511+0+425/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2F57%2F09cf2e5744cab4d08d91385a7686%2Fbovinoarrests-110125-021.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/46f2ae3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8037x4511+0+425/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2F57%2F09cf2e5744cab4d08d91385a7686%2Fbovinoarrests-110125-021.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"U.S. Border Patrol agents tell journalists and Edison Park residents to stay back while conducting a deportation operation on Oct. 31 in the 7400 block of North Oconto Avenue.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/46f2ae3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8037x4511+0+425/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2F57%2F09cf2e5744cab4d08d91385a7686%2Fbovinoarrests-110125-021.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/112286d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8037x4511+0+425/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2F57%2F09cf2e5744cab4d08d91385a7686%2Fbovinoarrests-110125-021.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/46f2ae3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8037x4511+0+425/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F96%2F57%2F09cf2e5744cab4d08d91385a7686%2Fbovinoarrests-110125-021.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Border Patrol agents tell journalists and Edison Park residents to stay back while conducting a deportation operation on Oct. 31 in the 7400 block of North Oconto Avenue.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers / Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bolster his reasoning, Goodwin pointed to a case that began in Chicago on a cold February night in 2013.  Joseph Doornbos, then 35, stepped off a Red Line train at the Wilson Avenue station in Uptown after his work day at a Loop law firm where he was a customer service manager. He was headed to a friend’s house to watch a Blackhawks game when three plainclothes Chicago police officers approached him outside the station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to court records, Doornbos said one of the cops, whom he described as disheveled, ordered him to stop but didn't identify himself as a police officer. Believing he was about to be robbed, he shouted for help, prompting bystanders to call 911. When Doornbos tried to flee, one officer tackled him and two others joined the struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officers contended that they stopped Doornbos because he was carrying an open beer can in a paper bag, an allegation he denied. During the arrest, police recovered $5 worth of marijuana from his coat pocket. Doornbos was charged with drug possession and resisting arrest but was acquitted after a Cook County trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sued the officers in federal court. He lost that lawsuit, but the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the verdict in 2016, finding the trial judge had improperly instructed jurors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The jury asked the judge whether plainclothes officers are required to identify themselves when they conduct a stop,” the appeals court wrote. “The judge said no. We conclude that the answer is yes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With limited exceptions, the court held, officers in plain clothes must identify themselves when initiating a stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Chicago officials agreed to pay $100,000 to settle the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question of identification has since taken on new urgency as immigration enforcement has intensified in several cities, including Chicago and Minneapolis. During a series of deportation operations here last year, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/11/14/ice-bovino-border-patrol-homeland-security-chicago-police-department\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;masked agents deployed tear gas and other crowd-control munitions against protesters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In two separate episodes last fall, masked officers shot people in vehicles: An immigrant driver was killed in Franklin Park, and a woman who’s a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/02/03/marimar-martinez-shot-border-patrol-chicago-speaks-out-after-good-pretti-deaths-i-am-their-voice\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. citizen was wounded in Brighton Park.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington earlier this month, House Democrats moved to partially withhold funding from the Department of Homeland Security, demanding changes to immigration enforcement practices, including a prohibition on masks. Congress remains at a stalemate on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his ruling, Goodwin said there’s a key difference between the Chicago case and what’s going on with DHS agents wearing masks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Immigration enforcement is distinguishable from the &lt;i&gt;Doornbos &lt;/i&gt;officer in a material way: We are not merely dealing with a plainclothes officer who fails to self-identify — we are dealing with groups of masked individuals arriving in unmarked vehicles, without badges or a means of discerning who they are. They are the problem that the court in &lt;i&gt;Doornbos &lt;/i&gt;foreshadowed: a presence indistinguishable from lawbreakers,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goodwin rejected the government’s position that masks are necessary to ensure the safety of the federal agents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\" https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/10/24/masked-agents-border-patrol-immigration-enforcement-dea-atf-trump-deportation\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Masked immigration agents erode trust and intimidate, former No. 2 DEA boss, others say&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-1d0000\" name=\"image-1d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4b80742/2147483647/strip/true/crop/377x212+0+83/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9e%2F21%2Ff6c90b1e4d6b8e8ba2f19c9d0074%2F1516994502428.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/74774f8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/377x212+0+83/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9e%2F21%2Ff6c90b1e4d6b8e8ba2f19c9d0074%2F1516994502428.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/28e4872/2147483647/strip/true/crop/377x212+0+83/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9e%2F21%2Ff6c90b1e4d6b8e8ba2f19c9d0074%2F1516994502428.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Attorney Torreya Hamilton.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/28e4872/2147483647/strip/true/crop/377x212+0+83/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9e%2F21%2Ff6c90b1e4d6b8e8ba2f19c9d0074%2F1516994502428.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b119358/2147483647/strip/true/crop/377x212+0+83/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9e%2F21%2Ff6c90b1e4d6b8e8ba2f19c9d0074%2F1516994502428.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/28e4872/2147483647/strip/true/crop/377x212+0+83/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9e%2F21%2Ff6c90b1e4d6b8e8ba2f19c9d0074%2F1516994502428.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney Torreya Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Torreya Hamilton, one of Doornbos’s&lt;b&gt;

It has long been a forbidden practice for an officer to hide his identity while acting on behalf of the government.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that the principle at stake is a basic one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Like the police officers in my case, these ICE and border patrol agents are government employees and therefore we are their employers,\" Hamilton said. “And we have every right to hold them accountable for their conduct, which we can’t do unless we know who they are.”&lt;/p&gt;",

She has stressed that the country still needs enforcement, but “not the enforcement that we have now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly and Stratton have said they would not confirm any nominations made by Trump, while Krishnamoorthi offered a more tempered response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnamoorthi said a “nonpartisan commission” should evaluate applicants.

Krishnamoorthi has raised an astounding $28.7 million for his Senate bid. The Federal Election Commission ranks Krishnamoorthi third nationwide in fundraising hauls, behind U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-NJ., who has raised $30.1 million and Sen. Jonathan Ossoff, D-Ga., who has raised $63.9 million. Krishnamoorthi &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2025/07/15/raja-krishnamoorthi-tv-ad-illinois-senate-robin-kelly-juliana-stratton\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;began airing TV ads in July&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and has blanketed the airwaves with several campaign ads on everything from fighting Trump to his economic plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratton got a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/elections/2026/01/31/juliana-stratton-jb-pritzker-campaign-contribution-5-million\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;boost from Pritzker,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; her longtime running mate. Pritzker gave a pro-Stratton super PAC called Illinois Future PAC $5 million that is being used to fund two TV ads in the final weeks of the campaign. Many had questioned whether Pritzker, a billionaire self-funder, would actually dole out cash for Stratton. Others  wonder if the timing, with the money received late last year, was too late to help Stratton’s campaign fight for voters’ attention amid Krishnamoorthi’s ad blitz. Stratton had $1.12 million cash on hand at the end of December — but the super PAC has boasted that fundraising has now exceeded $10 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly, who has raised $3.9 million for the bid and had $1.59 million cash on hand at the end of December, is also running a TV ad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond ads, Krishnamoorthi came under fire last year after the Sun-Times reported &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/the-watchdogs/2025/12/08/raja-krishnamoorthi-senate-campaign-donors-trump-allies-maga-money\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;he took in contributions from supporters of President Donald Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as from an executive at a company contracted by ICE. After the report, Krishnamoorthi ultimately donated $33,000 — money from Palantir chief technology officer Shyam Sankar — to three immigrant rights groups: Centro Romero, Progreso Progressivo and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Voters have full slate of choices &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly, who lives in south suburban Matteson, has &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/05/06/rep-robin-kelly-senate-bid-dick-durbin\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;represented the 2nd Congressional District since 2013&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and previously served in the Illinois House.

The fundraising leader called himself a “first-generation kid” who can stand up to bullies and billionaires. His economic policy includes a nationwide free lunch program, expanding the child tax credit and helping first-time homeowners get a refundable tax credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stratton, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/04/23/lt-gov-juliana-stratton-candidacy-us-senate-dick-durbin-seat\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;the first Democrat to enter the field,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said her path to the Senate may not be typical, “but then again, typical isn’t what we need right now.” She was quickly endorsed by Pritzker and Sen. Tammy Duckworth.

She says her mission is \"to restore integrity, justice, and purpose to public service.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dean is an activist, entrepreneur and litigator — and he calls himself \"a proud survivor of childhood sexual abuse.\" He says he's running because Illinois needs a senator who \"will shock the system into working for young people, working families, and our children’s futures and stand against fascism and for American freedom.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maxwell is an assistant research scientist and project engineer for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He has spent the last two years \"organizing to stop sending our tax dollars to Israel for its genocide in Gaza.\" He believes tax dollars should be spent on local communities, \"not bombing them overseas.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan is a Chicago Public Schools teacher and a U.S. Marine Corps veteran. He says that Trump's return and \"the Democratic Party's critical failures\" made him want to run for public office: \"We can no longer afford more machine politics, bowing to billionaires, or those who wait for 'their turn.'\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swann is a deacon and nonprofit leader.

The comptroller’s work directly affects the state’s credit ratings, which play into   the interest rates the state pays on borrowed money and, in turn, can influence the state’s budgetary decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-220000\" name=\"image-220000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/81d010c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4934x2769+0+260/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F54%2Ff8%2F897c5eaf49928486e8348a983c6c%2Fsenateslating-071925-36.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/06d7156/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4934x2769+0+260/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F54%2Ff8%2F897c5eaf49928486e8348a983c6c%2Fsenateslating-071925-36.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ccbb4de/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4934x2769+0+260/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F54%2Ff8%2F897c5eaf49928486e8348a983c6c%2Fsenateslating-071925-36.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Holly Kim, who is running for state comptroller, walks to the stage to give her remarks during slating for Cook County Democrats at IBEW Local 134, July 18, 2025.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ccbb4de/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4934x2769+0+260/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F54%2Ff8%2F897c5eaf49928486e8348a983c6c%2Fsenateslating-071925-36.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/30ff1a3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4934x2769+0+260/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F54%2Ff8%2F897c5eaf49928486e8348a983c6c%2Fsenateslating-071925-36.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ccbb4de/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4934x2769+0+260/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F54%2Ff8%2F897c5eaf49928486e8348a983c6c%2Fsenateslating-071925-36.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holly Kim, who is running for state comptroller, walks to the stage to give her remarks during slating for Cook County Democrats at IBEW Local 134, July 18, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim, 45, from Mundelein, said the state needs a “weathered sea captain at the wheel” — a description she says she fits. She steered the state’s third largest county through the pandemic as treasurer, which in Lake County operates similarly to comptroller. Kim’s own financial hardship as a single mother in college, and a victim of identity theft, has shaped her into “a fierce protector of people and their money,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the three legislators said Illinois requires a comptroller who has a background in state government and understands the complexities of massive budgets during a crucial moment of financial unpredictability. The Trump administration has frozen or cut billions of dollars in federal funding to Illinois for various services over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d30000\" name=\"image-d30000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d3dcaff/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2477x1390+0+130/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fec%2Ff0%2F8b56ab54481896906a050c107ea1%2Felection2018-412.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e4801ef/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2477x1390+0+130/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fec%2Ff0%2F8b56ab54481896906a050c107ea1%2Felection2018-412.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e97d815/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2477x1390+0+130/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fec%2Ff0%2F8b56ab54481896906a050c107ea1%2Felection2018-412.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"State Rep.

She also considers revamping the comptroller’s vendor payment program, which expedites overdue payments to state vendors through financial institutions that later collect the money from the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I anticipate that over the next few years, we are going to have to weather the storm of the Trump administration and essentially try to fill the holes where we can until we have a more sane federal government,” Croke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-2e0000\" name=\"image-2e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6b344a4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4944x2775+0+261/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F05%2F5a%2F66e27d344c7894c7a18347ab31a0%2Fsenateslating-071925-39.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b966f5d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4944x2775+0+261/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F05%2F5a%2F66e27d344c7894c7a18347ab31a0%2Fsenateslating-071925-39.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e0a5f60/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4944x2775+0+261/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F05%2F5a%2F66e27d344c7894c7a18347ab31a0%2Fsenateslating-071925-39.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"State Sen.

She and Kifowit have both floated the idea of reconsidering a graduated income tax — one of Pritzker’s first initiatives in office that voters rejected in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not running for comptroller because I love spreadsheets. I’m running because I believe and understand deeply that budgets are moral documents,” said Villa, 47, who is endorsed by Senate President Don Harmon, the Chicago Teachers Union, outgoing U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia and numerous  state lawmakers, unions and community-based organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I’ve been watching as we’ve had to cut services in order to balance budgets, to me, it has been gut-wrenching because those, to me, are children, seniors, working families, who are getting shoved basically to the back of the line,” Villa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state senator said she would prioritize distributing money for human services and public health, then for payrolls, schools and local governments, before other payments. Villa also emphasized her plan to implement a procurement accountability program that would ensure the state does not contract with vendors that are linked to federal immigration authorities like  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kifowit and Kim both outlined priorities to expand the comptroller office’s prevailing wage department, which ensures contractors on state-funded projects pay workers a wage comparable to the standard rates in the respective industry. All four candidates also stressed the need to continue the comptroller office’s project to modernize its computer systems and strengthen its cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;",

The Board of Review has &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/cook-county/2024/12/12/here-are-more-than-a-dozen-ways-cook-countys-property-tax-system-could-be-more-fair\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;openly feuded&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi over who’s to blame for the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, two of the three commissioners — Steele and George Cardenas, a veteran Chicago politician — are facing strong challengers in the March Democratic primary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele faces career Democratic operative Liz Nicholson, while Cardenas is opposed by Juanita Irizarry, a longtime community activist from the Humboldt Park neighborhood who once led the influential Friends of the Parks in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her first term in office, Steele gained the widest notoriety after she smashed a vehicle she was driving while allegedly drunk, and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2024/11/23/cook-county-politician-board-of-review-samantha-steele-chicago-police\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;defiantly told the cops&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “I’m an elected official,” according to the body-cam video recording of the incident. The case against Steele is pending in Cook County Circuit Court, but she’s fighting the charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in 2024, Steele &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2024/12/20/cook-county-board-of-review-samantha-steele-jon-snyder\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;fired an aide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after WBEZ reported that the employee had pleaded guilty in federal court and testified in a corruption trial in northwest Indiana against his brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the county paid &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/cook-county/2025/01/15/a-former-cook-county-agency-employee-will-get-180-000-in-a-legal-settlement\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;a $180,000 settlement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to another former Steele aide at the Board of Review who sued her, the agency and her chief of staff in a federal whistleblower lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicholson accused Steele of “horrific leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m the solution,” said Nicholson, a South Side native. “She's the problem, and calls a lot of undue attention to elected officials. It’s so bad.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenger said this was the right time for her to step forward after three decades as a top adviser to former Illinois Senate President John Cullerton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele, who lives in Evanston, is in her first term, having been elected in 2022 to represent the board district covering the North Side and northern suburbs. She said she was not surprised to encounter a strong backlash after she unseated an incumbent Board of Review commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm not surprised that the Democratic Party didn't endorse me because in Cook County politics, you know the saying is who brought you here, and nobody brought me there,” Steele said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said her frequent clashes with the other two board members — and ethics accusations from the county’s inspector general — distracted from a record of serving with technocratic skill, parlaying her experience in the tax appeals industry. Before moving to the Chicago area and running for office, Steele was the assessor of Indiana’s Tippecanoe County for one term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steele said she intends to fight the DUI charge in Cook County court aggressively but added, “I regret the whole thing. Absolutely. It just was not handled well, but I can't talk about it because it is still a pending legal matter, and once it's been resolved, I'm happy to discuss at great lengths with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But I can tell you that it has been very traumatic. I received death threats.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardenas has endorsed Nicholson. The former Chicago alderman — a Navy veteran who served five terms in the City Council — said Nicholson is “more mature” than Steele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't see eye-to-eye with Commissioner Steele, by any means,” Cardenas said. Cardenas has his own challenger with many powerful allies. Irizarry’s backers include U.S. Reps. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, Delia Ramirez and Danny Davis and nine Chicago City Council members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irizarry is best known for successfully opposing “Star Wars” creator George Lucas’ &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/chicago/2016/06/30/head-of-friends-of-the-park-its-on-mr-lucas\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;plan for a museum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; near the lakefront a decade ago. But she said she also has vast experience trying to stop rising property taxes and zoning changes in gentrified, historically Hispanic neighborhoods such as Wicker Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irizarry said Cardenas entered politics through the scandal-plagued political machine of then-Mayor Richard M. Daley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“George Cardenas himself came up in the Hispanic Democratic Organization, HDO, and has been very proximate to, if not directly involved in, a lot of scandals along the way,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Cardenas said he was proud to enjoy the endorsements of Democratic Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch and the county’s Democratic organization. Cardenas also said he had done much in office to help homeowners in minority communities fight property tax increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dan Mihalopoulos is a reporter for WBEZ.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Jesse Jackson had died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I got up, put my suit and my shirt and tie on, and I headed to their home,” Leak said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson died at 84, after a lengthy battle with progressive supranuclear palsy, a rare brain disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/obituaries/2026/02/17/rev-jesse-jackson-civil-rights-leader-rainbow-push-obituary\"   &gt;Rev.

He wanted Black Chicagoans to be able to bury their loved ones respectfully. The couple ran the business with their three sons, including the youngest &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2016/11/5/18373824/funeral-director-has-up-close-view-of-impact-of-chicago-violence\"   &gt;Spencer Leak&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It moved to its current Greater Grand Crossing location, 7838 S. Cottage Grove Ave., in 1959. Two other locations, in Country Club Hills and Matteson, have opened since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson moved with his family to Chicago in 1964 to attend seminary school. But they didn't have a place to live until &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/11/27/20986170/rev-clay-evans-civil-rights-leader-evangelical-broadcaster-gospel-icon-dies-obituary\"   &gt;Rev. Clay Evans&lt;/a&gt; introduced him to Andrew Leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My grandfather said, ‘Well, instead of finding them a place to live, they can just come and live with [us],'” Leak Jr. said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jacksons moved into the Leak family's three-flat in South Shore and stayed for years. It was the first place Jackson lived in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around that time, the funeral home had grown in prominence, holding services for many well-known Black Chicagoans. Soul singer Sam Cooke’s funeral in 1964 brought 200,000 mourners — a crowd size that damaged the funeral home's front doors, leaving broken glass. Other prominent burials include comedian Bernie Mac, rapper Juice WRLD and drug kingpin William Morris \"Flukey\" Stokes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-4d0000\" name=\"image-4d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/503a70c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7126x3999+0+465/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc3%2Faa%2F16a79410453f925fee6cfb47a038%2Fleak-260226-004a.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e9efa2d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7126x3999+0+465/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc3%2Faa%2F16a79410453f925fee6cfb47a038%2Fleak-260226-004a.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/93b4200/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7126x3999+0+465/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc3%2Faa%2F16a79410453f925fee6cfb47a038%2Fleak-260226-004a.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"A display case at Leak and Sons Funeral home features awards and memorabilia.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/93b4200/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7126x3999+0+465/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc3%2Faa%2F16a79410453f925fee6cfb47a038%2Fleak-260226-004a.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/12e287f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7126x3999+0+465/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc3%2Faa%2F16a79410453f925fee6cfb47a038%2Fleak-260226-004a.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/93b4200/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7126x3999+0+465/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc3%2Faa%2F16a79410453f925fee6cfb47a038%2Fleak-260226-004a.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A display case at Leak and Sons Funeral home features awards and memorabilia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the funeral home also became known as the place where no one would be turned away, no matter their financial status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Jackson went on to work with Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., staying close to the civil rights leader until his assassination in 1968. Jackson would later start what became the Rainbow PUSH Coalition in the 1970s, ran for president in the 1980s and then a decade later, traveled the world to free hostages, advise leaders and join picket lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Leak — who became friends with King and provided limousine services to him when he was in town — was also an advocate of social justice. In 1964, he led a march with Spencer Leak and 10,000 people that led to the desegregation of Oak Woods Cemetery on the South Side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The families stayed friends through it all, Leak Jr. said, who grew up playing basketball with Jackson’s sons. When Jesse Jackson Jr. first ran for Congress, Leak Jr. joined him on the campaign trail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The relationship just remained the same because of the funeral home and my grandfather and my father's work in the community and burying families for free and … supporting operation PUSH,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Andrew Leak died in 1993, Spencer Leak, now 88, took over as president and owner and renamed the business to Leak and Sons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leak Jr. became vice president at 23. Now at 56, he considers him and his father a “dynamic duo.” Leak Jr.’s siblings, mother and cousin are also involved in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are community-based, and we are known as the funeral home that will work with you. We don't turn anyone away, and we try to treat everyone the same,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Keeping it personal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the business has faced lawsuits claiming it had lost or mixed up bodies. In 2024, a family said Leak and Sons &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/small-business/2024/03/19/williams-leak-sons-funeral-home-wrong-body-lawsuit\"   &gt;dressed another corpse&lt;/a&gt; in their father’s clothing ahead of a viewing. In 2015, a family accused the business of losing their mother’s remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot moving parts [in this business], which is why we move slow,” Leak Jr. said. He declined to comment on the lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, seven bodies were burned in an embalming room fire that Leak Jr. said was likely electrical. He said business picked up after the fire. He estimates they do more than 2,500 burials annually, and they have 106 part- and full-time employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We like to say the setback was the setup for the comeback,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business still goes through hard times, though. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's always a struggle when you're running a Black-owned business, especially a funeral business where your business is not steady,” Leak Jr. said. “Sometimes we'll be busy. Sometimes we'll be twiddling our thumbs, but the bills still have to be paid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said what brings families back is the company's personal touch in every service. And he continues to answer calls from families while planning Jackson’s services, with the first starting &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/17/what-we-know-rev-jesse-jacksons-death-services\"   &gt;Thursday at Rainbow PUSH Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, 930 E. 50th St.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would never want this family to think, 'Well, he's not returning my call because they're handling Rev. Jackson,'” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On any given Saturday, the Leak family are dispersed at as many as 20 funerals across the Chicago area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we miss them at the church, we greet them at the cemetery,” he said. “And if we miss them at the cemetery and they're having a repass, we go and sit with them at the repass.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-710000\" name=\"image-710000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7f371a5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+272/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F04%2F07%2F284afffd46e894b1ec483902b321%2Fleak-260226-034.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b97b892/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+272/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F04%2F07%2F284afffd46e894b1ec483902b321%2Fleak-260226-034.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d9df4bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+272/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F04%2F07%2F284afffd46e894b1ec483902b321%2Fleak-260226-034.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Spencer Leak Jr. takes a phone call in his office.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d9df4bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+272/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F04%2F07%2F284afffd46e894b1ec483902b321%2Fleak-260226-034.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9d743dc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+272/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F04%2F07%2F284afffd46e894b1ec483902b321%2Fleak-260226-034.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d9df4bd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4598+0+272/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F04%2F07%2F284afffd46e894b1ec483902b321%2Fleak-260226-034.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spencer Leak Jr. takes a phone call in his office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘Just for him’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leak Jr. remembers his last visit with Jackson was last year, when he was hosting a Sunday radio program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Rev Jackson walked right in, and then he spoke on the radio show,\" Leak Jr. said. \"Everybody says that his body was shutting down but that mind was on fire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson didn’t have any directives on how his services should be held — at least none the Leak family were aware of. Within hours of his death, Jackson Jr. and Leak Jr. brought Jackson’s body to Leak and Sons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson Jr. wanted some private time with his father’s body, and Leak Jr. offered the room where Sam Cooke’s visitation was held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just like any other family that we serve, we want everything to be perfect,” he said. “Even with Rev. Jackson's iconic stature, it's not overwhelming. But I just want everything to go perfectly for him. … My main concern was to prepare him in a way that the family will be completely satisfied — that was my main concern. I don't care about our name being on a program. That's not me. You don't have to acknowledge us at the funeral.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leak Jr. has a road trip planned with Jackson on Saturday. He'll be driving the hearse to South Carolina, where Jackson is from, for services planned there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’ll be the first person to ride in this hearse,” Leak Jr. said. “I got it just for him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wanted to take on the responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm witnessing history here,” he said. “I'm playing a very small part in the history of a very large man, and it's just an honor to be doing this. And it was also like this when he was alive. It was just always an honor to be in his presence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago/2026/02/17/what-we-know-rev-jesse-jacksons-death-services\"   &gt;What we know about Rev.

Jesse Jackson — who died Feb. 17 at age 84 —&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;including scouting service locations in South Carolina and Washington and handling Jackson's remains.&amp;nbsp;But the death also hits close to home.&amp;nbsp;For decades, Spencer Leak Jr. said, his family and the Jacksons were \"intertwined.\" Leak’s grandfather, Andrew, welcomed Jackson and his family into his home, where they stayed upon first moving to Chicago in 1964.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Business history&lt;/b&gt;: Andrew Leak started the business in 1933 with a $500 loan from his wife, Dottie, and $500 that he saved from working as a bathroom attendant at the Chicago World’s Fair.&amp;nbsp;Leak wanted Black Chicagoans to be able to bury their loved ones respectfully. The couple ran the business with their three sons. The funeral home has handled services and burials for prominent Black figures including Sam Cooke,&amp;nbsp;Bernie Mac and Juice WRLD — and is known for not turning anyone away despite financial status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Civil rights legacy&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Jackson went on to work with Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.&amp;nbsp;Andrew Leak — who became friends with King and provided limousine services to him when he was in town — was also an advocate of social justice. In 1964, Leak led a march with his son Spencer Leak and 10,000 people that led to the desegregation of Oak Woods Cemetery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Services begin&lt;/b&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjthitk-l-d/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Jackson will lie in repose Thursday and Friday&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at Rainbow PUSH’s Kenwood headquarters.

Cappello spent three years as acting executive director before Johnson gave her the permanent job Feb. 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key context&lt;/b&gt;: Following the mayor's choice,&amp;nbsp;17 alderpersons signed a letter to Johnson at a City Council meeting demanding that he launch a national search for another director, citing concerns raised by advocates and volunteers at the city-run shelter, 2741 S. Western Ave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The concerns&lt;/b&gt;: Allegations range from high euthanasia rates and poor living conditions to three years of \"steadily increased\" dog bites that have jeopardized public safety. The alderpersons also claim police officers are often asked to cover animal care and control duties.&amp;nbsp;Cappello acknowledged that many of the 240 dogs at the shelter are only being walked once a week.

But inside, it’s warm, buzzing and full of families awaiting the start of an exclusive improv performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This show, a partnership between The Bit Theatre and Awesome Life Academy, is being staged for an audience of young adults with special needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Sometimes, when you’re in an audience and you bring somebody in, they might be too loud, or they might laugh inappropriately, or something like that,\" said Jennifer Monroy, an audience member and the mom of an Awesome Life participant. \"Here, these guys can just be themselves, be silly, and feel relaxed and just have fun.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activities like the improv show are an opportunity for Awesome Life participants to get out of the house, be social and make friends. The organization, based in Naperville, is a nonprofit serving young people with Down syndrome, autism and other special needs who have aged out of services from public schools. It also aims to provide participants with skills to help them find and maintain employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Basically, it’s all about activities which promote social interaction and life skills,\" said Monroy’s son, Clayton McGill, 28, who has been in the program for a little more than two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monroy said the experience \"has been amazing.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://newsletters.suntimes.com/t/t-l-wjthitk-l-ty/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;READ MORE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;PICTURE CHICAGO 📸&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-460000\" name=\"image-460000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e53ee88/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F5a%2F0b3d23eb4e27a520376428308702%2Fchicago-2602xx-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4208be1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F5a%2F0b3d23eb4e27a520376428308702%2Fchicago-2602xx-1.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7a86769/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F5a%2F0b3d23eb4e27a520376428308702%2Fchicago-2602xx-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Vehicles make their way east and westbound on the Eisenhower Expressway near the Cicero CTA train station, Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2026. | Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7a86769/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F5a%2F0b3d23eb4e27a520376428308702%2Fchicago-2602xx-1.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/da9988c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F5a%2F0b3d23eb4e27a520376428308702%2Fchicago-2602xx-1.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7a86769/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+158/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fce%2F5a%2F0b3d23eb4e27a520376428308702%2Fchicago-2602xx-1.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eisenhower Expressway is seen Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading the Sun-Times&amp;nbsp;Morning Edition!&lt;br&gt;Got a story you think we missed?&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:newsletters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Email us here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written and curated by&lt;/b&gt;: Matt Moore&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor&lt;/b&gt;: Eydie Cubarrubia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Chicago Sun-Times is a nonprofit supported by&amp;nbsp;readers like you.

That’s what defense attorney Matthew Madden told U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly when Schaefer’s arraignment got underway at the Dirksen Federal Courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge asked Schaefer if he would allow a defense attorney to represent him for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/heather-mack/2026/02/25/chicago-crime-heather-mack-tommy-schaefer-fbi-bali-indonesia\"   &gt;Tommy Schaefer arrested in Bali killing of Heather Mack’s mother after returning to Chicago&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Is there anything negative that would happen to me, judge, if I speak for myself?” Schaefer asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He then told the judge, “as far as, like, a matter like this, where my life is on the line, I’d rather speak for myself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then, Schaefer told the judge he’s “not really sure” how things go in federal court — and Kennelly told him that’s why he should let an attorney represent him. Schaefer wound up letting Madden&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;represent him for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to entering Schaefer’s plea, Madden told the judge that Schaefer would not fight detention, meaning he will remain in federal custody for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennelly set Schaefer’s trial for Jan. 11, 2027, at the end of an otherwise routine hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaefer wore an orange jumpsuit in court and walked with a limp. He initially sat down at a defense table but later stood before the judge. He didn’t appear to wear leg or arm shackles during the hearing, but officers placed him in handcuffs when it ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-cc0000\" name=\"image-cc0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9a847b3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/920x516+0+50/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2Faa%2Faf1c074c694132054f09d7b9030d%2Fmack083115-9mom.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e53a924/2147483647/strip/true/crop/920x516+0+50/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2Faa%2Faf1c074c694132054f09d7b9030d%2Fmack083115-9mom.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1a53fb8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/920x516+0+50/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2Faa%2Faf1c074c694132054f09d7b9030d%2Fmack083115-9mom.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Sheila von Wiese-Mack\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1a53fb8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/920x516+0+50/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2Faa%2Faf1c074c694132054f09d7b9030d%2Fmack083115-9mom.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/922a54d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/920x516+0+50/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2Faa%2Faf1c074c694132054f09d7b9030d%2Fmack083115-9mom.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1a53fb8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/920x516+0+50/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F77%2Faa%2Faf1c074c694132054f09d7b9030d%2Fmack083115-9mom.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheila von Wiese-Mack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun-Times Files&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaefer has known for at least four years that he’d face prosecution in Chicago’s federal court for his role in von Wiese-Mack’s murder. Mack, the mother of Schaefer’s nearly 11-year-old child, is already serving a 26-year sentence&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in the Federal Bureau of Prisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s in addition to seven years Mack spent imprisoned in Indonesia. Schaefer served more than 11 years there before being released and deported from the country this month, according to media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mack, now 30, likely has roughly 18 years to serve before she’ll be released in her late 40s. She returned to the United States&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in 2021 and later admitted to plotting her mother’s death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple is accused of planning von Wiese-Mack’s murder to access her $1.5 million estate. The killing triggered tabloid headlines around the world after her body was found stuffed in a suitcase outside the posh St. Regis Bali Resort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024/1/17/24039349/heather-mack-gets-26-years-in-federal-prison-for-the-murder-of-her-mother-in-bali\"   &gt;Heather Mack gets 26 years for murder of mom in Bali after stark testimony from family&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Authorities documented a long history of violence in the Mack home before the murder — how Mack allegedly bit her mother, shoved her to the ground so hard that von Wiese-Mack broke her arm, and at one point went around their home breaking plates and picture frames during an argument over household chores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mack broached the idea of killing her mother with Schaefer as early as February 2014, the feds say. Schaefer wrote in a Facebook chat that month, “that b---- heather is crazy” and added “she asked me to find someone to kill her mom for 50k.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feds say Mack ultimately enlisted Schaefer, secretly booking a $12,000 plane ticket for him so he could rendezvous with her while she vacationed with her mother in Bali in August 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, over the course of nearly 40 minutes on the morning of Aug. 12, 2014, prosecutors say Mack and Schaefer exchanged tense, excited text messages as they prepared to murder von Wiese-Mack. They allegedly used the phrase “saying hi” as code for the killing, and they referred to each other as Bonnie and Clyde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after, prosecutors say, von Wiese-Mack “was brutally beaten after being taken by surprise as she lay in her hotel bed.” Mack’s plea agreement alleged that Schaefer \"repeatedly beat von Wiese in the head and face,” ending her life.&lt;/p&gt;",

First, you learn new information, from the new people you talk to and the new stuff you see. Leaning new things is fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And second, you then can apply this new knowledge, making all sorts of interesting connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, struggling to articulate the general numbness of watching President Donald Trump's &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2026/02/24/president-donald-trump-state-of-the-union-speech-illinois-democrats-boycott\"   &gt;State of the Union address &lt;/a&gt;Tuesday, I remembered a cannulated cow seen at Chicago's High School for Agriculture Sciences in Mount Greenwood (What? You didn't know about either cannulated cows or the ag high school? Well, I'm happy to be the one to tell you.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MAGA types, who don't seem at all keen on either new people or new ideas, imagine liberals in some kind of pearl-clutching agony, or door-jamb-gnawing fury. But truly, nearly two hours of the State of the Union speech left me mostly bored. We've heard all this before, many times, from the moment candidate Trump descended that escalator in his monstrous brass and pink stone lobby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-ab0000\" name=\"module-ab0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Opinion bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best,\" he said. \"They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was more of the same. When he wasn't lying about the economy or gaslighting — for example,  declaring war on fraud — Trump was grinding over the threat of immigrants. Both criminals &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; bad drivers. That's where I thought of the cannulated cow. How cows digest their food is important to the dairy industry, and one way to keep tabs is to surgically implant a round window into the side of a cow.  Students and scientists look through the window, into the cow's stomach, and watch the half-digested mash sloshing around. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the State of the Union speech. The same well-chewed slop of fear, hatred, lies, prejudice, nationalism and enormous self-regard that Trump has been spewing for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the many dangers of this moment is exhaustion. The liars lie nonstop, while those familiar with the truth get tired of repeating ourselves, bloodying our fingers scratching at that brick wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet scratch we must. So forgive me for belaboring the obvious for the benefit of — well, I'm not sure who at this point. Either you understood long ago or you never will. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The current war on immigrants is not only morally and economically wrong, but entirely based on lies — haters are cowards, and rather than just admit they're surrendering to fear (of new people and new things) they slur the object of their fixation. They don't hate immigrants because immigrants are criminals; they tar them as criminals because they hate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, again: Immigrants commit less crime and have fewer traffic accidents than U.S.-born citizens. That makes sense: if you could be deported to some central American hell-hole for a speeding ticket, you'd drive slower too. But let's gild the lily and turn to research: a 2014 Purdue study crunching 24 years of immigration data found that as the population of illegal immigrants in a state increases, DUIs go down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Undocumented persons may be less likely to drive after drinking, or drive at all, because of fear of police surveillance and deportation,” the authors wrote in the American Journal of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying wash away the sour contents of the cesspool that the president spattered all over my carpet Tuesday, I remembered the Bad Bunny show two weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bad Bunny spoke to me. Well, sang, and not just to me. In Spanish, true, but I understood exactly what he was saying, about his home, Puerto Rico, his joyous, colorful world that includes old people, young people, a rainbow of colors and lifestyles, with joy and dancing. Some 128 million others watched.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or 100 million more than endured the president's spew. Only 28 million viewers endured the all-too-familiar speech, as if parking ourselves cross-legged before a front-loading washing machine filled with barf. A spectacle that managed to both sicken and bore at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strange that a halftime music show would offer more hope for the future of our country than a presidential address. Though never mistake hope for action. Those who do not want to spend the rest of our lives consuming enormous helpings of moral chunder are going to have to stay focused and work very hard to settle the nation's stomach. None of it will be fun or easy, and good people are going to continue to suffer and die. But better than the alternative, of mooing quietly while our nation sinks beneath the rising muck.&lt;/p&gt;",

Para la tarde, ella y otros tuvieron que correr a la calle para refugiarse en otro edificio mientras más bombas estallaban, incendiando una tienda de colchones cercana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estábamos refugiados en el lugar, no podíamos salir”, contó Menzie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-0d0000\" name=\"module-0d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ella estaba entre muchos habitantes de Chicago que visitaban ciudades mexicanas conmocionadas por la violencia del cártel durante el fin de semana y que ahora tienen esperanzas de regresar a casa a medida que se despejan los bloqueos en las carreteras y se reanudan las operaciones en los aeropuertos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los disturbios en el estado de Jalisco ocurrieron después de que el Ejército Mexicano matara al líder del Cártel Jalisco Nueva Generación (CJNG), Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, conocido como “El Mencho”, lo que llevó a al menos 48 horas de bloqueos e incertidumbre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos en las redes sociales mostraron el retorno del tráfico peatonal y vehicular en algunas ciudades y pueblos el martes, mientras los residentes evaluaban los daños y los turistas hacían planes para irse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menzie dijo que cientos de personas se habían puesto en contacto con ella para saber cómo estaba, aunque mencionó que se encontraba bien, salvo por el susto provocado por los helicópteros que sobrevolaban. Pero por otro lado, dijo haber visto mucha desinformación circulando en las redes sociales, lo que dificultaba discernir lo que realmente estaba sucediendo o encontrar información precisa sobre las órdenes de refugio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lo bueno de las redes sociales es que pudimos mantenernos en contacto”, contó Menzie. “Lo malo es que no podías escapar de ello, y parte de la información no era cierta”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos confirmó tarde el lunes que las carreteras cerradas debido a la violencia —o bloqueadas por coches incendiados por miembros del cártel— estaban reabriendo, salvo algunas entre Guadalajara y la ciudad turística de Puerto Vallarta. Funcionarios del gobierno también informaron que múltiples aerolíneas habían reanudado operaciones en los aeropuertos de Guadalajara y Puerto Vallarta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cinco vuelos a Chicago estaban entre los 100 cancelados desde Puerto Vallarta el domingo y el lunes después de que videos publicados en redes sociales mostraran el caos en los aeropuertos, según el sitio web de seguimiento FlightAware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Un vuelo de United Airlines de Puerto Vallarta salió el lunes por la tarde y aterrizó en Chicago por la noche. Un vocero de la aerolínea dijo que las operaciones completas se reanudaron en ese aeropuerto y en Guadalajara el lunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Airlines anunció que planeaba reanudar sus operaciones en ambos aeropuertos el martes con cuatro vuelos adicionales entre Puerto Vallarta y Estados Unidos, sumando 750 asientos extra. Un vuelo de American estaba programado directamente a Chicago el martes por la tarde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los viajeros de United y American podrían cambiar sus vuelos sin cargo para regresar a Estados Unidos, dijeron las aerolíneas. Los vuelos de AeroMéxico, VivaAerobus y Volaris dentro y fuera de Guadalajara, incluidos los vuelos hacia Estados Unidos, también estaban operando normalmente el martes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Departamento de Estado aún aconsejaba a los estadounidenses que buscaran refugio y minimizaran movimientos innecesarios, así como confirmar que los vuelos estaban listos para la salida antes de dirigirse al aeropuerto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El vuelo de Menzie está programado para salir el viernes, y con el aeropuerto abierto, dijo que no espera ningún problema. Caminó por las principales vías de la ciudad y fue a mercados el martes, y aunque se encontró con largas filas, mencionó que nunca hubo una sensación de peligro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estamos vigilando nuestros vuelos”, agregó Menzie. “Me sentí bastante segura hoy...

Flushing the successes is, in many ways, more challenging than turning the page after a tough season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson has been clear all offseason that the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/25/bears-nfl-scouting-combine-add-pass-rushers-edge-draft-trade-free-agency-maxx-crosby-zion-young-tj-parker\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Bears&lt;/a&gt; don’t get a head start on their 2026 journey just because they won the NFC North last year. Just three days after their season ended with an overtime loss to the Rams, Johnson declared his team was “back to the bottom again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He continued with that message at this week’s NFL Scouting Combine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve got to give more than what we gave a year ago – coaching staff, players, everyone in that building,” he said. “We have to do a little bit more. And so when you look at it that way, yeah, we are back to ground zero, and we’ve got to continue to build on this thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 20 of the past 23 NFL seasons, at least one team — including last year’s Bears — has won its division after finishing last in it the year before. For every team that jumps up, though, one has to fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears, who have posted consecutive 10-plus-win seasons just once since 1992, don’t have to look far for examples. The Lions and Vikings went a combined 29-5 in 2024. Last year, they went 18-16 and both missed the playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears’ first step in trying to avoid the same fate is to acknowledge the challenge out loud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The moment you get comfortable and think you can take success from one year and just apply it to the next, you can be in for a rude awakening,” general manager Ryan Poles said. “The mindset that we have to have is starting fresh, rebuilding the foundation that we had, and then improving where we need to improve, specifically where our struggles are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we have that mindset, we'll be good. If the mindset is, we'll be good just because we were good last year, I think you're setting yourself up for failure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears know they need to fix via the draft, trades and free agency —&amp;nbsp;and it’s mostly on defense. They need an improved pass rush from the edge and tackle spots. With Tremaine Edmunds on his way out, they must find at least one starting linebacker. They want Kevin Byard back, but currently have two starting safety vacancies. If Nahshon Wright leaves via free agency, the Bears will likely eye adding an outside cornerback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On offense, the Bears have a vacancy to fill at left tackle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson has been more active in the Bears’ offseason planning than he was last February, when he was busy assembling a coaching staff. He attends draft meetings and, along with defensive coordinator Dennis Allen and other assistants, communicates to Poles exactly the types of players he’s looking for.That includes body type and skillset preferences, but also mental makeup and the prospects they fit into the Bears’ playing style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more that we talk and go through, or watch guys and have conversations about our own guys, the more clarity we get from what they want,” Poles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are obvious advantages to Johnson being in his second year. Quarterback Caleb Williams and his teammates don’t need to learn a new playbook. Defensive players know what Allen expects. The standards that Johnson so carefully built last season, off the field and on, are established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that sense, the Bears aren’t back at square one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In so many other ways, they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It does help frame our mindset,” Johnson said, “that we are going to have to give more.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Al Sharpton were in attendance on Thursday to pay their respects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We spent a lifetime together,\" said Sharpton outside the Rainbow PUSH headquarters. \"He raised a generation of us and he never gave up, even when he was sick.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What hotels are recommended for those traveling to Chicago for the events?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those traveling to Chicago to attend services are encouraged to stay at the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place Chicago at 2233 S. Martin Luther King Drive, according to the family's website. Rooms at the hotel have been reserved within a hotel block, with limited availability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where can people park?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those hoping to attend the Jackson lying in state events, street parking is available at Rainbow PUSH on South Drexel Boulevard, East 49th Street, East Hyde Park Boulevard and East 49th Street. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the People's Celebration, parking will be available at House of Hope's parking lot on 113th Street. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What security measures will be in place?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At each event, security checks and magnetometers will be in place. The family's website asks that individuals limit items brought to smooth the process.  Weapons, signs and any items that could disrupt services are prohibited&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on the scheduled services visit &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.jessejacksonlegacy.com/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;jessejacksonlegacy.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where will the Rev. Jesse Jackson be buried?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson will be buried at &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/curious-city/2025/06/04/prejudice-follows-us-to-the-grave-the-segregated-past-of-chicago-cemeteries#:~:text=Mayor%20Harold%20Washington%20is%20buried,bring%20it%20to%20an%20end.\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Oak Woods Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, the largest cemetery on the South Side, in Greater Grand Crossing. Former Chicago Mayor Harold Washington, journalist and civil rights activist Ida B. Wells and Olympic athlete Jesse Owens are among those buried there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How did he die?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While his family has not given an official cause of death nor said where he died, Jackson had been declining in health for a decade before his death. In 2015,&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2017/11/17/18375473/rev-jesse-jackson-announces-parkinson-s-diagnosis\"   &gt; Jackson was initially diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, but he revealed last April that he actually had progressive supranuclear palsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How is the political world reacting to his death?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political figures from across the country have weighed in to pay their respects and honor his legacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a joint statement, former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama wrote: \"Michelle and I will always be grateful for Jesse's lifetime of service, and the friendship our families share. We stood on his shoulders. We send our deepest condolences to the Jackson family and everyone in Chicago and beyond who knew and loved him.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump also extended his sympathies to Jackson's family in a statement posted to Truth Social last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I knew him well, long before becoming President,\" he said. \"He was very gregarious — Someone who truly loved people! Despite the fact that I am falsely and consistently called a Racist by the Scoundrels and Lunatics on the Radical Left, Democrats ALL, it was always my pleasure to help Jesse along the way.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago leaders, including Mayor Brandon Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker, also shared their condolences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"In honor of Rev. Jackson's service, and as our city mourns, the Chicago flag will lower to half-staff,\" Mayor Johnson wrote in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pritzker also ordered all flags across the state to fly at half-mast to honor him in a statement posted on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He broke down barriers, inspired generations, and kept hope alive. Our state, nation, and world are better due to his years of service,\" Pritzker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How are Chicagoans reacting to his death?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the city, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2026/02/17/jesse-jackson-chicago-remembers\"   &gt;Chicago residents mourned Jackson’s death&lt;/a&gt; and urged that his legacy continue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Travis, a congregant of Apostolic Church of God in Woodlawn, said in his youth, his parents brought him to demonstrations organized by Operation Breadbasket, a movement Jackson led. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, 64, Travis remembers Jackson as \"instrumental in fighting for justice and freedom for all people.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chloe Gould, 41, a Bronzeville resident, said that his death hit \"like you lost a family member.\" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of his death, she said she worries about the future of civil rights activism, as other activists and leaders have not stepped in to fill his shoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Who is gonna be the civil rights activist now?\" she asked. &lt;/p&gt;",

Students like Geovani Jaimes, Arichely Mendina and Emilio Zurita worry about finding new schools midyear, and whether they'll get the support they need to transfer credits and carry over college plans.\" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/93b6a70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6122x4083+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F7d%2F0a%2Ff9e5fa324f08bbf21efacc3b52b6%2Faspiraclosing-260227-28.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;Chicago Public Schools officials told leaders of the ASPIRA charter school network Wednesday night that the district is transferring students out of their two high schools for the remainder of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an unprecedented move by the school district that will disrupt the education of some 545 students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS officials told the financially distressed charter network that it was taking this action to “safeguard students’ educational stability” and to make sure it’s complying with state and federal laws. ASPIRA has been relying on cash advances from CPS to make payroll, but the state limits how much CPS can do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To be clear, CPS is not revoking ASPIRA’s charter at this time, but is moving forward with a student transition process as oversight, due to the emergency situation created by ASPIRA’s failure to demonstrate financial sustainability, which places the education of ASPIRA’s students at risk,” CPS told ASPIRA’s board president David Rodriguez and other ASPIRA board members in a letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seniors from ASPIRA’s two high schools will be at the CPS board meeting Thursday to try to convince members to change their minds. Just last month, some board members said they were reluctant to keep giving ASPIRA cash advances, even as they sympathize with how this decision impacts students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen-year-old Angeline Melody Solis said she wants the board to keep that top of mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don't control the money and where the money goes so it really sucks that at the end of the day, we face the most consequences,” she told WBEZ in an interview Wednesday. “The students have so many concerns about college and their credits. There's just so many things that should have been taken into account, besides the money.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS officials made this decision after they gave ASPIRA a Tuesday deadline to find outside funding to make it through the school year and to submit a financial plan for the future. ASPIRA responded by saying it was trying to get a bridge loan and would fundraise, according to documents provided to WBEZ by CPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASPIRA leaders also demanded that CPS give the charter network four years of retroactive funding to make up for what ASPIRA’s leaders believe is a chronic underfunding of all charter schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS officials rejected this, saying there is no way to give back funding once the budget for past years is closed. They also said that ASPIRA’s response to CPS’ demands were insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The back-and-forth between ASPRIA and CPS has been going on for months, with both sides blaming each other for the network’s financial problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPS contracts with private organizations to run charter schools and, at the recommendation of CPS leaders, board members renewed ASPIRA’s contract in April 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it did with many recent charter renewals, CPS gave ASPIRA a shorter two-year contract and imposed several conditions, including that it participate in a “financial remediation” program that requires the network to submit monthly cash flow statements so the district can conduct additional oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the charter network had financial struggles throughout the school year. In November, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2025/11/19/chicago-public-schools-aspira-charter-network-finances-cps-investigation\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;WBEZ and the Sun-Times previously reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CPS sent ASPIRA a letter after a months-long investigation blasting the charter network’s leadership for “a failure of governance” and “a lack of financial proficiency necessary to successfully run a school.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASPIRA’s executive director Edgar Lopez responded that the charter school network did not have enough money to make payroll through the end of the school year. He said the charter network needed $4.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2025/11/25/cps-to-help-aspira-make-payroll-but-charter-operators-financial-woes-remain\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;CPS has given ASPIRA $2.25 million in cash advances&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “to support payroll and continuity of student services,” according to CPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, when Lopez announced last month that he needed even more to get through the school year, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2026/02/11/cps-charter-school-cant-make-payroll-insolvent-closed-march-aspira-chiarts-cpsboard\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;board members pushed back&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it would be against the law to continue sending the charter network extra funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State law requires school districts to give charters between 97% and 103% of what they provide for district-run schools. CPS would be over that limit if it kept advancing ASPIRA money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Board members also said they worried about the precedent they were setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just the last two years, four private organizations with contracts to run public schools in Chicago have said they no longer want to operate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charter schools’ budgets are closely tied to student enrollment and, with an overall &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/09/25/chicago-public-schools-enrollment-drops-restarts-decrease-migrant-students-latino-immigration\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;decline in the CPS student population&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, charters are having trouble filling their seats. ASPIRA has the CPS permission to admit up to 1,600 students at its two high schools, but this year started out with less than 600. Charter school operators also cite other issues that have added to their financial troubles, including rising labor costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Board members are &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2025/11/04/cps-chiarts-epic-academy\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;taking over management&lt;/a&gt; of the Chicago High School for the Arts and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.wbez.org/education/2024/12/21/cps-votes-to-spare-7-acero-charter-schools-from-closure-plans-to-absorb-5-in-2026\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;five schools run by the Acero School&lt;/a&gt;s charter network. But CPS is letting two other Acero schools and a small Southeast Side charter school called EPIC close.&lt;/p&gt;",

While players and team owners hash it out, the Sun-Times analyzes the moving parts ahead of the Sky’s 2026 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Will the season start on time?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The schedule says “play ball” on May 8, with the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Sky&lt;/a&gt; set to open in Portland on May 9. But will they?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond CBA negotiations, the league still needs to run two expansion drafts, the college draft and a massive free agency period. It now says that if a deal isn’t reached by March 10, the season won’t begin on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sticking point: a $58 million gap between the two sides’ salary cap proposals. The league claims the players’ proposal would lead to “hundreds of millions of dollars” in losses over the life of the agreement, while the players say it would leave the league in a “profitable position.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody can validate any of that, because league financials and projections aren’t public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, both sides insist they’re trying to avoid a strike or lockout, and say they want a season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. What will the Sky roster look like?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;While nothing is set in stone, fans can reasonably expect to see Angel Reese, Kamilla Cardoso, Ajša Sivka, and Courtney Vandersloot in a Sky uniform this season. Vandersloot is a free agent and franchise great who plans to return, and Reese, Cardoso, and Sivka are young building blocks under contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make this crew competitive, the Sky will need some wins in free agency. The biggest unknown on that front is Ariel Atkins. The Sky traded for the two-time All-Star last season hoping she’d become part of the core, but she hasn’t indicated whether she plans to return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be plenty of opportunities to take big swings elsewhere, with more than 100 veteran free agents available. Coming off two losing seasons, though, Chicago will be a tough sell for the biggest names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sky also have Hailey Van Lith and Maddy Westbeld under contract, but one will likely be left unprotected in the expansion draft. (Expansion teams Portland Fire and Toronto Tempo will each be able to pluck one “unprotected” player from every team.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Lith is &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2025/12/18/sky-point-guard-hailey-van-lith-enters-a-defining-offseason\"   &gt;most likely to be protected&lt;/a&gt; given where the Sky drafted her in 2025 (No. 11). She’s been rehabbing an ankle injury, and the goal is for her to be ready by the start of the season, per a team source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Who is Sivka and why haven’t I heard of her?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sivka was the Sky’s top pick in the 2025 draft (No. 10), but the 20-year old has been playing overseas. A 6’3 sharpshooting wing, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2025/11/28/setting-expectations-for-20-year-old-sky-prospect-ajsa-sivka\"   &gt;the Sky love her mobility and quick release&lt;/a&gt;. She’s shooting 36.4% from three on 4.7 attempts per game for her Spanish club.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General manager Jeff Pagliocca told the Sun-Times he expects Sivka to report for the Sky’s 2026 season and play heavy minutes right away. Sivka’s agent did respond in time to a request for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. What’s the latest with Reese?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last season raised real doubts about &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2025/09/11/after-another-losing-season-reese-sky-rift-clouds-future\"   &gt;Reese’s long-term future in Chicago&lt;/a&gt;. Given her talents as a generational rebounder and budding playmaker, she looked to be the face of the franchise for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That feels less certain now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As another losing season came to a close, Reese’s tone toward the organization changed. She alluded to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2025/08/19/angel-reese-alludes-to-tension-regarding-her-recovery-from-back-injury\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;disappointment with how her back injury was handled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and questioned the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2025/08/21/playoffs-dream-dead-foundation-under-review-for-sky\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;organization’s progress&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She told the Tribune that though she’d like to be in Chicago long-term, if “things don’t pan out” she might have to “move in a different direction and do what’s best for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sky ownership &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2025/09/07/whose-idea-was-it-to-suspend-angel-reese\"   &gt;suspended her&lt;/a&gt; over other comments made in that interview, namely demanding a better roster and questioning the wisdom of relying on 37-year-old point guard Courtney Vandersloot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, no major flare-ups have occurred. Reese &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2025/12/12/from-usa-basketball-camp-sky-star-angel-reese-quiets-fears-about-a-departure-from-chicago\"   &gt;has not requested a trade&lt;/a&gt; and the Sky expect her back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, neither side has publicly signaled that the relationship has been repaired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are Reese and the Sky still committed to each other for the long haul? Or are they just biding their time until her rookie contract ends after the 2027 season — or until the right trade partner comes along?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Where will the Sky practice?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;At some point during the 2026 season, the Sky will practice &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2026/02/06/skys-new-practice-facility-will-be-ready-by-late-spring-ceo-adam-fox-says\"   &gt;in their new facility in Bedford Park&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2026/02/13/in-the-wnba-facilities-race-sky-hold-a-momentary-advantage\"   &gt;only two new practice facilities opening this season&lt;/a&gt; and will be among the largest in the league.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sky just released a list of features through the Sports Business Journal including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" style=\"margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-inline-start:48px;\" id=\"rte-ff095fd1-134d-11f1-a547-37f7705b3b3e\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Two full-size basketball courts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight room&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance and recovery areas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kitchen with a full-time chef&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hot and cold tubs, sauna, infrared room, massage room&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Players’ lounge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On-site doctor’s office&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mother’s and family room&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Content creation studio and glam stations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Secure parking lot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt; the building will be available, the Sky’s official projection is “late spring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Brady, the mayor of Bedford Park, told the Sun-Times that much depends on the weather. He thinks there’s a “good chance” that the Sky will be able to use their locker room and weight room by May 1 and expects the courts to be ready by June. In the meantime, the Sky can practice in the attached Wintrust Sports Complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which means a delayed start to the season may not be the worst thing for the Sky. More time to finish construction and show free agents what's coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Who will the Sky select at No. 5 in the 2026 college draft?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;LSU’s Flau’jae Johnson and UCLA’s Kiki Rice appeared at No. 5 in recent mock drafts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are reasonable picks for a team that just needs to add good players. Johnson is one of the most talented guards in her draft class, and while Rice may not have the same star ceiling, she has an explosiveness the Sky need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a wrinkle with Johnson. She and Reese won the national championship together in 2023 at LSU, but since then both have indicated they aren’t friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean they can’t hoop together. But if the Sky are still committed to building around Reese, it’s a dynamic worth weighing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-sky/2026/02/01/ucla-womens-team-has-something-bruin\"   &gt;keep an eye on UCLA’s loaded roster&lt;/a&gt;. Lauren Betts, Gabriela Jaquez, and Gianna Kneepkens could all fit for the Sky.&lt;/p&gt;",

That was the motivation, and it turned out to be a very special one as well.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Ducks rallied to beat two-time defending conference champion Edmonton in their return from the Olympic break, overcoming a pair of two-goal deficits and another one-goal deficit during their frenetic four-goal third period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutter Gauthier scored the winner with 1:14 to play, and Anaheim hung on for its NHL-leading eighth multigoal comeback win during its first year under Quenneville, whose players all gathered at the bench to mob their coach after the whistle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It was an important game for us in a lot of ways,\" said Quenneville, who has the second-place Ducks in the Stanley Cup playoff race for the first time since 2018. \"They had the puck a lot more than we did, but at the same time, I thought we found a way to win a game. It had other meanings, but to me it was the importance of where it put us in the standings, and coming out of the break, the momentum that we could get off a win like tonight.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 67-year-old Quenneville received some fine bottles of wine and cigars among his postgame gifts, but he planned to celebrate just with a beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second member of the 1,000-win club took a long time to join Bowman, who got his 1,000th with the Detroit Red Wings on Feb. 8, 1997 — just a month after Quenneville coached his very first game with the St. Louis Blues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quenneville reached the mark in his 1,825th game of a career highlighted by three Stanley Cup championships with the Blackhawks. Bowman finished his career in 2002 with 1,244 victories in 2,141 regular-season games, also winning nine Stanley Cup titles as a coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2025/10/19/joel-quenneville-blackhawks-moved-on-ducks-return-chicago-sexual-assault\"   &gt;Joel Quenneville, Blackhawks have ‘moved on’ from each other, and his quiet return Sunday proved it&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2021/10/27/22749753/kyle-beach-blackhawks-sexual-assault-victim-name-bradley-aldrich-joel-quenneville-donald-fehr\"   &gt;Kyle Beach reveals he’s Blackhawks’ sexual-assault victim: ‘The healing process is just beginning’&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2025/05/08/joel-quenneville-former-blackhawks-coach-hired-by-anaheim-ducks\"   &gt;Former Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville hired by Ducks&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2021/10/28/22751588/joel-quenneville-resigns-panthers-blackhawks-coach-sexual-assault-kyle-beach-brad-aldrich\"   &gt;Joel Quenneville out as Panthers coach in aftermath of Blackhawks investigation&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\"He's from a different league when I look at his company,\" Quenneville said about Bowman, who was a senior adviser of hockey operations to his son, general manager Stan Bowman, during the Blackhawks' successful run under Quenneville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I think he's lonesome up there, the number he's at,\" Quenneville added. \"I had Scotty and Stan in Chicago together. We had some great wins, and he's got a lot of Cups. He's been very successful in the game. ... I'm happy to be getting the opportunity back in the game and be around a team like we've got now.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quenneville has made a successful return to the NHL this season in Anaheim after a four-year absence from the league following his &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2021/10/28/22751588/joel-quenneville-resigns-panthers-blackhawks-coach-sexual-assault-kyle-beach-brad-aldrich\"   &gt;resignation from the Florida Panthers&lt;/a&gt; in late 2021 over his inaction during the Blackhawks' sexual abuse scandal 11 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quenneville's &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2024/07/01/blackhawks-sexual-assault-stan-bowman-joel-qunneville-nhl-reinstated\"   &gt;NHL ban was lifted&lt;/a&gt; in July 2024, and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2025/05/08/joel-quenneville-former-blackhawks-coach-hired-by-anaheim-ducks\"   &gt;the Ducks hired him&lt;/a&gt; one year later to take over a struggling franchise with no playoff appearances in seven consecutive seasons. Anaheim (31-23-3) has vaulted into the thick of the Western Conference playoff race in its first season under Quenneville, who has led his teams to the playoffs in 20 of the 22 NHL seasons he finished behind a bench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if there were times when he wondered whether he would have a chance to reach 1,000 wins, Quenneville replied: \"It's something that I don't think about. I think my motivation, my goals were always once you win a Cup one time, you can't wait to do it again. It's always been the reason why we're doing what we're doing.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After playing 13 NHL seasons as a sturdy defenseman with the signature bristly mustache he has sported for his entire adult life, Quenneville has been an NHL head coach for parts of 26 seasons, and he has won at every stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He led the Blues to seven consecutive playoff appearances before his firing. Quenneville then lasted just three seasons in Colorado despite producing two playoff teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He replaced Denis Savard behind the Blackhawks' bench in 2008 and led the Original Six franchise to eight straight playoff appearances and three championships — including the 2010 Stanley Cup, which ended the NHL's longest active drought at 59 seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quenneville joined the Panthers in April 2019, but his third season in Florida ended abruptly when the NHL banned him along with Stan Bowman and Al MacIsaac \"as a result of their inadequate response upon being informed in 2010 of allegations that &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2021/10/27/22749753/kyle-beach-blackhawks-sexual-assault-victim-name-bradley-aldrich-joel-quenneville-donald-fehr\"   &gt;Blackhawks player Kyle Beach&lt;/a&gt; had been assaulted by the club's video coach,\" the league said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman determined Quenneville had showed remorse for his inaction on the allegations that surfaced during Chicago's playoff run to a Stanley Cup title. Quenneville said he also worked with advocacy groups to study the proper ways to lead in such situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quenneville remained intently focused on the NHL during his four years away from the bench, watching games every night on television from his home in Florida and staying in contact with his countless friends in the game. Those friends included Pat Verbeek, his former teammate with the Hartford Whalers and the Ducks' general manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verbeek fired Greg Cronin and persuaded owner Henry Samueli to take the potential risk and the definite public-relations hit of hiring Quenneville. The move has worked out splendidly on the ice so far, with the Ducks dramatically improving their record with a talented young core gaining another year of experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowman and Quenneville could be joined in the 1,000-win club by two more veteran coaches within the next few seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Maurice, who won the past two Stanley Cup titles with the Panthers, has 945 career victories with five teams. Lindy Ruff earned his 933rd career victory Wednesday night with the Buffalo Sabres' 2-1 win over New Jersey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

A trade would allow him to fulfill his dream this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked Wednesday what he personally wants to see happen before the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/02/21/blackhawks-nhl-trade-deadline-preview-connor-murphy-jason-dickinson-ilya-mikheyev\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;trade deadline&lt;/a&gt; next Friday (March 6), he answered honestly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I don’t know,\" Murphy said. \"I would like to be here. I would like to also play in the playoffs. It’s kind of mixed emotion. That’s why this time is so hard, having that feeling tearing you both ways. It’s not an easy answer either way.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout 12-plus NHL seasons, Murphy has never played in a playoff game attended by fans. His only berth came in the 2020 COVID bubble in Edmonton, which hardly resembled a real postseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His contract, which carries a $4.4 million salary-cap hit, technically allows him only to submit a 10-team no-trade list, but the Hawks will make sure to do right by their longest-tenured player and longtime alternate captain in any trade that materializes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And doing right by him likely means sending him to a team that's a strong bet to make the playoffs —&amp;nbsp;with decent odds of making a deep run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It’s an odd thing, the potential to get traded to a team that’s in that spot,\" he said. \"I’ve been so focused for nine years on wanting to make the playoffs here, and wanting to play our best and grow as a team...be a better leader and teammate to help push it along. It’s a funny situation. It’s just interesting how the business side can change and pull you to a different direction.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/01/28/blackhawks-connor-murphy-reflects-on-tenure-chicago-home-patience\"   &gt;As Connor Murphy’s Blackhawks tenure nears its end, he still dreams about rewarding Chicago for its patience&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Veteran right-handed defensemen are desirable at the deadline every year, and this year is no different. No contending team ever believes they have enough depth in that category. The Stars, Red Wings and Sabres stand out as three probable playoff teams with the strongest need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no shortage of veteran right-handed defensemen available on the market, though. Besides Murphy, the list also includes Tyler Myers (Canucks), Dougie Hamilton (Devils), Justin Faulk (Blues), Luke Schenn (Jets) and Rasmus Ristolainen (Flyers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second-round pick would represent a solid return for Murphy, but Hawks general manager Kyle Davidson might have to maneuver the market cleverly to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Hawks players and coaches have taken the past week to discuss and recognize Murphy's immense &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/01/28/blackhawks-connor-murphy-reflects-on-tenure-chicago-home-patience\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;impact on Chicago&lt;/a&gt; and on the organization, suggesting they all believe a trade is coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murphy sounds like a man who expects to live elsewhere two weeks from now, too. He has told his wife, Kristina, a Chicago native, to be prepared to move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"[Connor has] played really well,\" coach Jeff Blashill said. \"There was a time, earlier in the year, where he wasn't given lots of minutes. He's really done a good job earning ice time on a consistent basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"He's a huge reason why our [penalty] kill has been really successful. He's defended really well; he's moved the puck well. He's shown some scoring. He's been physical. He's fought. All those things are an important part of leadership.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Murphy must squash his drifting thoughts and focus on the hockey at hand:&amp;nbsp;his likely final road trip in a red sweater. He's expected to be in the lineup Thursday against the Predators, and the Hawks have three more games after that before the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"[I'm] just focusing on trying to get your body and mind into game-play again,\" Murphy said. \"Because no matter what happens, you want to be playing your best and feeling your best.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\"

Gov. Mike Braun must now sign it into law, which is expected. The bill passed 45-4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that’s left is for the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears-stadium\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Bears&lt;/a&gt; to decide between Hammond and Arlington Heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We sure give the Bears a lot to think about to come here,” state senator Rick Niemeyer said. “I think it’s very serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Niemeyer, from Lowell, acknowledged that the Bears have flirted with moving to Indiana off and on over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a little different this time,” he said. “I think it’s very serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears-stadium/2026/02/26/chicago-bears-property-tax-incentives-illinois-house-city-opposition-arlington-heights-proposed-stadium\"   &gt;Chicago Bears property tax incentives advance in Illinois House over city opposition&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sen. Ron Alting, an avowed Colts fan, was quick to say he wore No. 51 from seventh grade through high school because he admired star Dick Butkus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was my man,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senate Bill 27 empowers the NISA to acquire and finance a Bears stadium. It also would be tasked with construction, equipping, operating and maintenance of the proposed domed stadium near Wolf Lake in Hammond. The bill would draw financing from Lake County and Porter County food and beverage tax and the Lake County inkeeper’s tax. Hammond would also impose an admissions tax and the state would renegotiate toll road fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State senator Ryan Mishler, who authored the bill, said the Bears could break ground in spring 2027, though there might be work done to the site this year. He praised Bears officials, saying it was a “privilege to work with those folks and learn more about their families.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State senator Lonnie Randolph, who represents Hammond, Munster, East Chicago, Whiting and parts of Highland, praised the potential “enormous” economic impact of a stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This Bears thing is a major historical event,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears have said they would pay $2 billion to build a stadium, be it in Hammond or Arlington Heights. The team owns the 326 acres at the former Arlington International Racecourse but is wants to pay lower property taxes. The Bears would keep any proceeds from naming rights of either stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just steps from the NFL Scouting Combine, the Indiana House of Representatives passed the bill by a 95-4 vote on Tuesday. The state’s legislative session ends Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bears chairman George McCaskey and president Kevin Warren made their usual trip to the NFL Scouting Combine but were not present during the votes Tuesday or Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, general manager Ryan Poles smiled when asked whether he had paid attention to the Bears’ dance with Arlington Heights and Hammond. Poles was swimming in a hotel pool in Grand Cayman a few weeks ago when Bears fans started telling him where they wanted the stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve got a lot of faith in Kevin and George to get that done and do what's best for our organization, our fan base,” he said. “There's a lot of pieces involved with that. But like I said, I've got enough to worry about with the roster.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last 22 months, the Bears have declared three separate sites as the only location that worked for them — first a Lakefront plot south of Soldier Field, then Arlington Heights and then, earlier this month, Hammond. The Bears first turned their attention to Indiana when Warren sent a letter to season ticket-holders in December saying the team had been told by Illinois lawmakers that “our project will not be a priority in 2026.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday, the&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears-stadium/2026/02/26/chicago-bears-property-tax-incentives-illinois-house-city-opposition-arlington-heights-proposed-stadium\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt; Illinois Finance and Revenue Committee &lt;/a&gt;passed the so-called mega-project bill to allow the Bears to negotiate property taxes, sending it to the House floor.&lt;/p&gt;",

Kam Buckner (D-Chicago), would allow the NFL team to negotiate a freeze on property tax assessments with local taxing districts — in this case, Arlington Heights, Cook County and local school districts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This marks the latest development in the high-stakes bidding war between Illinois and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears-stadium/2026/02/19/chicago-bears-stadium-hammond-indiana-move\"   &gt;Indiana&lt;/a&gt; over which state can lay claim to one of the NFL’s most storied franchises as the team looks for the exits from its long-time lease at Soldier Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a roll call opposed by Republicans, the Democratic-led House Revenue &amp;amp; Finance Committee voted 13-7 to back Buckner’s legislation and position it for a vote by the full House. But that didn't happen after the committee vote because the House adjourned for the week without taking action on the measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the committee's action, Buckner said it’s time to start putting a legislative plan into motion, and the property tax concessions are essential for anything going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don't feel pressured by the Bears,” Buckner said. “What is important to me, though, is that we are able to put these tools in play. I do want the team to stay in Illinois. That's very important to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill that advanced Thursday deals only with the issue of property tax certainty and saving the Bears hundreds of millions of dollars by freezing property taxes on the Arlington International Racecourse site, and allowing the team to negotiate reduced “payments in lieu of property taxes with suburban school districts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still to be determined is the massive infusion of infrastructure funding required to bankroll the road, sewer and utility work needed to ready the site for development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the vote, Buckner appeared on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/fran-spielman-show\"   &gt;“The Fran Spielman Show”&lt;/a&gt; podcast and said the infrastructure wish list that started at $855 million has been whittled down to $734 million and said, “We’re still talking through it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Buckner told the Chicago Sun-Times  that whatever the final number turns out to be, the Chicago legislative delegation will demand similar help to renovate and refresh Soldier Field and ease the transportation bottleneck that makes it difficult to get in and out of the Museum Campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve still got some things to work on, including Chicago and what happens with Chicago and a Chicago package,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckner, whose district includes Soldier Field, has long spoken out against the state cutting a blank check to finance a new Bears’ stadium, particularly given that roughly half a billion dollars in debt remains from the 2003 renovation of Soldier Field. Buckner said the Bears should pick up that tab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Park District has made an ask for &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears-stadium/2026/02/24/soldier-field-renovation-post-chicago-bears-era-illinois-general-assembly\"   &gt;$630 million&lt;/a&gt; for infrastructure and renovation of the Soldier Field — an appeal that a representative of the mayor’s office renewed today despite formally registering as an opponent to Buckner’s legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Mahr, Chicago’s acting chief financial officer, told the House panel the relocation of the Bears would have “devastating consequences on the city,” and he re-upped the city’s previous $630 million infrastructure request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some of those consequences are unknowable,” Mahr said. “It is clear that Chicago is the economic engine of the state of Illinois. Engines require fuel to run, otherwise engines stall and grind to a halt. The city is requesting a fair and equitable opportunity and a level playing field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labor unions, business groups and several northwest suburbs, including Arlington Heights, voiced support for the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a developing story.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Practicamos en la cancha de baloncesto, y tenemos que enrollar los tapices al final de cada práctica”, dijo Townsell, director ejecutivo de Lawndale Christian Development Corp. “Tenemos una instalación vieja, y ese es el caso para muchos atletas de las Escuelas Públicas de Chicago. No tienen una instalación permanente”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pero eso pronto cambiará para muchos estudiantes y jóvenes en el lado oeste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Fundación Lohengrin, con sede en Chicago, anunció el miércoles que Lawndale Christian Development y Erie Neighborhood House recibirán $10 millones y $5 millones, respectivamente, para la construcción de dos nuevos centros comunitarios y juveniles en el lado oeste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El premio proviene de la iniciativa “Thriving Youth, Stronger Communities”, que se lanzó en 2024 para ayudar a crear entornos donde los jóvenes de Chicago puedan crecer y prosperar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawndale Christian Development y Erie Neighborhood House son los primeros en recibir el premio, dijo Mark Rodríguez, director ejecutivo de la Fundación Lohengrin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Los $10 millones apoyarán el proyecto de Lawndale Christian Development, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/real-estate/2025/11/20/plan-commission-approves-depaul-practice-facility-morgan-park-commons\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;One Lawndale&lt;/a&gt;, que fue aprobado por el Concejo Municipal a finales de 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El premio “hace posible [One Lawndale]”, dijo Richard Townsell, director ejecutivo de Lawndale Christian Development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Con la Fundación Lohengrin siendo la primera en entrar, ayuda a asegurar a todos los demás”, dijo Townsell. Añadió que un premio de este tamaño puede ayudar a atraer inversores y financiamiento adicionales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Lawndale, localizado en la esquina de Springfield Avenue y Cermak Road, será un complejo deportivo pionero para el lado oeste. El centro deportivo y de recreación bajo techo de $38 millones permitirá la práctica de deportes durante todo el año, con dos campos de césped interior, seis canchas de baloncesto de tamaño completo, una sala de boxeo y acondicionamiento físico, un estudio de lucha libre, un salón multipropósito, áreas de comida y bar y una tienda profesional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Las ligas deportivas, los programas de mentoría y otras iniciativas estarán dirigidas por socios liderados por personas afroamericanas y latinas de North Lawndale y La Villita (South Lawndale).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uno de los objetivos de la iniciativa “Thriving Youth, Stronger Communities” es crear espacios seguros para los jóvenes para ayudar en la prevención de la violencia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Townsell cree que One Lawndale logrará eso ya que también ofrecerá programas de nutrición, salud mental y mentoría.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pensamos que algunas de las mejores acciones de prevención de la violencia que se pueden hacer son trabajar con jóvenes antes de que se vean involucrados en comportamientos por aburrimiento o porque realmente no tienen nada más que hacer”, agregó Townsell. “Para nosotros, poder tener algo así en el vecindario que sea de alta calidad y que tenga todos los demás apoyos necesarios, creemos que será el mejor esfuerzo en prevención de la violencia y construcción de comunidad”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Fundación Lohengrin está ayudando al desarrollador a encontrar otros socios fundacionales para cerrar su brecha de financiamiento, dijo Townsell. Espera comenzar la construcción a finales del verano o principios del otoño. Se prevé que esté terminado para el otoño o invierno de 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erie Neighborhood House utilizará su premio de $5 millones para el Centro de Erie House en La Villita.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La organización de servicios sociales ha estado en La Villita durante aproximadamente 20 años. Actualmente alquila un edificio en el vecindario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Villita Erie House, ubicada en 2653-59 S. Kildare Ave., permitirá a la organización no lucrativa ampliar su huella en el vecindario, tanto en el número de personas a las que sirve como en un espacio más grande y permanente. El edificio de cinco pisos tendrá espacios para niños, adolescentes y otros miembros de la comunidad, con el concepto final moldeado por la opinión de la comunidad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cristina De La Rosa, directora ejecutiva de Erie Neighborhood House, dijo que los miembros de la comunidad han expresado continuamente la necesidad de seguridad. La organización no lucrativa organizó grupos focales y distribuyó encuestas para escuchar más de los miembros de la comunidad sobre cómo sería un espacio seguro para los residentes y qué tipo de programación les gustaría ver en el nuevo centro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Queríamos ser realmente intencionales”, agregó De La Rosa. “Realmente queríamos asegurarnos de que cuando las personas ingresaran al edificio, sintieran que podían verse a sí mismas allí, que estaba diseñado para ellas”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El resultado es un centro con un gimnasio de tamaño completo, salones flexibles, un estudio de artes, oficinas de consejería y terapia privadas, salones para adolescentes y tecnología, cocina comunitaria, espacios verdes al aire libre, un parque infantil en la azotea y un jardín infantil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erie Neighborhood House ya ofrece una serie de programas juveniles, pero el nuevo centro permitirá a la organización ofrecer programación de todo el día después de la escuela, dijo De La Rosa. Y durante el verano, los niños en edad escolar pueden quedarse durante la semana y recibir desayuno, almuerzo y un refrigerio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erie Neighborhood House espera comenzar la construcción este otoño y abrir dentro de un año después de su inauguración. El proyecto de $22 millones expandirá las oportunidades para que la organización no lucrativa se asocie con otras organizaciones en la zona como One Lawndale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No vemos esto como dos vecindarios separados”, dijo Townsell sobre North Lawndale y La Villita. “Vemos esto como un Lawndale y personas uniéndose para apoyar a los jóvenes”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodríguez destacó que la fundación no tenía la intención de elegir a dos ganadores, y mucho menos dos de vecindarios adyacentes. Pero el premio está ayudando a conectar ambos proyectos con posibles socios de capital, duplicando su impacto previsto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-ff0000\" name=\"image-ff0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b285353/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1235x693+0+4/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0a%2Fc6%2F9880670a427aa01581599b9b39cd%2Fone-lawndale-recreation-center.jpeg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6b9c6dd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1235x693+0+4/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0a%2Fc6%2F9880670a427aa01581599b9b39cd%2Fone-lawndale-recreation-center.jpeg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bf91fe7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1235x693+0+4/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0a%2Fc6%2F9880670a427aa01581599b9b39cd%2Fone-lawndale-recreation-center.jpeg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Boceto del centro comunitario One Lawndale de la Christian Development Corp. de North Lawndale, un proyecto que reemplazaría un antiguo lote de almacenamiento de la CTA.\n\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bf91fe7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1235x693+0+4/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0a%2Fc6%2F9880670a427aa01581599b9b39cd%2Fone-lawndale-recreation-center.jpeg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5c08ca3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1235x693+0+4/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0a%2Fc6%2F9880670a427aa01581599b9b39cd%2Fone-lawndale-recreation-center.jpeg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bf91fe7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1235x693+0+4/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0a%2Fc6%2F9880670a427aa01581599b9b39cd%2Fone-lawndale-recreation-center.jpeg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boceto del centro comunitario One Lawndale de la Christian Development Corp. de North Lawndale, un proyecto que reemplazaría un antiguo lote de almacenamiento de la CTA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proporcionada por la Fundación Lohengrin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Lawndale y La Villita tienen mayores números de jóvenes y violencia juvenil, según la fundación.

But on Dec. 14, 2024, all of her hard work became validated when she became the inaugural WWE United States Champion. It was the culmination of her perseverance and consistency. The fans were behind her, eager to explode in euphoria after the ref made the 1-2-3 count after she hit what she calls the “super unprettier” to crown Green.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It took my breath away,” Green told the Sun-Times. “It was something that we dream of in wrestling. You go to do your finishing move, and everyone stands up and hopes that this is the moment. And as the referee counted 1-2-3, every single person in that building was counting, too. It just felt like that whole night was my night. Like I don't care what you witnessed on that night, who you saw wrestle like to me, that night was meant for me, and nobody can take it away from me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to know Green is to know that her path was anything but linear. It was filled with multiple bumps that forced her to redirect her path. WWE chief content officer Paul Levesque — also known by his ring name Triple H — used this Maya Angelou quote to define Green: “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s how Green has endeared herself to the WWE fan base. They’ve seen her get the rug pulled underneath her, like when she didn’t wrestle in her hometown of Vancouver, or be unceremoniously released. But she wasn't deterred, each time she just tried to find ways to reinvent herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘I thought that was the moment’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green began training to become a wrestler in January 2014, which was a fortuitous time to be trying to break into the industry in the women's division. Throughout 2014 — and turbo-charged in 2015 — women's wrestling transformed in WWE. The women went from being called \"divas\" to \"superstars\" and were given more time on the main roster after decades of being underutilized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green’s WWE journey began in August 2014 when she debuted on-air as Megan Miller, the physical therapist to Daniel Bryan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought that that was going to be the moment I was signed,” she said. “I was sure I did the best job I possibly could, and I was meant for WWE, and then I actually didn't get a call for another year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, she heard from the company about competing on Tough Enough, its reality show. Green said that producers told her she was going to win and earn a WWE contract, but it didn’t materialize. In the intervening years, she wrestled for companies like World Wonder Ring Stardom (WWRS), Total Nonstop Action (TNA) and at All Elite Wrestling’s inaugural show, All Out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In fact, I was not called again after being eliminated from tough enough until 2018, when I was hired ... and then I was fired during the pandemic,” Green said. “When I was rehired [in 2023], it just felt like now's my chance. Now is my time to hit the ground running. Now is my chance to prove to the fans, to prove to Triple H, to prove to creative, to prove to my co-workers, to all the indie wrestlers that I was meant for WWE.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green has done more than prove that she merely belongs in WWE. She’s shown she can be one of the top players in the country. Green has drawn the praises of wrestling luminaries like The Undertaker, who said on his podcast, “Six Feet Under,” that Green “can be a top player. She has that thing, that ‘it’ thing. And I just think there’s a lot of great things coming for that young lady. I’m a big fan of hers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s carved out a lane for herself by being willing to try anything on television — she was involved in the first WWE women’s dumpster match, which saw her get powerbombed into the dumpster by Michin. Green’s perseverance and determination also stood out to WWE superstar Cody Rhodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chelsea green is, I think, [someone] people in the business will say, like a survivor,” Rhodes told the Sun-Times. “I'm very, very proud of her. I don't think she realizes how special she is to the fans. And I think she still thinks the glass of water in front of her is her last, and it's not, but the good wrestlers always think that's the last one. And I wish that she could take an outside perspective and look at what she's done, and know she's done a lot, and it's an indication that she can do even more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the ups and downs she’s experienced throughout her career, Green doesn’t get caught up in her win-loss record. The lows birthed a self-awareness that is useful in the unpredictable world of professional wrestling in which plans change at a moment's notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I lose, and honestly, I lose often,” Green said. “I lose probably more than any other woman on the WWE roster. But at the end of the day, I'm traveling the world with some of my best friends, doing my dream job. I'm putting on sparkly gear, and I'm doing what I love in front of hundreds of millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to what’s next for Green, she doesn’t confine herself to the squared circle because she doesn’t have much control over whether she’s at WrestleMania or who she’s in a feud with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What I can focus on [are] my goals outside of professional wrestling,\" Green said. \"I want to improve my acting skills, my public speaking skills and my hosting skills to to make sure that I'm constantly building a resume that is undeniable. “ I would love to be the next John Cena of professional wrestling for the women's division. I would love to be in movies and TV and elevating the next generation of WWE talent, but that's a big goal. So, you know, I'm going to continue to work on that and put it out into the universe, and I'll manifest, and whatever happens, happens.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

That’s what happens in win-or-go-home situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Friday night is when it really starts to heat up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are previews and picks for a few of the best regional title games around the Chicago area, along with a quick rundown of every other 4A regional championship across the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. 10 St. Patrick (26-4) vs. No. 12 New Trier (25-7)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shapes up as potentially the game of the night. It’s one of those marquee 4 vs. 5 regional championship game matchups featuring two highly-ranked teams. Add in what should be a fantastic tournament atmosphere and it could be quite a night in Winnetka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How the two got here this week looked different on Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a walk-in-the-park win over rival Notre Dame in the regional semis, St. Pat’s is sky high heading into the title game. The Shamrocks, blessed with size and underestimated guard play, rolled the Dons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it got caught looking ahead, but New Trier didn’t exactly cruise in its opening regional win over big underdog Payton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thought to be competitive, though probably not a Champaign-bound contender in the preseason, St. Patrick has greatly exceeded expectations. The Shamrocks have been pretty much sizzling since early January losses to Curie (in overtime) and Benet, going 12-1 down the stretch behind RJ McPartlin (16 ppg, 9 rpg).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Trevians get to play at home and have three key pluses: a bonafide difference-maker in Christopher Kirkpatrick (16 ppg), shot-makers on the perimeter, including 6-4 guard Danny Houlihan (17 ppg), and very good positional length and size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That should all help in navigating a pretty staunch St. Pat’s 1-3-1 zone defense, because all of the options for New Trier can leave opposing coaches vexed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The pick: New Trier 50, St. Patrick 46&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No. 1 Curie (27-1) vs. No. 22 Lyons (23-6)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not too often you get two ranked teams playing in the regional final, particularly when one is the No. 9 seed in the sectional. But a red-hot Lyons gets an early shot at taking out the top-seeded team in the sectional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curie has been so steady and consistent, going about its business beating just about everyone. It’s one of those teams where the name on the back doesn’t matter. This Condors team is connected and blessed with a go-to player in guard Justin Oliver who blends in so nicely with his teammates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kendall Holliday is the overlooked contributor. The 6-4 senior does so much dirty work for the Condors. And while opponents must account for all that Holliday does, particularly on the glass and defensively, the emergence of 6-8 Keith Collins late in the season can’t be overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lyons has turned around a season that at one point seemed to be spiraling a bit. Coach Tom Sloan’s group has won 14 of its last 15, including 12 in a row after a December/January stretch where they went a combined 5-6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lions are still relatively young, but the nucleus of sophomore Grant Smith (17 ppg) and juniors Nate Woods (10 ppg) and Timmy Sloan do have experience. And senior Owen Carroll is a senior in the backcourt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The pick: Curie 62, Lyons 56&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No. 9 Loyola (26-6) vs. No. 20 Lincoln Park (21-8)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lincoln Park made the most of a wide-open city playoffs the past two weeks, making its first city title game appearance in over a century. Now the terrain gets a little steeper in a loaded sectional. Can the talented and promising Lions break through and beat a highly-ranked team when it really matters?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pair of senior guards have led the way for these two teams: Lincoln Park’s Ahmad Lee and Loyola’s Trey Williams. They are two lead guards with size, length and are stat-sheet stuffers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The always-promising Lee has put it together as a senior, averaging 14 points, six rebounds and six assists a game. Added production from senior Jaylin Dickerson and sophomore Alvin Robinson will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams, a 6-3 point guard headed to Cornell, has put together an outstanding but somewhat underappreciated senior season. He’s produced in a big way with multiple triple-doubles and is putting up 12 points, seven rebounds and seven assists a game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Loyola still tries to maximize the number of possessions it gets in a game, this is a more offensive-centered Loyola team this year. But there will still be enough defense to squeeze by Lincoln Park and get a crack at playing on its home floor in the sectional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The pick: Loyola 54, Lincoln Park 49&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mount Carmel (19-11) vs. St. Laurence (26-6)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While currently unranked, these are two teams that have been in rankings for quite a bit of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a 4 vs. 5 sectional seed game. Thus, this has all the makings of a guaranteed close game, featuring two talented teams full of youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mount Carmel’s talented freshmen, Ronald Johnson and DK Heard, along with junior Logan Wessel (12 ppg), form a nice trio for the present and especially the future. Although the Caravan have skidded in the tail end of the season, going just 4-6 in their last 10 games, those losses have come to ranked heavyweights. Even with its youth, this is a team that will surprise you with its physicality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markese Peoples has had a breakout season for St. Laurence. The big, versatile junior guard fills the stat sheet with 17 points, seven rebounds, three assists and two steals a game. Junior Reggie Stevens and sophomore Noah Corro are a pair of guards who also must be accounted for after solid seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of familiarity with one another. And it’s a Catholic League rematch from January when Mount Carmel came away with a 46-45 overtime win. Another tight one is expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The pick: St. Laurence 50, Mount Carmel 48&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No. 11 Marist (27-5) vs. No. 25 Rich (18-12)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RedHawks are hoping to avoid a deja vu moment. It was Rich, after all, that ended their season last year in the same gym in heartbreaking fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it’s Rich, a team that’s much better than any other 12-loss team in the state, as the underdog. But it’s an extremely dangerous No. 9 seed. Coach Lou Adams’ team is a real threat to make some noise in the postseason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were also tested in that regional semifinal win over solid Thornwood, so there are no first week postseason cobwebs. So the Raptors will be ready for highly-ranked Marist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich has been sparked by the return of senior Jamson Coulter. After a dynamic junior season, Coulter missed the majority of his senior season. But since his return he’s averaged 17 points in the last six games. Senior Kavon Ammons adds 16 a game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Raptors do apply disruptive pressure. But despite their balance, their offense just isn’t as potent or pack as much punch as a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marist has put together a terrific season with Charles Barnes playing like an all-state caliber player. Now it’s an opportunity to exact some revenge on a team that ended its season a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The pick: Marist 64, Rich 60&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a pick for every regional title game in the state’s largest class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glenbard East 62, Lake Park 48&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of teams headed in different directions. It’s back-to-back regional titles for the top-seeded Rams and star shooting guard Michael Nee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Batavia 45, Wheaton-Warrenville South 42&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two DuKane Conference teams split this season. This will inevitably go down to the wire and likely be a final-possession game. Defense travels and in case of a likely slugfest, that will help Batavia. The Bulldogs’ stingy defense gets the last stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;York 52, Glenbard West 44&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;York, one of the season’s really nice surprises and storylines, keeps it going. But on the road having to beat a conference team for the third time won’t be easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glenbard North 55, Wheaton North 51&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won’t find two more evenly matched teams on Friday night –– at least not when looking at the two regular-season battles. The two DuKane Conference teams just met last week in the regular-season finale. Wheaton North won that one 63-60. Glenbard North won the first matchup 53-51. Can there be a third straight one-possession game? Not quite. But it will be close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;St. Ignatius 60, Kenwood 54&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of Ignatius’ different weapons around its rock, senior Chris Bolte (17 ppg, 9 rpg) — and the home floor — are too much for the Broncos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Young 64, Simeon 58&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t Jahlil Okafor vs. Jabari Parker just a little over a decade ago. But it’s still Young and Simeon, two of the proudest, most successful programs in state history. But in this one the best player in the city and on the floor matters. Young’s Tennessee-bound guard Marquis Clark, who can humiliate defenses with dribble-drives, leads the way for the Dolphins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Homewood-Flossmoor 57, Lincoln-Way East 48&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a 1 vs. 10 seed but Lincoln Way East played H-F relatively well in two regular-season losses. But the overwhelming talent, highlighted by sophomore point guard Darrius Hawkins, pushes the Vikings to their third straight regional title.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brother Rice 54, Lincoln-Way Central 50&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one that could be up for grabs. Lincoln-Way Central is at home and has put together a sneaky solid season, but Brother Rice has played well down the stretch, winning nine of its last 11 games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lockport 64, Joliet West 59&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what a regional championship is supposed to look like, both from a geographical perspective and fan base familiarity standpoint. Lockport gets it done on its home floor behind the Venckus twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alton 60, Belleville East 50&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belleville East upset Belleville West on Wednesday. Now it gets a third shot at Alton after losing two regular-season games by double digits, including one that was played just last week. Alton is blessed with quite a pair in senior scoring guard Semaj Stampley and 6-4 junior Ryan Howard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Edwardsville 48, Collinsville 42&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collinsville might be only 14-16, but the Kahoks have played the top seed well in two losses, falling 47-40 and 43-41. Edwardsville has one of the underrated seniors in the state in 6-4 Miccah Butler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rock Island 68, Peoria Richwoods 64&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An entertaining game is set to be played in Minooka between two teams from outside the area. They’ve combined 52 wins between them. Plus, a couple of dynamic young guards in sophomore Amarion Smith-Holley of Richwoods and junior Deven Marshall of Rock Island will be on display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Normal 65, United 60&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal must take the long trek to East Moline. The Ironmen beat United 67-57 in early January. Aside from the shortened Covid season, Normal has won five straight regional titles. This will make six in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fremd 62, Lake Zurich 57&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the No. 1 seed, this is a troublesome spot for Fremd. Lake Zurich might be under the .500 mark and the No. 9 seed, but the record is deceiving considering the schedule the Bears have faced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stevenson 58, Buffalo Grove 50&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buffalo Grove took out fifth-seeded Hoffman Estates in the regional opener. But the 1-2 punch of Rocco Pagliocca (19 ppg) and Donny Williams (20 ppg) propel the Patriots here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Palatine 55, Barrington 47&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palatine, the No. 2 seed, must slow down high-scoring Oliver Gray of Barrington. This won’t be quite as tight as the regular-season matchup in January, where Palatine edged Barrington 52-51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hersey 50, Rolling Meadows 47&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pair of teams that know each other well in an old fashioned Mid-Suburban League battle. These two split during the regular season. The combined score of the two games: Rolling Meadows 96, Hersey 92. It will be another barnburner, but the edge goes to Hersey with Charlie Pomis (15 ppg).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DePaul Prep 58, Maine East 42&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be a lot of tight regional championship games across the state. This shouldn’t be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evanston 70, Niles North 61&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evanston has beaten Niles North twice already. When the Wildkits are rolling, it can look like a pretty elite offense with scoring and shooting capability. There is too much firepower for Evanston not to complete the three-game sweep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benet 60, West Aurora 42&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West Aurora will have the home floor. But it won’t have much else going for it against the state’s top team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Downers Grove South 60, Yorkville 51&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At No. 13, Yorkville is the lowest seeded team remaining in 4A, thanks to sophomore Joey Jakstys’ performance in an upset win over No. 4 seed Naperville North. But Adam Flowers and DGS get it done and move on to play top-ranked Benet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Neuqua Valley 66, Oswego East 52&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s always better to have two stars (Neuqua’s Cole Kelly and Mason Martin) than one (Oswego East’s Mason Lockett).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bolingbrook 72, Plainfield East 58&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plainfield East pulled off a minor upset over Oswego in double overtime to get its shot at Bolingbrook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warren 71, Libertyville 52&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaxson Davis and Company rolled past its North Suburban Conference foe twice this season — once by 17 points and most recently by 23 points. The stakes are raised but the results are the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rockford Auburn 74, Rockford Jefferson 52&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a mismatch any way you look at it after Auburn beat Jefferson by a combined 61 points in two regular-season matchups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waukegan 65, McHenry 52&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Waukegan rolled to a 39-point regional win on Wednesday, McHenry squeezed out a 53-50 win over Jacobs.&lt;/p&gt;",

The lowest grade the Bears received from their players was the C given to the grass surface at Soldier Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Bears ranked 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; out of 32 NFL teams. They were up one spot from last year, when they finished 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; overall. The Packers fell from seventh to 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;. The Vikings finished second and the Lions ninth, each for the second consecutive year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dolphins ranked first and the Steelers last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The survey is in its fourth year. The union published results in the first three but was barred from doing so this year. The NFL won a grievance against the NFLPA earlier this month to get the union to stop publishing their annual report cards, saying the disparagement of NFL teams and employees violated the collective bargaining agreement. The union said it would continue to conduct the surveys, even if they weren’t allowed to be published on the NFLPA’s web site.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Noem le había dicho a Ramírez en diciembre durante una audiencia del comité que se reuniría con ella tras repetidas solicitudes, a pesar de que Ramírez acusaba a la jefa de la agencia de &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2025/12/12/en-washington-la-representante-ramirez-llama-mentirosa-a-noem-y-duckworth-cuestiona-despliegues-de-trump\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;violar órdenes judiciales y mentirle al público.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La reunión comenzó y terminó con la demócrata de Illinois advirtiéndole a Noem que sus días en la administración podrían estar contados.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-170000\" name=\"module-170000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;La Voz Chicago WhatsApp&lt;/h3&gt;Encuentra más noticias en nuestro canal de WhatsApp. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb0XT1XCHDylm3rCs40P\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;b&gt;Síguenos.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Le dije, ‘Quiero ser bastante clara contigo a medida que comenzamos. Voy a decirte todo lo que te he dicho en público, y es importante que escuches esto directamente de mí. Primero, sigo pidiendo tu destitución’”, dijo Ramírez al Sun-Times. “‘Espero que renuncies. Si no renuncias o te destituyen, también reconozco que tus días pueden estar contados’, y creo que así es. Sin embargo, ella sigue siendo la secretaria. Ella claramente ocupa esa posición y, como tal, espero que cumpla su juramento y se atenga a las leyes de los Estados Unidos”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Al preguntarle sobre la reunión, DHS dijo en un comunicado que Noem se reúne regularmente con miembros del Congreso, independientemente de su partido. Pero un portavoz también culpó a los demócratas por el último cierre gubernamental.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Esperamos que la congresista ponga la misma cantidad de energía en financiar a DHS para que podamos hacer nuestro trabajo de proteger a los estadounidenses de amenazas de terroristas, criminales y peligros a la seguridad pública, así como lo ha hecho escribiendo cartas a la secretaria pidiendo su renuncia”, dijo un portavoz. “Cada día que este cierre continúa, a los miembros demócratas se les sigue pagando mientras ponen nuestra seguridad nacional en segundo plazo después de la política”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramírez llegó equipada con lo que ella llamó “acciones mínimas”. Incluyeron pedirle a Noem que restableciera áreas protegidas, incluyendo iglesias, escuelas y hospitales, de acuerdo con la solicitud de Noem para reinstaurar un memorando de 2021 del ex secretario de DHS, Alejandro Mayorkas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;También le pidió a Noem que estableciera y codificara estándares sobre el uso de la fuerza, argumentando que el departamento ha sido empoderado a través de la falta de supervisión y ha tenido demasiado margen para violar derechos bajo el pretexto de la seguridad. Ramírez lidera un esfuerzo para que se mantenga por ley la política de uso de fuerza del DHS. Según Ramírez, Noem le dijo que el departamento tiene un procedimiento para informes de uso de la fuerza y dijo que esto está cubierto en la capacitación.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Otra solicitud fue que Noem revocara un memorando de entrar a domicilios sin orden judicial, una política controversial que ha permitido a los agentes del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) entrar en hogares sin una orden de un juez  y pidió que el DHS respetara las leyes y regulaciones, incluyendo las leyes de registro de vehículos que prohíben intercambiar o cambiar placas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A raíz de informes sobre oficiales de inmigración federales conduciendo vehículos sin placas adecuadas o con placas modificadas, en octubre el secretario de Estado, Alexi Giannoulias, creó una línea de denuncias para recoger e investigar violaciones de placas. El anuncio ocurrió dos semanas después de que el Sun-Times le enviara pruebas de oficiales de DHS conduciendo en calles públicas &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2025/10/09/federal-immigration-officers-ice-dhs-license-plates-immigration\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;sin una o ambas placas de Illinois&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramírez también le dijo a Noem que los agentes federales deben cumplir con las órdenes judiciales, pero según Ramírez, Noem insistió en que los agentes efectivamente están siguiendo las órdenes. Cuando Ramírez insistió, Noem pidió más detalles sobre órdenes judiciales específicas que están violando. Ramírez mencionó que agentes del DHS utilizaron armas químicas al menos cuatro veces, a pesar de las órdenes de la jueza de distrito Sara Ellis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En una discusión sobre los centros de detención, Ramírez mencionó informes de todo el país sobre personas que no recibieron atención médica oportuna mientras estaban detenidas y sobre algunos de sus electores que detallaron escasez de alimentos en las instalaciones. Noem negó ante Ramírez que las personas no estén recibiendo atención médica y pidió una lista específica de personas que han presentado quejas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noem también le dijo a Ramírez que hay planes de “consolidar” algunos de los 225 centros de detención del país. No se refirió específicamente a Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramírez detalló incidentes en Chicago en los que las personas fueron rociadas con gas lacrimógeno al entrar en una tienda de comestibles a solo una cuadra de una escuela, niños siendo apresurados afuera de los patios de las escuelas y agentes químicos siendo rociados cerca de niños. También habló sobre visitas no anunciadas de agentes de inmigración federales en hospitales de la zona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Le dije, ‘Continúas negando lo que tus agentes están haciendo en el terreno, pero te voy a contar lo que he visto con mis propios ojos que hacen tus agentes’”, dijo Ramírez. “Ella actuó como si no tuviera idea de lo que estaba hablando, como si no supiera que tenía agentes en el hospital durante días esperando a uno de mis electores, que había sido herido mientras intentaban detenerlo”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramírez también le habló a Noem sobre &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz/2025/10/22/tras-ser-esposada-por-agentes-de-ice-concejal-jessie-fuentes-los-demanda-por-100k\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;la concejal Jessie Fuentes siendo esposada por agentes en un hospital de Humboldt Park&lt;/a&gt; cuando fue a revisar a ese elector en octubre. Fuentes les preguntó a los agentes si habían firmado una orden judicial y luego fue empujada por un agente, quien estaba completamente enmascarado y no llevaba identificación, según un video publicado en las redes sociales. Después de su tercera pregunta sobre una orden judicial, la concejal fue esposada. Fuentes fue liberada finalmente, pero desde entonces ha presentado un reclamo federal buscando $100,000 en daños.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramírez dijo que Noem le dijo repetidamente que le hiciera saber “cuando estas cosas están ocurriendo”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tú y yo sabemos que ella sabe lo que está sucediendo, y ha elegido ignorarlo”, dijo Ramírez. “Así que ella es la responsable”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

But according to outgoing Inspector General Deborah Witzburg, the system has turned into a “black hole” that leaves people in the dark about the status of the city’s response to their  complaints — and fosters distrust of government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witzburg reached that conclusion  after a comprehensive audit of the 28-year-old system, which is swamped with as many as 2.3 million requests annually for routine city services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a citywide survey of users of the 311 system and in-depth conversations with aldermanic staff in five wards, Witzburg identified a host of problems that prevents 311 from living up to its  potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents and businesses are not updated consistently about the status of their complaints or the city’s response. Those complaints can range from a broken street light or gaping pothole to missing, stolen or broken garbage carts, as well as rats in alleys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/weather/2025/12/12/chicago-kicks-off-snow-season-record-311-calls-ice-uncleared-sidewalks-roads\"   &gt;Chicago kicks off snow season with record number of 311 calls over uncleared sidewalks, roads&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Staffing constraints hamstring the city’s ability to pinpoint patterns of requests and improve services. Exacerbating the staffing shortage is the fact that 311 system employees are required to assist more than 40 city departments and local government agencies with their 311 system needs, but have “limited capacity to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing limited city resources more efficiently is “explicitly part of 311’s mission,” but no one is responsible for using the mountain of information from 311 requests to “deliver improved customer service.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People make a 311 request for a city service, go look at the status of their online request and see that it has been coded 'completed.’ But then, they look out their front window and they see that the pothole is still gaping in their street,” Witzburg told the Chicago Sun-Times. “If people are asking the government for help, and they are not getting the help that they need, and they’re not able to get any information about why they’re not getting help, or when it might come, we are risking public trust in the provision of city services.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To eliminate the “black hole” of service requests, Witzburg recommended that the Office of Emergency Management and Communications that operates both 911 and 311 “clarify its public resources about the service request process” and communicate more timely and accurate information to residents and businesses about the status of their service requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time when many private-sector businesses are using artificial intelligence to handle most, if not all, of their customer service requests, Witzburg also pushed for 311 staff to implement “technology solutions” to help multiple city departments “respond to requests efficiently in the field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audit also recommends a staffing analysis and that a so-called “service advocacy unit” hold regular meetings with city departments, in part to identify patterns of complaints that might trigger a realignment of city resources devoted to chronic problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its official response to Witzburg’s findings and recommendations, OEMC noted that the service advocacy unit “has not existed for several years.” But the department has attempted to fill the void by sending monthly emails to city departments “notifying them of open service requests.” Training is also provided to departments twice a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Management recognizes the importance of a centralized service advocacy function in supporting departments and maximizing the value of 311 data. However, the Service Advocacy Unit is no longer in existence. The responsibilities… have been absorbed into existing operational roles with limited capacity,” the OEMC response states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Management agrees that more structured and consistent engagement with departments would be beneficial and will continue to explore opportunities with existing resources to improve communication regarding system settings, service level agreement and best practices.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Mayor Richard M. Daley&amp;nbsp;created&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;311&amp;nbsp;system — at a cost of $4 million — to take the load off 911. At the time, 911 was handling 3.7 million calls a year, with as many as 40% nonemergencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nonemergency number was launched after a massive campaign to persuade Chicagoans to stop doing what 4,000 people did every day: call 911 about routine problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, a City Council rebellion forced Mayor Rahm Emanuel  to shelve his controversial plan to privatize 311 and find another way to bankroll a sorely needed system upgrade after alderpersons argued that services so pivotal to their residents must be provided by Chicagoans who know the city and its neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years later, Emanuel flipped the switch on an overhaul that not only allowed Chicagoans to text their service requests, along with photographic evidence, but also let the city text those same residents back to let them know when crews would do the work. Residents were supposed to get a text when work was completed.&lt;/p&gt;",

A defense attorney even told a judge Thursday that one member of that group has had “a change of heart” after discussing a pretrial diversion agreement — and now “wishes to proceed to trial.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors also acknowledged during Thursday's hearing that the timeframe of the alleged conspiracy is limited to Sept. 26, that it was “spontaneous” with no evidence of an explicit agreement, and that all potential co-conspirators were present at Broadview at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those acknowledgments came in response to a bid for a so-called bill of particulars, through which defense attorneys hoped to force prosecutors&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;to identify all alleged conspirators,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the timeframe of the conspiracy, and under which theory the feds planned to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perry did not grant their request, but she told them “we’ve gotten you quite a bit of the way there.” She said their real problem was that they “fundamentally do not believe the evidence supports a charge or a conviction.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A bill of particulars is not going to solve that problem,” Perry said. “A jury will.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/tracker-federal-prosecutions-chicago-status-trumps-immigration-blitz-ice\"   &gt;Tracking every known federal prosecution in Chicago tied to Trump’s immigration blitz&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Only one such case has gone to trial so far, and it &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2026/01/22/federal-jury-rejects-bovino-murder-plot-after-called-upon-stand-up-overreaching-government\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;ended with an acquittal&lt;/a&gt; last month. The Broadview conspiracy case is set for trial May 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former lead prosecutor in the Broadview case, Assistant U.S. Attorney Sheri Mecklenburg, withdrew Feb. 13. She’s now serving as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to a source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Mecklenburg has not been detailed to his staff. A spokesperson for Ranking Member Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, would not comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Andrew Boutros, called Mecklenburg \"an experienced prosecutor who applied for and received a temporary detail.\" He said, \"we wish her the best and look forward to her returning to our office.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defense attorneys for the six Broadview defendants say newly produced body-worn camera footage contradicts the feds’ claims about the case.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;The attorneys detailed the events of Sept. 26 in their recent court filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wrote that the defendants and others&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;engaged in a “Jericho Walk” near the Broadview facility, walking back and forth across a public crosswalk at Harvard Street and 25th Avenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadview police officers supervised the Jericho Walk and helped control traffic, including by stopping the demonstration “and parting the crowd of protesters when vehicles sought to pass through,” the attorneys wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Ford Expedition driven by an ICE agent turned “directly” into the crowd around 7:45 a.m., according to the defense filings. The attorneys said they’d seen no evidence of the ICE agent waiting for police assistance, but rather that he opted instead to&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“drive directly into where the crowd was gathered.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-6a0000\" name=\"image-6a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1acaceb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1058x594+0+67/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F61%2Fb2%2Fa8f8d7854b9fbb9893da8ab30660%2Fbview3.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/40d4bd7/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1058x594+0+67/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F61%2Fb2%2Fa8f8d7854b9fbb9893da8ab30660%2Fbview3.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eee56f6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1058x594+0+67/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F61%2Fb2%2Fa8f8d7854b9fbb9893da8ab30660%2Fbview3.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"__Bview3.png\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eee56f6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1058x594+0+67/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F61%2Fb2%2Fa8f8d7854b9fbb9893da8ab30660%2Fbview3.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ddf4f63/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1058x594+0+67/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F61%2Fb2%2Fa8f8d7854b9fbb9893da8ab30660%2Fbview3.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eee56f6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1058x594+0+67/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F61%2Fb2%2Fa8f8d7854b9fbb9893da8ab30660%2Fbview3.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A screenshot of footage that purportedly shows Brian Straw being pushed against a government SUV driving toward the immigration facility in Broadview on Sept. 26, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Court records&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Footage shows many of the defendants behind the Expedition as it drove toward the facility, the defense attorneys wrote.

So, instead of traveling to Tokyo this week to join Team Chinese Taipei for the World Baseball Classic, he withdrew from the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got to look at it like, what's the best long-term solution?” Long said Thursday. “Obviously, in the short term, I want to go. But we're more inclined to push through something that we shouldn't push through with such a strict timeline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long had been taking swings this week, testing his &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/21/how-tokyo-series-prepared-cubs-matthew-boyd-for-wbc-ramp-up\"   &gt;sprained left elbow&lt;/a&gt; to see if he could recover quickly enough to follow through on his WBC commitment. But on Thursday, the Cubs had Long pull back on activity to give him time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He has been a little sore swinging, so that's why we're backing off,” manager Craig Counsell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long said that the first night after hyperextending his elbow in an in-game collision last Saturday, the joint swelled up so much he barely could move it. But the swelling has dissipated in the days since, improving his range of motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's just getting to a spot where I can extend it fully, and not have pain in it, as well as, get the full range of motion this way,” Long said, flexing his arm. “So, that's what we're working on right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long dismissed the impact of the evolving bench-competition battle on his decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn't want to go there not knowing if I could hit or not,” he reiterated. “Then I’d waste 16 hours on a flight, plus everyone else's time, plus my time. So I just wanted to make sure I was going to be fully healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/25/cubs-tyler-austin-undergoes-knee-surgery-expected-to-be-out-for-months\"   &gt;backup first baseman Tyler Austin’s knee operation &lt;/a&gt;Tuesday cleared a path for Long to compete for a roster spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First baseman Michael Busch is lined up for an everyday role this season. But as the roster stands, whether Long begins the season on the major-league roster or in Triple-A, he’s the top backup option. Austin is expected to be out for “months,” according to Counsell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obviously, there's exterior decisions that I can't make,” Long said. “So I'm going to focus on what I can control and try to have the best camp I can have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Happiest moment of the game’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counsell said Thursday morning that his “happiest moment of the game” the day before, was a misplay from &lt;b&gt;Matt Shaw&lt;/b&gt; in right field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's kind of the NFL coach harping on ball security,” Counsell said. “Sometimes you don't think ball security in the outfield is that big a deal. And that tells you right there, it's a big deal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counsell has been consistent in saying that spring training mistakes are the best teachers as Shaw transitions to a super utility role and gets used to the outfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw also had a productive mid-game conversation with center fielder &lt;b&gt;Pete Crow-Armstrong&lt;/b&gt; on a dropped fly ball between them. That fly usually would be a routine play for Crow-Armstrong, but he was battling the sun, and it bounced off Shaw’s glove.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That's exactly the kind of stuff you want to have happen,” Counsell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Boyd Team USA-bound&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cubs left-hander &lt;b&gt;Matthew Boyd &lt;/b&gt;threw three hitless innings Thursday against the Angels in his last start before joining Team USA for the WBC. He said he’s scheduled to pitch in Team USA’s exhibition game Tuesday against the Giants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The fact that he hasn’t put that concern to rest by now is the reason he’s unlikely to get a contract extension going into the final season of his rookie deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears are set with top corner Jaylon Johnson signed through 2027 and nickel corner Kyler Gordon beginning an extension that runs through ’28, but the other outside spot is hazy. That makes it very possible the Bears would draft a cornerback in the first or second round — those picks are at Nos. 25 and 57 overall — despite a significant list of other needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With free agency a little over a week away, the Bears must fill starting spots at left tackle, at least one safety spot and likely at linebacker with &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/25/bears-linebacker-tremaine-edmunds-permission-seek-trade-nfl-cut-salary-cap-15-million\"   &gt;the expected departure of Tremaine Edmund&lt;/a&gt;s. That’s before considering upgrades on the defensive line and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found a short-term answer at cornerback last season in journeyman Nahshon Wright, who had five interceptions, but he’s likely to take advantage of his first shot at a big contract and leave in free agency. As of now, Stevenson would be penciled in opposite Johnson, and the Bears showed last season they weren’t fully confident in that option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of an up-and-down season, Stevenson didn’t start the final five games, including the playoffs. The Bears didn’t play him in the regular-season finale against the Lions, and he played less than one-third of the snaps in each playoff game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's simply too important of a position for them to go into the season without a sure plan, as the Bears saw before general manager Ryan Poles’ arrival when they had Johnson and virtually no one else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best corners likely to be available for the Bears late in the first round are Clemson’s Avieon Terrell, Tennessee’s Colton Hood. They could hope for Indiana’s D’Angelo Ponds, South Carolina’s Brandon Cisse or San Diego State’s Chris Johnson toward the end of the second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any of those potential draft picks would enter what appears to be an open competition for a starting job, alongside Stevenson and fellow fourth-year corner Terell Smith. The Bears also drafted Zah Frazier in the fifth round last season and expect him to play this season after missing his rookie year on the Non-Football Injury list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not coming to the NFL to be on the bench,” Hood said Thursday at the NFL Scouting Combine. “I’m planning to be a starter and take somebody’s job. That’s the harsh world we live in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's a superb understanding of the NFL from someone who has yet to play in it, and the Bears will be increasingly tough graders on Stevenson as their contractual commitment to him shrinks and as they seek to become a championship contender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears drafted him in the second round at No. 56 overall in 2023, and he’s never been on firm footing. Instead of walking right into an open starting job, he spent part of his rookie season in a position battle with Smith, who went in the fifth round more than 100 picks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there was the Fail Mary in 2024, which is only going to fade if Stevenson becomes a Pro Bowl player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last season, Stevenson made huge plays with an interception and two forced fumbles, but remained unsteady. If the Bears are serious about winning now, they can only wait so long for him to eliminate doubts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

It’s the sixth straight year in which the district kicks off classes before Labor Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district unveiled the calendars last month and presented them at a CPS board meeting but sought further feedback from community members after board members raised questions about the timing around winter break and the end of the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second academic quarter ends after the break, on Jan. 22, 2027. Board members were concerned that students, particularly high schoolers, wouldn’ t be able to reset and wind down during their vacation because they’d be worried about coming back to end-of-quarter tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, the district opened a survey from Jan. 21 through Jan. 27 to ask community members to choose between three calendar options: the one recommended by the district and two that would have started classes earlier in August to complete the second quarter before winter break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicole Milberg, CPS chief of teaching and learning, presented the findings at a board meeting earlier this month. More than 22,000 people responded, and 55% preferred the original schedule recommended by the district, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milberg acknowledged at that meeting that not everyone will be satisfied with the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no perfect calendar, no matter how many times we go to the drawing board. There will never be a calendar that meets every stakeholder's preferences,” Milberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The schedule allows students to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/01/12/chicago-public-schools-releases-2026-2027-calendar-with-longer-summer-break\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;enjoy their typical number of summer vacation days&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after last year’s shortened break of just 67 days. The last day of the current school year is on June 4, resulting in 81 days of vacation before classes begin again in late August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School started later in the 2024-25 academic year because of the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2024/2/1/24058117/cps-calendar-2024-25-school-year-dnc-push-back-date\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Democratic National Convention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a shorter break. In summer 2024, students also had 81 days of break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 2026-2027 school year students will continue to get a week off for Thanksgiving break, as well as a day off for the congressional midterm elections on Nov. 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winter break is scheduled for Dec. 21 through Jan. 1, 2027, while spring break will be from March 22-26, 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The start of the 2027-2028 school year is set for Aug. 23, 2027, and the last day will be on June 9, 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the newly approved calendars add up to 176 student attendance days, with 14 non-student attendance days for staff training, school improvement work and parent-teacher conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-900000\" name=\"image-900000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/24616e4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/813x456+0+56/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F15%2Fd9edf7724613b62ec0e91bce8ef9%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-26-142544.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/71a3f81/2147483647/strip/true/crop/813x456+0+56/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F15%2Fd9edf7724613b62ec0e91bce8ef9%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-26-142544.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7e20405/2147483647/strip/true/crop/813x456+0+56/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F15%2Fd9edf7724613b62ec0e91bce8ef9%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-26-142544.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The Chicago Public Schools calendar for the 2026-27 academic year.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7e20405/2147483647/strip/true/crop/813x456+0+56/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F15%2Fd9edf7724613b62ec0e91bce8ef9%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-26-142544.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d294b61/2147483647/strip/true/crop/813x456+0+56/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F15%2Fd9edf7724613b62ec0e91bce8ef9%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-26-142544.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7e20405/2147483647/strip/true/crop/813x456+0+56/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F34%2F15%2Fd9edf7724613b62ec0e91bce8ef9%2Fscreenshot-2026-02-26-142544.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Public Schools calendar for the 2026-27 academic year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

The deal led the then-acting commissioner of the IRS to resign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several ongoing cases that challenge the IRS-DHS agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit declined to issue a preliminary injunction for the immigrants’ rights group, Centro de Trabajadores Unidos, and other nonprofits that are suing the federal government to stop implementation of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In declining the preliminary injunction request, Judge Harry T. Edwards wrote that the nonprofit groups “are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim,” since the information the agencies are sharing isn’t covered by the IRS privacy statute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, two separate court orders have blocked the agencies from massive transfers of taxpayer information and blocked ICE from acting upon any IRS data in its possession.

Así que miré la foto y la comparé con la persona y me di cuenta, ‘Oh, este es el conductor’”, contó el médico, que prefirió no ser identificado, al Chicago Sun-Times días después del ataque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;También llamó al número que aparecía en la aplicación y notó que el teléfono en el suelo junto a Figueroa comenzó a sonar, dijeron el miércoles los fiscales del Condado de Cook durante una audiencia de detención de la sospechosa, Montoya Perry, de 33 años.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vi cuál era su nombre en la aplicación, así que traté de acercarme, lo llamé por su nombre y no respondía en absoluto”, dijo el médico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Según los fiscales y un informe de la Policía de Chicago, los oficiales que respondieron descubrieron un video que mostraba a tres personas, incluyendo a Perry, acercándose a la van Dodge Caravan azul clara de Figueroa, que había dejado prendida y estacionada en la zona de giro del hospital, en 645 S. Central Ave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mientras Figueroa entraba al hospital para entregar la comida, Perry se subió al asiento del conductor de su van y las otras dos personas se subieron a los asientos del pasajero, según los fiscales. Cuando Figueroa los vio intentando llevarse su van, corrió hacia ella. Agarró la manija de la puerta del pasajero delantero y se sostuvo mientras Perry aceleraba, arrastrando a Figueroa por el suelo y atropellándolo con la llanta trasera, dijeron los fiscales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El médico dijo que él y otros transeúntes que se detuvieron se quedaron con Figueroa hasta que llegaron los equipos de emergencia minutos después de que llamó al 911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-4c0000\" name=\"image-4c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/05bcf5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1918x1076+0+132/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2Fcf%2F6770b57041bfb46b691fb85748ea%2Fdaniel-figueroa.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/eee469c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1918x1076+0+132/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2Fcf%2F6770b57041bfb46b691fb85748ea%2Fdaniel-figueroa.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1042d8a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1918x1076+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2Fcf%2F6770b57041bfb46b691fb85748ea%2Fdaniel-figueroa.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Daniel L Figueroa\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1042d8a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1918x1076+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2Fcf%2F6770b57041bfb46b691fb85748ea%2Fdaniel-figueroa.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/95e35e1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1918x1076+0+132/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2Fcf%2F6770b57041bfb46b691fb85748ea%2Fdaniel-figueroa.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1042d8a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1918x1076+0+132/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Faf%2Fcf%2F6770b57041bfb46b691fb85748ea%2Fdaniel-figueroa.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Una mujer ha sido detenido por el asesinato de un conductor de Uber Eats de 28 años, Daniel L.

La causa y el modo de su muerte no se conocieron de inmediato. Una autopsia realizada el martes fue inconclusa, detalló el médico forense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perry fue arrestada más tarde esa misma mañana del ataque después de que la policía utilizó cámaras lectoras de placas para localizar la van de Figueroa en Maywood. A eso del mediodía del lunes, la policía observó a Perry salir de un auto diferente que se detuvo junto a la van estacionada de Figueroa y luego subirse al asiento del conductor de la van, dijeron los fiscales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perry llevaba la misma chamarra café y pantalones rosas que se la vio usando en las imágenes de vigilancia afuera del hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuando los oficiales se acercaron a ella, Perry huyó y aventó las llaves de la van de Figueroa, dijeron los fiscales. Fue arrestada tras una breve persecución.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La hermana de Perry, que estaba con ella en el momento de su arresto, supuestamente dijo que también estuvo con ella la noche anterior, pero se separaron antes del incidente en el hospital. La hermana de Perry supuestamente confirmó que Perry llevaba la misma ropa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perry también supuestamente le dijo a los oficiales que tomó la van de Figueroa y admitió haberlo visto correr hacia el vehículo mientras ella aceleraba. También se identificó en el video de vigilancia afuera del hospital, dijeron los fiscales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Durante su primera comparecencia ante la corte el miércoles, un juez del Condado de Cook ordenó que Perry permaneciera en la cárcel mientras espera juicio por cargos de asesinato y robo vehicular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perry tiene varias condenas anteriores por delitos graves, incluidos falsificación, uso ilegal agravado de un arma, robo agravado y robo. Regresará a la corte el 18 de marzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Estamos increíblemente tristes por esta trágica pérdida, y nuestros pensamientos están con su familia y seres queridos mientras navegan por este momento inimaginablemente difícil”, dijo un comunicado enviado por correo electrónico de Uber. “Nos hemos comunicado con la policía y los asistiremos en lo que podamos”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En una declaración, un portavoz de la directora ejecutiva del Hospital Loretto, Tesa Anewishki, dijo que el hospital estaba al tanto del “trágico incidente” y que los funcionarios del hospital están colaborando plenamente con las autoridades locales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“En nombre del Hospital Loretto, nuestras oraciones y condolencias están con la familia y seres queridos del individuo”, dijo el portavoz. “Nuestro enfoque sigue siendo apoyar la seguridad, salud y bienestar de la comunidad a la que servimos durante este tiempo difícil”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El médico, que ha trabajado en Loretto aproximadamente 2 años y medio, dijo que la zona había sido segura y que el ataque lo ha dejado con “mucho que procesar” en los días posteriores. Aún se pregunta qué fue exactamente lo que le sucedió a Figueroa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Simplemente no sé cómo llegamos a esto”, dijo el médico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traducido con una herramienta de inteligencia artificial (AI) y editado por &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/la-voz\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;La Voz Chicago&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Administrators cited financial troubles due to a significant drop in international graduate student enrollment, increased demand for financial aid and the rising costs of benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As part of our responsibility to ensure long-term financial sustainability for our university, we are continuing to engage in ongoing budget planning discussions,” said university leadership in a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://offices.depaul.edu/president/notes-from-rob/2025-2026/Pages/arts-dpam.aspx\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday about the museum closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2025, DePaul’s museum lost an expected $500,000 in funding from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. That funding supported a partnership with Chicago Public Schools, said Laura-Caroline de Lara, the museum’s director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A November 2025 survey from the American Alliance of Museums found that one-third of U.S. museums (34%) have struggled in the wake of the cancellation of government grants and contracts after a series of Trump executive orders that impact the arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funds cut for museums came primarily from the IMLS, the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De Lara said the museum’s closure is a “deep loss” for DePaul and the greater Chicago arts scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It means that there are so many students and professors that have lost a really important resource for their teaching and learning,” she said. “I think we were a place that became known for our transparency and for our care for our audiences and the artists that we work with. … It feels like a real great cultural loss for the city.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the museum opened &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/art/2025/09/24/depaul-art-museum-young-lords-exhibit-chicago-tengo-lincoln-park-en-mi-corazon\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;“Tengo Lincoln Park en mi Corazón: Young Lords in Chicago,”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which takes a look at the Puerto Rican civil rights organization that got its start in the same neighborhood the museum and university call home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides de Lara, only one other full-time employee remains. Ionit Behar, a former curator, left the museum earlier this month for a job at the Museum of Contemporary Art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closure announcement comes after months of museum leadership working closely with the university to find common ground and keep the museum open through the end of the academic year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I worked to fundraise to be able to keep all of our positions through the end of the year,” de Lara said. Student workers also will keep their positions through June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its full statement on Thursday, the university said it would not sell the building at 935 W. Fullerton nor leave it empty. But the future of more than 4,000 objects in the museum’s &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://resources.depaul.edu/art-museum/collection/Pages/default.aspx\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;collection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is unclear for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collection includes more than 1,000 photographs by artists including Andy Warhol and Chicagoans Dawoud Bey and Paul D’Amato. The museum also has a considerable holding of West African objects and Latino art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're working now to put together options for the university in terms of the collection so that we can ensure that the collection continues to be cared for,” de Lara said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two final exhibitions featuring the work of painters &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://resources.depaul.edu/art-museum/exhibitions/Pages/barbara-nessim-my-compass-is-the-line.aspx\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Barbara Nessim&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://resources.depaul.edu/art-museum/exhibitions/Pages/alice-tippit-rose-obsolete.aspx\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;Alice Tippit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are set to open at DPAM on March 5 and run through the museum’s closure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Artists are the key to what we do, in addition to the students,” de Lara said. “I don't want their opening and the celebration of their work to get lost amidst all of this.”&lt;/p&gt;",

On Feb. 14, 2027, ESPN will produce its first Super Bowl, and as the running joke goes, its pregame show is already underway. And Tennant is leading the charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the buildup, ESPN is airing a weekly series of short videos called “I Scored a Touchdown,” which will spotlight 61 players who reached paydirt in the Super Bowl. ESPN’s first Super Bowl will be Super Bowl LXI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The series began with the story of Giants wide receiver David Tyree, who’s known best for the “Helmet Catch” in the upset of the undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. Earlier in the game, he scored an often-overlooked touchdown for a 10-7 lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up is Bears legend Devin Hester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you have a momentous achievement like that, it moved his name higher up on our list of priorities,” Tennant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pro Football Hall of Famer is the only player to return the opening kickoff of a Super Bowl for a touchdown. He did so one year before Tyree’s heroics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When ESPN reached out to Hester’s camp for an interview, the NFL’s all-time leader in return touchdowns (20) almost immediately agreed. A producer based in Florida, where Hester lives, conducted the interview a few months ago. The nearly three-minute video brings the moment back to life. It’s airing on “SportsCenter,” “NFL Live” and other ESPN shows through Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea for the series predates Tennant’s role, which began in January 2025. After being granted two Super Bowls as part of the NFL’s media-rights deal announced in March 2021, Tennant and a group of creatives would meet periodically to brainstorm programming ideas. Tennant said he gravitated toward this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the most talented storytellers here at ESPN that I’ve ever worked with, a guy by the name of Mike Farrell, he pitched the idea of, what if we did something that showcased the stories, the characters, the moments surrounding scoring a touchdown in the Super Bowl,” said Tennant, who has been with ESPN for more than 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tennant turned the concept into a weekly series to keep the Super Bowl at the front of viewers’ minds throughout the year. Once it got the green light, ESPN had football researcher John Parolin assemble a list of every player who has scored a touchdown in the Super Bowl. That doesn’t include players throwing a touchdown pass, only players crossing the goal line. After Super Bowl LX, Parolin has a chronological list of 240 touchdowns. Hester’s was No. 154.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no exact science to selecting which 61 touchdowns will be presented and in what order. The videos aren’t meant to break down each play as much as they are to tell the story behind the play and how it has affected each player’s life. Tyree went first because of the “Helmet Catch.” Hester is next because of his singular achievement. The series is still a work in progress, with 30 videos completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another former Bear could appear among the remaining videos. Four scored in the team’s 46-10 walloping of the Patriots in Super Bowl XX, but one of them stands out – William “The Refrigerator” Perry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He is on our list,” Tennant said. “That is one of the more memorable moments in Super Bowl history. He is high on our list, and we are in contact with his camp to make that interview happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not guaranteed to happen. Perry has to agree to it. Tennant said everyone ESPN has contacted has been very receptive, and it’s hopeful others will follow. The network is making every effort to inquire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such efforts will continue for the next year as Tennant and his team roll out more programming across the Walt Disney Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are taking this incredibly seriously,” he said, “and as excited as we are, we’re laser-focused on making this the greatest Super Bowl ever.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Remote patrol&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Sports Network will stream its remaining seven White Sox spring-training broadcasts for free on the CHSN app and website, including the game March 13 against the Cubs. The final two also will simulcast over the air on The U (WCIU-Channel 26). CHSN figures to simulcast a select number of regular-season games on The U, as it did last season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• At long last, ESPN Unlimited is available to Comcast customers for free. Those who receive ESPN will get an email within days with instructions for activation. If you can’t wait, go to ESPN’s support site or your subscription page on Xfinity.com to link your account.&lt;/p&gt;",

Kam Buckner  took his first of two rides in a self-driving car in  Silicon Valley last year,   he felt a bit like George Jetson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wasn’t scared for his present-day safety. And he was intrigued about the transportation future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was different… It’s not going to be for everybody. Like when I go to the store — I like the fact that there are self check-out lanes, but I don’t use those. I want to talk to a person,” Buckner (D-Chicago) said Thursday. “ It’ll be different if we decide to move forward with it. But it’s worth us having a conversation now, so we’re not blindsided in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Buckner made the case for state legislation he is championing that would make a test of driverless cars possible in five Illinois counties:  Cook, Sangamon, Madison, St. Clair and Monroe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The still-pending bill would set the stage for a three-year pilot program in those  counties to test the consumer appetite for autonomous vehicles, and gather a host of information about the impact on traffic congestion, jobs and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckner called it a “test case to see if things work and what we need to do different” than the 29 other states that have authorized driverless vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago and other municipalities would still need to authorize driverless vehicles and establish their own safety and regulatory rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waymo’s self-driving cars &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/transportation/2026/02/25/waymo-autonomous-vehicle-robotaxi-buckner-johnson\"   &gt;hit the streets&lt;/a&gt; of Chicago this week — with drivers, for now — to begin the process of mapping the city for the switch to autonomous vehicles.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When California did...  they didn’t do this type of pilot. They just kind of rolled it out. When Arizona did it, they did the same thing. Same with Texas,” Buckner told the Sun-Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-3d0000\" name=\"image-3d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/55c581a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3488x1958+0+382/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F51%2F97%2F5af3266c8eb324666c77d9d2d8ef%2Fghostgun-051922-8-buckner.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a51427f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3488x1958+0+382/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F51%2F97%2F5af3266c8eb324666c77d9d2d8ef%2Fghostgun-051922-8-buckner.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c24090/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3488x1958+0+382/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F51%2F97%2F5af3266c8eb324666c77d9d2d8ef%2Fghostgun-051922-8-buckner.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Chicago mayoral candidate and state Rep.

Kam Buckner is proposing legislation that would set up a three-year testing period for driverless vehicles in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pat Nabong/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is obviously coming to Illinois. They’re going to at least attempt to. So we should get ahead of the curve here and make sure that we are dictating the pace and the conversation,\" Buckner continued. \"We should have at least three years of data, three years of experience and some real understanding of how these work here within our state lines to see if it makes sense for Illinois.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driverless vehicles have generated controversy for a host of reasons that range from concerns about safety and consumer cost to the impact on jobs. Buckner said he has “the same concerns when it comes to labor and safety.” Which is why he favors a go-slow approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not just trying to fill the streets with these cars and knock people out of their jobs. In fact, I’m chief sponsor of another bill that would unionize ride share drivers in Illinois. We can do both,\" he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-driving vehicles operated by Waymo, Uber Tesla and other companies have traveled a rocky road for the last decade, with a documented history of crashes that have triggered dozens of fatalities and injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, a 49-year-old woman was walking her bicycle across a road outside a designated crosswalk in Tempe, Arizona when she was struck and killed by a self-driving SUV operated by Uber with a human backup driver who was not monitoring the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uber’s testing privileges were suspended by the Arizona governor. The back-up driver pleaded guilty to endangerment and was sentenced to three years of supervised probation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years later, a driver hit a pedestrian in San Francisco and threw the woman into the path of a self-driving vehicle that ran the woman over. The self-driving vehicle did not detect the pedestrian and dragged her more than 20 feet at 7 miles per hour as it attempted to pull over to the side of the road. The woman suffered serious injuries, but survived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ald. Daniel La Spata (1st) who chairs the City Council’s Committee on Pedestrian and Traffic Safety, said his biggest concern is a state-authorized pilot program that “pre-empts home-rule regulation” of autonomous vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I understand for a lot of folks the need to act expeditiously. But we need to have hearings on this to have those discussions and understand what are the strengths and weaknesses of autonomous vehicles,” La Spata said. “They trumpet safety benefits and statistics. At the same time, we do see those cases where children and others have been injured or killed. And we need to… take all that into account. I don’t want to move so expeditiously that we put ourselves in a position where we can’t respond to those issues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"HtmlModule\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"html-embed-module-4a0000\" name=\"html-embed-module-4a0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;iframe allow=\"monetization\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://play.prx.org/e?ge=prx_12963_8dd52490-a6ac-407d-8de2-897b35cf2a25&amp;uf=https%3A%2F%2Fpublicfeeds.net%2Ff%2F12963%2Ffeed-rss.xml\" style=\"min-width: 300px;\" width=\"100%\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
