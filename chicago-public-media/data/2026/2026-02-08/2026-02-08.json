The boy was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary autopsy findings indicated the boy suffered from malnourishment and physical abuse, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy’s 10-year-old brother was hospitalized after speaking with the Lake County Children's Advocacy Center, which determined he also showed signs of abuse and malnourishment. Their step-sibling, a 3-year-old boy, also lived at the home and was placed in the care of the state Department of Children and Family Services, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children’s mother, Dominique Servant, 33, and her boyfriend, Joey Ruffin, 38, were taken into custody Friday night, police said. Both are charged with two counts of first-degree murder and one count of child endangerment causing death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities are attempting to contact the children's biological father, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Servant and Ruffin are due in court Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;",

Another important evaluation test for a front office that has more fails than passes in that department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adding four guards in the week leading up to the Feb. 5 trade deadline, the Bulls gave themselves a runway of 30 games – including Saturday’s – to evaluate Simons, Collin Sexton, Rob Dillingham and Jaden Ivey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simons and Sexton are in the final years of their current contracts and will become unrestricted free agents, while Ivey will be a restricted free agent. Dillingham is on his rookie contract but considering how poorly things were going in Minnesota for him, the Bulls need to find out why and was it fixable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not an ideal situation for the team to be in considering they are in a rebuild – or as executive vice president of basketball operations Arturas Karnisovas says, a new “stage – and every decision has consequences that help the seed grow or kill it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the day I tell myself, ‘Hey, just be where the feet are at,’ “ Sexton said of his approach to the rest of the season. “Don’t look too far in advance and when I’m doing that I feel like I’m at my best. Just give it my all for this organization, give my all to this team, show them what I can do. I just know that’s something I can control. Each and every day coming in with the right energy. Being a true professional is something I can control and the rest will take care of itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where coach Billy Donovan comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karnisovas and general manager Marc Eversley can watch the basketball part of their new guard room, but it’s Donovan that will be with the players on an almost daily basis between now and mid-April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me a lot of it comes down to the way I look at from the lens of the mentality piece,” Donovan said on Saturday. “That’s kind of what I’m looking at. To me it’s more of the competitiveness, the mentality, how are they in the locker room, how are they as teammates, can they follow game-plan discipline, all those types of things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donovan admitted that he had a meeting with the front office on Friday to figure out playing time and if they had an edict on a minutes priority. After all, it would make sense to see more of Dillingham and Ivey since they are more likely to be kept, but Donovan said there was none of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think at least the feeling from the front office was they wanted to see kind of all these guys that are in here right now,” Donovan said. “It hasn’t been, ‘Hey, we want you to play this guy, this guy.’ They want these guys to go out and compete, see how well they can fit in to how we’ve been trying to play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music to Dillingham’s ears, who was begging for a new start after a season-and-a-half with the Timberwolves and diminishing minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job interview? For the second-year guard it almost feels like a career change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m just trying to show I can play basketball, I belong here and I can help the team win,” Dillingham said. “I’m not looking at it as something specific.”&lt;/p&gt;",

The &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/super-25-basketball-rankings/2026/02/01/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;No. 20 Dukes&lt;/a&gt; pack the paint with three big, wide, strong and smart football players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter Stepanich, a 6-7 tight end, is heading to Princeton. Georgetown Costa Kampas is a 6-5, 275-pound powerhouse offensive tackle, and 6-4 Jackson Rennick is a lineman heading to Wisconsin-Whitewater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We know we are probably one of the most physical teams in the state and one of the best rebounding teams, so we play to our strengths,\" Stepanich said. \"Our defense is the trademark of the team. The guys are all getting up and pressuring because when someone gets through there is me, Costa and Jackson. We can clean up down low and cover the corners. Our defense makes people uncomfortable, and we capitalize on that.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;York held host Libertyville without a field goal in the third quarter on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/07/chicago-high-school-basketball-scores-illinois\"   &gt;Saturday&lt;/a&gt; and went on to win 47-41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dukes (24-4) have used their size and bulk to become the area's most surprisingly successful team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If you would have told us we'd be 24-4 right now we would have said you are crazy,\" York coach Mike Dunn said. \"But our kids believe and there is a great bond on the team. They like each other and they hang out with each other outside of basketball. That makes things a lot easier.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior Joseph Ubbe led the Dukes with 17 points and Stepanich added 12 points and seven rebounds. Stepanich was matched up against Libertyville's 6-9 Bryce Wegrzyn in a rare big-man battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I've played against him a few times and he's a great player,\" Stepanich said. \"I've seen him get better and better the past few years and I was excited for this game. There aren't many big man battles, so it is always a good time when one comes around.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wegrzyn, a Winona State recruit, hurt his eye early in the second half and finished with 10 points. He tried to play through it for a while, but spent most of the fourth quarter on the bench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"His vision was blurry and I didn't see any point in risking anything,\" Libertyville coach Brian Zyrkowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior guard Trevor Wallace led the Wildcats (14-9) with 12 points. Libertyville trailed by 12 points with 6:32 left but made three three-pointers to tighten things up. A three from Ben Kristopher with 34 seconds left cut the deficit to 46-41 but that was as close it would get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;York's football team has made deep playoff runs the past several years, but that wasn't the case this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I do think it impacted the team,\" Kampas said. \"The brotherhood this year is really special. And being with the team for 2 to 3 weeks longer made a difference. This is an incredibly close-knit group.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d40000\" name=\"image-d40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a8d0c8c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6940x3895+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F36%2F22%2F5b826ab1457485e1c83d428cd993%2Fob-cst-020826-007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/196d303/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6940x3895+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F36%2F22%2F5b826ab1457485e1c83d428cd993%2Fob-cst-020826-007.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ebfe312/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6940x3895+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F36%2F22%2F5b826ab1457485e1c83d428cd993%2Fob-cst-020826-007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"York’s Jackson Rennick (52) chest bumps Joseph Lubbe (25) during the game against Libertyville.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ebfe312/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6940x3895+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F36%2F22%2F5b826ab1457485e1c83d428cd993%2Fob-cst-020826-007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a04384/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6940x3895+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F36%2F22%2F5b826ab1457485e1c83d428cd993%2Fob-cst-020826-007.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ebfe312/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6940x3895+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F36%2F22%2F5b826ab1457485e1c83d428cd993%2Fob-cst-020826-007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;York’s Jackson Rennick (52) chest bumps Joseph Lubbe (25) during the game against Libertyville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirsten Stickney/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;York's coaching staff has been surprised by the team's success, but the senior leaders had this in mind all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This was our opportunity to step up and lead as a senior class, and we always knew we would be ready,\" Stepanich said. \"And our coaches put us in a great position to make it happen.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is awesome, playing with some friends I've known since I was 5 years old and having this success,\" Kampas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dukes won ten consecutive games before losing to Lyons on Tuesday.

[The culture] is very strong, but hidden.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-580000\" name=\"image-580000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de77d2b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4950x2778+0+261/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1b%2F0d%2F109417fb4b7fb5f7829b693bb26e%2Fautoshow-260208-04.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1544ff1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4950x2778+0+261/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1b%2F0d%2F109417fb4b7fb5f7829b693bb26e%2Fautoshow-260208-04.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72638c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4950x2778+0+261/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1b%2F0d%2F109417fb4b7fb5f7829b693bb26e%2Fautoshow-260208-04.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Matt Conger with his Toyota MR2. “I am so humbled,” Conger said of being selected to be among the inaugural group of cars chosen for the first Chi-Town Alley display.  \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72638c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4950x2778+0+261/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1b%2F0d%2F109417fb4b7fb5f7829b693bb26e%2Fautoshow-260208-04.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1bf1740/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4950x2778+0+261/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1b%2F0d%2F109417fb4b7fb5f7829b693bb26e%2Fautoshow-260208-04.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72638c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4950x2778+0+261/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1b%2F0d%2F109417fb4b7fb5f7829b693bb26e%2Fautoshow-260208-04.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Conger with his Toyota MR2. “I am so humbled,” Conger said of being selected to be among the Chi-Town Alley Showcase finalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giacomo Cain/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-310000\" name=\"module-310000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chicago Auto Show&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;When:&lt;/b&gt; Through Feb. 16&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt; McCormick Place, 2301 S.

They also participated in a meet and greet with “Fast &amp;amp; Furious” franchise actor Sung Kang, who made an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the biggest auto show I’ve ever been to,” said Kang, 52, of Los Angeles, who has directed his own racing film, “Drifter,” which does not yet have a release date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kang said he learned about Chicago’s car culture while filming an episode of his Insight TV reality show, “The Ride Life,” in the city a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chicago is awesome because it's very diverse,” he said. “There's such a mixture of different ethnic groups.The car culture is not just one color.

You can just sit for hours in the garage thinking, ‘What should I do next? When's the next event?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Ryan Rivera, another contest finalist, learned how to build cars from his father, who worked in a body shop in Puerto Rico as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-340000\" name=\"image-340000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4d69312/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5089x2856+0+268/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fba%2F28%2F45025fb049ecb2fce3c6a1c1caab%2Fautoshow-260208-05.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5407f5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5089x2856+0+268/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fba%2F28%2F45025fb049ecb2fce3c6a1c1caab%2Fautoshow-260208-05.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2ab212f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5089x2856+0+268/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fba%2F28%2F45025fb049ecb2fce3c6a1c1caab%2Fautoshow-260208-05.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Ryan Rivera stands next to his Acura Integra Type-S.

For example, the Chicago Auto Show’s social media is managed by Capture Company, a Chicago-based marketing firm owned by 21-year-old college student Marcel Sutkowski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a teenager taking pictures of cars at the event, Sutkowski said he was inspired by the culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/transportation/2026/02/07/drivers-license-reinstatement-expo-courts-transportation\"   &gt;Teams of lawyers put drivers back on the road by reinstating suspended licenses&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/art/2025/10/12/slow-and-low-lowrider-festival-navy-pier-cars-bikes-chicano-culture\"   &gt;Lowrider festival showcases Latino car culture and artistry at Navy Pier&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment-culture/2025/08/30/slaughterhouse-31-vespa-scooter-rally\"   &gt;Photos: Vespa enthusiasts show off their personality and style during annual Chicago rally&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“The auto show brings so many people together, and it's just an incredible time,” said Sutkowski, who grew up in the northwest suburbs and now attends Purdue University. “Look how many families are here.

Her license was first suspended in 2014 when she got a ticket for driving without insurance. Since then, she's accumulated additional violations, including for failure to appear in court and other minor traffic tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a valid license, Caldwell says she has been spending nearly $80 a day on Uber rides to get herself and her children to work and school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m crying tears of joy because I’ve waited years to get my license back,” Caldwell said. “I’m racking up more debt than I’m able to pay working one job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Driver’s License Reinstatement Expo provides Cook County residents with free legal assistance to help restore suspended or revoked Illinois driver’s licenses. Saturday's event was hosted by the Pilsen Neighbors Community Council at Malcolm X College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event partners with the Illinois Secretary of State’s office, the Cook County public defender’s office, judges, and pro bono attorneys to create a one-stop shop for residents seeking relief. Nearly 500 people registered to attend, and there were many other walk-ins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expo founder Alex Garcia said the event is held annually during Black History Month and Hispanic Heritage Month to support Black and Brown communities that are disproportionately impacted by license suspensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-940000\" name=\"image-940000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aa8a46c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9b%2Fa9%2Fa837eee147ca9cb950d4b2744510%2Fdsc01136.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/74a9d7b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9b%2Fa9%2Fa837eee147ca9cb950d4b2744510%2Fdsc01136.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e52a5b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9b%2Fa9%2Fa837eee147ca9cb950d4b2744510%2Fdsc01136.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Alex Garcia, founder of the Driver’s License Reinstatement Expo, said the continued need for the event highlights how license suspensions disproportionately impact people of color. “We are glad to continue doing these expos,” Garcia said, “but we hope elected officials change policies so there won’t be a need to host them in the future.” Somer Van Benton/WBEZ\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e52a5b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9b%2Fa9%2Fa837eee147ca9cb950d4b2744510%2Fdsc01136.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6646d2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9b%2Fa9%2Fa837eee147ca9cb950d4b2744510%2Fdsc01136.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e52a5b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9b%2Fa9%2Fa837eee147ca9cb950d4b2744510%2Fdsc01136.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Garcia, founder of the Driver’s License Reinstatement Expo, says Pilsen Neighbors Community Council has been advocating for local and state policy changes to prevent certain moving violations from resulting in licenses being suspended or revoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somer Van Benton/WBEZ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public transportation is an option.

He does it with his passing, his screening, just a level of unselfishness, and the way he plays the game is impressive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donovan and his new-look squad got to see that up close, especially in the fourth quarter. Jokic was a plus-19 in that quarter alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the new Bulls, &lt;b&gt;Collin Sexton&lt;/b&gt; had 17 points, &lt;b&gt;Nick Richards&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Anfernee Simons&lt;/b&gt; each had 15 points, &lt;b&gt;Guerschon Yabusele&lt;/b&gt; scored 12, &lt;b&gt;Jaden Ivey&lt;/b&gt; had 10 points and &lt;b&gt;Rob Dillingham&lt;/b&gt; scored nine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matas Buzelis&lt;/b&gt; led the Bulls with 21 points and grabbed eight rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The defense was not good [in the fourth quarter],” Donovan said. “We’re going to make some mistakes. The guys are all playing together; guys are forgetting plays; the spacing may not [be there]. It’s going to happen, but we’ve got to get much, much better defensively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ivey league&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivey said it was quite some time since he put in a 33-minute shift, which he did in his Bulls debut in Toronto on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It actually took place Dec. 26, 2024, while he was still a regular in the Pistons’ starting lineup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No wonder Ivey was admittedly feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obviously, it’s taxing on my body, but, shoot, so is basketball in general,” Ivey said. “I checked the stat sheet as far as my minutes, and 33 minutes was probably the longest I’ve played in a while.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about his approach in figuring out how to play with all of his new teammates, he said it feels like a pickup game at the local gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I mean, yeah, you ask anybody that gets traded, nobody just comes in and, ‘Man, we got it down pat,’ ’’ Ivey said. “You gotta kind of figure it out, and it takes time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A different view&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bulls executive vice president &lt;b&gt;Arturas Karnisovas&lt;/b&gt; admittedly took a lot out of the 15-5 run at the end of the 2024-25 regular season, but he might’ve put too much stock in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donovan was asked about the approach to the rest of this season and made it clear that he looks at things differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The thing that stood out to me more than anything else was the Miami [play-in] game,” Donovan said. “The 15-5, because it was the end of the year, was such a mixed bag of teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘When there was a meaningful game, like a Game 7, so to speak, we got really dominated in that game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I looked at it from the lens of we’ve got a lot of growth yet to get better and a lot of that was, ‘Hey, we’ve got to get more physical.’ ’’&lt;/p&gt;",

The Patriots, meanwhile, want to finally move forward from the departures of coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady as Mike Vrabel and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/01/25/bears-patriots-seahawks-super-bowl-drake-maye-caleb-williams-quarterback-draft-class-2024-sunday-nfl-afc-nfc-championships\"   &gt;Drake Maye&lt;/a&gt; step into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady leaving in 2020 was unpleasant for all parties and sent the Patriots spiraling. Belichick managed one winning season without him and was gone four years later. Successor Jerod Mayo couldn’t measure up, and neither could 2021 first-round pick Mac Jones at quarterback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After back-to-back 4-13 seasons, the Patriots reached into their past to find their future. Vrabel, a three-time champion linebacker from the Belichick years, was exactly what Maye, and the team at large, needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Super Bowl week has been a clear demarcation between where the Patriots were and where they’re headed. Not only are they playing for what would be a record-setting seventh championship, but Vrabel was awarded Coach of the Year and Maye finished a very close second for MVP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That combination was essential in the Patriots finishing top five in scoring offense and defense for first time since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Seahawks it wasn’t so much a problem with coach Pete Carroll’s approach, but rather that they needed a fresh voice after three middling seasons and with Carroll in his 70s. Coach Mike McDonald credited Carroll for laying the foundation for what he’s done the last two seasons, and like Carroll, he’s a defensive minded coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Seahawks have no desire to push Legion of Boom deeper into their past. It’s more so a standard they’re trying to reach. The stars of that group still come around quite a bit, and Seahawks safety Julian Love said the defense talks with former four-time Pro Bowl safety Kam Chancellor weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They give us our flowers and vice versa,” safety Coby Bryant said. “We appreciate those guys coming around. They’ve been a huge help since I stepped into the league.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I modeled my game after a lot of those guys growing up. They always flew around and made plays, and that was something I saw myself doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ve looked like the new version of Legion of Boom, and just like that group, allowed the fewest points in the league this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legacies have raised the stakes for both teams as the Seahawks try to live up to theirs and the Patriots are out to write a new one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When the Seahawks have the ball&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/06/ridiculed-and-doubted-for-years-seahawks-qb-sam-darnold-declines-to-gloat-at-super-bowl-lx\"   &gt;take quarterback Sam Darnold seriously&lt;/a&gt;. He deserved that respect last season with the Vikings, really, but now it can’t even be argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six seasons adrift, mainly with the lowly Jets and Panthers, he has gone 30-7 as a starter the last two seasons, including the playoffs. In that span, he posted a 101.1 passer rating, threw 65 touchdown passes and 27 interceptions and averaged 245.5 yards per game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not a “system quarterback” or someone quietly riding a great defense to victories. That’s a winner. Maybe the Jets and the Panthers were the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darnold followed his excellent regular season with two monster playoff games as the Sea-hawks scored a total of 72 points to beat the Rams and 49ers. He’s as much the reason they’re in the Super Bowl as anyone else on the roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s been everything you would want in a quarterback,” All-Pro wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba said. “We all love Sam and believe in him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Patriots were eighth in total defense this season, but they faced a lot of bad quarterbacks and still allowed the 12th-highest passer rating in the regular season. They also had the ninth-lowest pressure rate, and Darnold is protected by a top-10 offensive line, meaning he’ll have time to find weapons such as Smith-Njigba, Cooper Kupp and AJ Barner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When the Patriots have the ball&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterback Drake Maye had an MVP-caliber season, but the Patriots are unlikely to win without their ground game rolling. That starts with rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henderson went 38th overall in the draft last year, 32 spots behind coveted star Ashton Jeanty, but had just as good of a rookie season as Jeanty. Henderson finished second in the draft class to Jeanty’s 975 yards rushing with 911, though his 5.1 yards per carry blew away Jeanty’s 3.7, and led it with nine touchdown runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears had their eyes on him in the draft but were sitting 39th. When the Patriots picked Henderson, the Bears picked wide receiver Luther Burden, and it worked out for all parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henderson was mostly a non-factor, though, in the Patriots’ win over the Broncos in the AFC Championship Game. Weather played a big role in the game as heavy snow made everything difficult, but the Patriots managed just 10 points and Henderson ran three times for five yards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They got far more production from Rhamondre Stevenson with 71 yards on 25 carries, and they’ll need both of them to step up if they’re going to make headway against a Seahawks defense that ranked third against the run in the regular season and shut down the Rams’ rushing attack in the NFC Championship Game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henderson called this the longest season of his life — he’s about to play his 21st game — and fatigue could be hitting him. He was under four yards per carry in each of his last three games and totaled just 195 yards over his last six.&lt;/p&gt;",

Friends and family have already begun to mention the upcoming milestone. While I politely acknowledge the event, I hide my indifference. You see, my wife has always been a serial cheater. It's a secret I have kept from everyone, especially our children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because she has always been a wonderful mother, I would never do anything to tarnish their love and appreciation of her. The children are a large part of the reason I have remained married. Aside from her betrayal, she has been a good wife and companion, and I still love her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her affairs, I fought depression by submerging myself in work and crying when alone. Our children are grown and on their own now. We have a beautiful grandson. We both retired a couple of years ago, and that is when the reality of the past 40 years hit me. I no longer have the crutch of work to help me through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our marriage has been sexless since she went through menopause 15 years ago. I have been loyal to her all these years, but I still desire intimacy. I have a few female friends who, in the past, have shown an interest in more intimate relationships. Would it be wrong to rekindle and move forward with an old friend? I have no intention of leaving my wife, but I am so in need of something more. — &lt;i&gt;FORTY YEARS A FOOL&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR 'FOOL':&lt;/b&gt; Have you actually TALKED to your wife (whom you love) about this? Many postmenopausal women whose libidos have declined still enjoy sex. This is a subject she should have discussed with her gynecologist 15 years ago because this is not an insurmountable problem. If she refuses, you would be within your rights to tell her you want the same dispensation you have given her for 40 years of infidelity, because you still need and desire intimacy. Her response will tell you everything you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; I have been eating dessert on days I have deemed \"dessert-free.\" I get to have dessert on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Can you please help me to stop my struggle on the days when I don't get dessert? — &lt;i&gt;CRAVING IT IN WASHINGTON&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR CRAVING IT:&lt;/b&gt; I understand (only too well!) the mindset that a meal isn't complete unless there's something sweet at the end of the main course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, a psychologist friend shared with me that she resolved her craving for something sweet by carrying a small bag containing a ginger snap cookie in her purse when she went to restaurants. When she was finished with her meal, she took the bag out of her purse and ate HALF of one. She said it satisfied her craving without sabotaging her diet. Try it. However, if it doesn't work for you, consider substituting a piece of fresh fruit for the cookie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.
