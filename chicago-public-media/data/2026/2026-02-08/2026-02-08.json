The boy was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preliminary autopsy findings indicated the boy suffered from malnourishment and physical abuse, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The boy’s 10-year-old brother was hospitalized after speaking with the Lake County Children's Advocacy Center, which determined he also showed signs of abuse and malnourishment. Their step-sibling, a 3-year-old boy, also lived at the home and was placed in the care of the state Department of Children and Family Services, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children’s mother, Dominique Servant, 33, and her boyfriend, Joey Ruffin, 38, were taken into custody Friday night, police said. Both are charged with two counts of first-degree murder and one count of child endangerment causing death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities are attempting to contact the children's biological father, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Servant and Ruffin are due in court Sunday morning.&lt;/p&gt;",

Another important evaluation test for a front office that has more fails than passes in that department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adding four guards in the week leading up to the Feb. 5 trade deadline, the Bulls gave themselves a runway of 30 games – including Saturday’s – to evaluate Simons, Collin Sexton, Rob Dillingham and Jaden Ivey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simons and Sexton are in the final years of their current contracts and will become unrestricted free agents, while Ivey will be a restricted free agent. Dillingham is on his rookie contract but considering how poorly things were going in Minnesota for him, the Bulls need to find out why and was it fixable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not an ideal situation for the team to be in considering they are in a rebuild – or as executive vice president of basketball operations Arturas Karnisovas says, a new “stage – and every decision has consequences that help the seed grow or kill it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the day I tell myself, ‘Hey, just be where the feet are at,’ “ Sexton said of his approach to the rest of the season. “Don’t look too far in advance and when I’m doing that I feel like I’m at my best. Just give it my all for this organization, give my all to this team, show them what I can do. I just know that’s something I can control. Each and every day coming in with the right energy. Being a true professional is something I can control and the rest will take care of itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where coach Billy Donovan comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karnisovas and general manager Marc Eversley can watch the basketball part of their new guard room, but it’s Donovan that will be with the players on an almost daily basis between now and mid-April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For me a lot of it comes down to the way I look at from the lens of the mentality piece,” Donovan said on Saturday. “That’s kind of what I’m looking at. To me it’s more of the competitiveness, the mentality, how are they in the locker room, how are they as teammates, can they follow game-plan discipline, all those types of things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donovan admitted that he had a meeting with the front office on Friday to figure out playing time and if they had an edict on a minutes priority. After all, it would make sense to see more of Dillingham and Ivey since they are more likely to be kept, but Donovan said there was none of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think at least the feeling from the front office was they wanted to see kind of all these guys that are in here right now,” Donovan said. “It hasn’t been, ‘Hey, we want you to play this guy, this guy.’ They want these guys to go out and compete, see how well they can fit in to how we’ve been trying to play.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music to Dillingham’s ears, who was begging for a new start after a season-and-a-half with the Timberwolves and diminishing minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Job interview? For the second-year guard it almost feels like a career change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m just trying to show I can play basketball, I belong here and I can help the team win,” Dillingham said. “I’m not looking at it as something specific.”&lt;/p&gt;",

The &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/super-25-basketball-rankings/2026/02/01/high-school-basketball-rankings-chicago-illinois-sun-times-michael-obrien\"   &gt;No. 20 Dukes&lt;/a&gt; pack the paint with three big, wide, strong and smart football players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunter Stepanich, a 6-7 tight end, is heading to Princeton. Georgetown Costa Kampas is a 6-5, 275-pound powerhouse offensive tackle, and 6-4 Jackson Rennick is a lineman heading to Wisconsin-Whitewater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We know we are probably one of the most physical teams in the state and one of the best rebounding teams, so we play to our strengths,\" Stepanich said. \"Our defense is the trademark of the team. The guys are all getting up and pressuring because when someone gets through there is me, Costa and Jackson. We can clean up down low and cover the corners. Our defense makes people uncomfortable, and we capitalize on that.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;York held host Libertyville without a field goal in the third quarter on &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/high-school-basketball/scores/2026/02/07/chicago-high-school-basketball-scores-illinois\"   &gt;Saturday&lt;/a&gt; and went on to win 47-41.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dukes (24-4) have used their size and bulk to become the area's most surprisingly successful team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If you would have told us we'd be 24-4 right now we would have said you are crazy,\" York coach Mike Dunn said. \"But our kids believe and there is a great bond on the team. They like each other and they hang out with each other outside of basketball. That makes things a lot easier.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Junior Joseph Ubbe led the Dukes with 17 points and Stepanich added 12 points and seven rebounds. Stepanich was matched up against Libertyville's 6-9 Bryce Wegrzyn in a rare big-man battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I've played against him a few times and he's a great player,\" Stepanich said. \"I've seen him get better and better the past few years and I was excited for this game. There aren't many big man battles, so it is always a good time when one comes around.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wegrzyn, a Winona State recruit, hurt his eye early in the second half and finished with 10 points. He tried to play through it for a while, but spent most of the fourth quarter on the bench.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"His vision was blurry and I didn't see any point in risking anything,\" Libertyville coach Brian Zyrkowski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior guard Trevor Wallace led the Wildcats (14-9) with 12 points. Libertyville trailed by 12 points with 6:32 left but made three three-pointers to tighten things up. A three from Ben Kristopher with 34 seconds left cut the deficit to 46-41 but that was as close it would get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;York's football team has made deep playoff runs the past several years, but that wasn't the case this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I do think it impacted the team,\" Kampas said. \"The brotherhood this year is really special. And being with the team for 2 to 3 weeks longer made a difference. This is an incredibly close-knit group.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-d40000\" name=\"image-d40000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a8d0c8c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6940x3895+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F36%2F22%2F5b826ab1457485e1c83d428cd993%2Fob-cst-020826-007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/196d303/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6940x3895+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F36%2F22%2F5b826ab1457485e1c83d428cd993%2Fob-cst-020826-007.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ebfe312/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6940x3895+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F36%2F22%2F5b826ab1457485e1c83d428cd993%2Fob-cst-020826-007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"York’s Jackson Rennick (52) chest bumps Joseph Lubbe (25) during the game against Libertyville.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ebfe312/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6940x3895+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F36%2F22%2F5b826ab1457485e1c83d428cd993%2Fob-cst-020826-007.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4a04384/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6940x3895+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F36%2F22%2F5b826ab1457485e1c83d428cd993%2Fob-cst-020826-007.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ebfe312/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6940x3895+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F36%2F22%2F5b826ab1457485e1c83d428cd993%2Fob-cst-020826-007.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;York’s Jackson Rennick (52) chest bumps Joseph Lubbe (25) during the game against Libertyville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirsten Stickney/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;York's coaching staff has been surprised by the team's success, but the senior leaders had this in mind all along.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This was our opportunity to step up and lead as a senior class, and we always knew we would be ready,\" Stepanich said. \"And our coaches put us in a great position to make it happen.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"This is awesome, playing with some friends I've known since I was 5 years old and having this success,\" Kampas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dukes won ten consecutive games before losing to Lyons on Tuesday.

[The culture] is very strong, but hidden.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-580000\" name=\"image-580000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/de77d2b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4950x2778+0+261/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1b%2F0d%2F109417fb4b7fb5f7829b693bb26e%2Fautoshow-260208-04.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1544ff1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4950x2778+0+261/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1b%2F0d%2F109417fb4b7fb5f7829b693bb26e%2Fautoshow-260208-04.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72638c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4950x2778+0+261/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1b%2F0d%2F109417fb4b7fb5f7829b693bb26e%2Fautoshow-260208-04.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Matt Conger with his Toyota MR2. “I am so humbled,” Conger said of being selected to be among the inaugural group of cars chosen for the first Chi-Town Alley display.  \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72638c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4950x2778+0+261/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1b%2F0d%2F109417fb4b7fb5f7829b693bb26e%2Fautoshow-260208-04.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1bf1740/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4950x2778+0+261/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1b%2F0d%2F109417fb4b7fb5f7829b693bb26e%2Fautoshow-260208-04.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72638c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4950x2778+0+261/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F1b%2F0d%2F109417fb4b7fb5f7829b693bb26e%2Fautoshow-260208-04.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Conger with his Toyota MR2. “I am so humbled,” Conger said of being selected to be among the Chi-Town Alley Showcase finalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Giacomo Cain/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-310000\" name=\"module-310000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chicago Auto Show&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;When:&lt;/b&gt; Through Feb. 16&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt; McCormick Place, 2301 S.

They also participated in a meet and greet with “Fast &amp;amp; Furious” franchise actor Sung Kang, who made an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the biggest auto show I’ve ever been to,” said Kang, 52, of Los Angeles, who has directed his own racing film, “Drifter,” which does not yet have a release date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kang said he learned about Chicago’s car culture while filming an episode of his Insight TV reality show, “The Ride Life,” in the city a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chicago is awesome because it's very diverse,” he said. “There's such a mixture of different ethnic groups.The car culture is not just one color.

You can just sit for hours in the garage thinking, ‘What should I do next? When's the next event?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Ryan Rivera, another contest finalist, learned how to build cars from his father, who worked in a body shop in Puerto Rico as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-340000\" name=\"image-340000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4d69312/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5089x2856+0+268/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fba%2F28%2F45025fb049ecb2fce3c6a1c1caab%2Fautoshow-260208-05.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5407f5f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5089x2856+0+268/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fba%2F28%2F45025fb049ecb2fce3c6a1c1caab%2Fautoshow-260208-05.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2ab212f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5089x2856+0+268/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fba%2F28%2F45025fb049ecb2fce3c6a1c1caab%2Fautoshow-260208-05.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Ryan Rivera stands next to his Acura Integra Type-S.

For example, the Chicago Auto Show’s social media is managed by Capture Company, a Chicago-based marketing firm owned by 21-year-old college student Marcel Sutkowski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a teenager taking pictures of cars at the event, Sutkowski said he was inspired by the culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/transportation/2026/02/07/drivers-license-reinstatement-expo-courts-transportation\"   &gt;Teams of lawyers put drivers back on the road by reinstating suspended licenses&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/art/2025/10/12/slow-and-low-lowrider-festival-navy-pier-cars-bikes-chicano-culture\"   &gt;Lowrider festival showcases Latino car culture and artistry at Navy Pier&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment-culture/2025/08/30/slaughterhouse-31-vespa-scooter-rally\"   &gt;Photos: Vespa enthusiasts show off their personality and style during annual Chicago rally&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n        &lt;/ul&gt;\n    \n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“The auto show brings so many people together, and it's just an incredible time,” said Sutkowski, who grew up in the northwest suburbs and now attends Purdue University. “Look how many families are here.

Her license was first suspended in 2014 when she got a ticket for driving without insurance. Since then, she's accumulated additional violations, including for failure to appear in court and other minor traffic tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a valid license, Caldwell says she has been spending nearly $80 a day on Uber rides to get herself and her children to work and school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m crying tears of joy because I’ve waited years to get my license back,” Caldwell said. “I’m racking up more debt than I’m able to pay working one job.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Driver’s License Reinstatement Expo provides Cook County residents with free legal assistance to help restore suspended or revoked Illinois driver’s licenses. Saturday's event was hosted by the Pilsen Neighbors Community Council at Malcolm X College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event partners with the Illinois Secretary of State’s office, the Cook County public defender’s office, judges, and pro bono attorneys to create a one-stop shop for residents seeking relief. Nearly 500 people registered to attend, and there were many other walk-ins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expo founder Alex Garcia said the event is held annually during Black History Month and Hispanic Heritage Month to support Black and Brown communities that are disproportionately impacted by license suspensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-940000\" name=\"image-940000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aa8a46c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9b%2Fa9%2Fa837eee147ca9cb950d4b2744510%2Fdsc01136.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/74a9d7b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9b%2Fa9%2Fa837eee147ca9cb950d4b2744510%2Fdsc01136.JPG 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e52a5b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9b%2Fa9%2Fa837eee147ca9cb950d4b2744510%2Fdsc01136.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Alex Garcia, founder of the Driver’s License Reinstatement Expo, said the continued need for the event highlights how license suspensions disproportionately impact people of color. “We are glad to continue doing these expos,” Garcia said, “but we hope elected officials change policies so there won’t be a need to host them in the future.” Somer Van Benton/WBEZ\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e52a5b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9b%2Fa9%2Fa837eee147ca9cb950d4b2744510%2Fdsc01136.JPG 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6646d2e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9b%2Fa9%2Fa837eee147ca9cb950d4b2744510%2Fdsc01136.JPG 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e52a5b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3367+0+316/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F9b%2Fa9%2Fa837eee147ca9cb950d4b2744510%2Fdsc01136.JPG\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Garcia, founder of the Driver’s License Reinstatement Expo, says Pilsen Neighbors Community Council has been advocating for local and state policy changes to prevent certain moving violations from resulting in licenses being suspended or revoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somer Van Benton/WBEZ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public transportation is an option.

He does it with his passing, his screening, just a level of unselfishness, and the way he plays the game is impressive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donovan and his new-look squad got to see that up close, especially in the fourth quarter. Jokic was a plus-19 in that quarter alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the new Bulls, &lt;b&gt;Collin Sexton&lt;/b&gt; had 17 points, &lt;b&gt;Nick Richards&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Anfernee Simons&lt;/b&gt; each had 15 points, &lt;b&gt;Guerschon Yabusele&lt;/b&gt; scored 12, &lt;b&gt;Jaden Ivey&lt;/b&gt; had 10 points and &lt;b&gt;Rob Dillingham&lt;/b&gt; scored nine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Matas Buzelis&lt;/b&gt; led the Bulls with 21 points and grabbed eight rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The defense was not good [in the fourth quarter],” Donovan said. “We’re going to make some mistakes. The guys are all playing together; guys are forgetting plays; the spacing may not [be there]. It’s going to happen, but we’ve got to get much, much better defensively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ivey league&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ivey said it was quite some time since he put in a 33-minute shift, which he did in his Bulls debut in Toronto on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It actually took place Dec. 26, 2024, while he was still a regular in the Pistons’ starting lineup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No wonder Ivey was admittedly feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obviously, it’s taxing on my body, but, shoot, so is basketball in general,” Ivey said. “I checked the stat sheet as far as my minutes, and 33 minutes was probably the longest I’ve played in a while.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about his approach in figuring out how to play with all of his new teammates, he said it feels like a pickup game at the local gym.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I mean, yeah, you ask anybody that gets traded, nobody just comes in and, ‘Man, we got it down pat,’ ’’ Ivey said. “You gotta kind of figure it out, and it takes time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A different view&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bulls executive vice president &lt;b&gt;Arturas Karnisovas&lt;/b&gt; admittedly took a lot out of the 15-5 run at the end of the 2024-25 regular season, but he might’ve put too much stock in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donovan was asked about the approach to the rest of this season and made it clear that he looks at things differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The thing that stood out to me more than anything else was the Miami [play-in] game,” Donovan said. “The 15-5, because it was the end of the year, was such a mixed bag of teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘‘When there was a meaningful game, like a Game 7, so to speak, we got really dominated in that game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I looked at it from the lens of we’ve got a lot of growth yet to get better and a lot of that was, ‘Hey, we’ve got to get more physical.’ ’’&lt;/p&gt;",

The Patriots, meanwhile, want to finally move forward from the departures of coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady as Mike Vrabel and &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/01/25/bears-patriots-seahawks-super-bowl-drake-maye-caleb-williams-quarterback-draft-class-2024-sunday-nfl-afc-nfc-championships\"   &gt;Drake Maye&lt;/a&gt; step into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady leaving in 2020 was unpleasant for all parties and sent the Patriots spiraling. Belichick managed one winning season without him and was gone four years later. Successor Jerod Mayo couldn’t measure up, and neither could 2021 first-round pick Mac Jones at quarterback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After back-to-back 4-13 seasons, the Patriots reached into their past to find their future. Vrabel, a three-time champion linebacker from the Belichick years, was exactly what Maye, and the team at large, needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Super Bowl week has been a clear demarcation between where the Patriots were and where they’re headed. Not only are they playing for what would be a record-setting seventh championship, but Vrabel was awarded Coach of the Year and Maye finished a very close second for MVP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That combination was essential in the Patriots finishing top five in scoring offense and defense for first time since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Seahawks it wasn’t so much a problem with coach Pete Carroll’s approach, but rather that they needed a fresh voice after three middling seasons and with Carroll in his 70s. Coach Mike McDonald credited Carroll for laying the foundation for what he’s done the last two seasons, and like Carroll, he’s a defensive minded coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Seahawks have no desire to push Legion of Boom deeper into their past. It’s more so a standard they’re trying to reach. The stars of that group still come around quite a bit, and Seahawks safety Julian Love said the defense talks with former four-time Pro Bowl safety Kam Chancellor weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They give us our flowers and vice versa,” safety Coby Bryant said. “We appreciate those guys coming around. They’ve been a huge help since I stepped into the league.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I modeled my game after a lot of those guys growing up. They always flew around and made plays, and that was something I saw myself doing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ve looked like the new version of Legion of Boom, and just like that group, allowed the fewest points in the league this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legacies have raised the stakes for both teams as the Seahawks try to live up to theirs and the Patriots are out to write a new one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When the Seahawks have the ball&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/06/ridiculed-and-doubted-for-years-seahawks-qb-sam-darnold-declines-to-gloat-at-super-bowl-lx\"   &gt;take quarterback Sam Darnold seriously&lt;/a&gt;. He deserved that respect last season with the Vikings, really, but now it can’t even be argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six seasons adrift, mainly with the lowly Jets and Panthers, he has gone 30-7 as a starter the last two seasons, including the playoffs. In that span, he posted a 101.1 passer rating, threw 65 touchdown passes and 27 interceptions and averaged 245.5 yards per game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s not a “system quarterback” or someone quietly riding a great defense to victories. That’s a winner. Maybe the Jets and the Panthers were the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darnold followed his excellent regular season with two monster playoff games as the Sea-hawks scored a total of 72 points to beat the Rams and 49ers. He’s as much the reason they’re in the Super Bowl as anyone else on the roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He’s been everything you would want in a quarterback,” All-Pro wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba said. “We all love Sam and believe in him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Patriots were eighth in total defense this season, but they faced a lot of bad quarterbacks and still allowed the 12th-highest passer rating in the regular season. They also had the ninth-lowest pressure rate, and Darnold is protected by a top-10 offensive line, meaning he’ll have time to find weapons such as Smith-Njigba, Cooper Kupp and AJ Barner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;When the Patriots have the ball&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterback Drake Maye had an MVP-caliber season, but the Patriots are unlikely to win without their ground game rolling. That starts with rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henderson went 38th overall in the draft last year, 32 spots behind coveted star Ashton Jeanty, but had just as good of a rookie season as Jeanty. Henderson finished second in the draft class to Jeanty’s 975 yards rushing with 911, though his 5.1 yards per carry blew away Jeanty’s 3.7, and led it with nine touchdown runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears had their eyes on him in the draft but were sitting 39th. When the Patriots picked Henderson, the Bears picked wide receiver Luther Burden, and it worked out for all parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henderson was mostly a non-factor, though, in the Patriots’ win over the Broncos in the AFC Championship Game. Weather played a big role in the game as heavy snow made everything difficult, but the Patriots managed just 10 points and Henderson ran three times for five yards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They got far more production from Rhamondre Stevenson with 71 yards on 25 carries, and they’ll need both of them to step up if they’re going to make headway against a Seahawks defense that ranked third against the run in the regular season and shut down the Rams’ rushing attack in the NFC Championship Game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Henderson called this the longest season of his life — he’s about to play his 21st game — and fatigue could be hitting him. He was under four yards per carry in each of his last three games and totaled just 195 yards over his last six.&lt;/p&gt;",

Friends and family have already begun to mention the upcoming milestone. While I politely acknowledge the event, I hide my indifference. You see, my wife has always been a serial cheater. It's a secret I have kept from everyone, especially our children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because she has always been a wonderful mother, I would never do anything to tarnish their love and appreciation of her. The children are a large part of the reason I have remained married. Aside from her betrayal, she has been a good wife and companion, and I still love her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her affairs, I fought depression by submerging myself in work and crying when alone. Our children are grown and on their own now. We have a beautiful grandson. We both retired a couple of years ago, and that is when the reality of the past 40 years hit me. I no longer have the crutch of work to help me through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our marriage has been sexless since she went through menopause 15 years ago. I have been loyal to her all these years, but I still desire intimacy. I have a few female friends who, in the past, have shown an interest in more intimate relationships. Would it be wrong to rekindle and move forward with an old friend? I have no intention of leaving my wife, but I am so in need of something more. — &lt;i&gt;FORTY YEARS A FOOL&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR 'FOOL':&lt;/b&gt; Have you actually TALKED to your wife (whom you love) about this? Many postmenopausal women whose libidos have declined still enjoy sex. This is a subject she should have discussed with her gynecologist 15 years ago because this is not an insurmountable problem. If she refuses, you would be within your rights to tell her you want the same dispensation you have given her for 40 years of infidelity, because you still need and desire intimacy. Her response will tell you everything you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; I have been eating dessert on days I have deemed \"dessert-free.\" I get to have dessert on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Can you please help me to stop my struggle on the days when I don't get dessert? — &lt;i&gt;CRAVING IT IN WASHINGTON&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR CRAVING IT:&lt;/b&gt; I understand (only too well!) the mindset that a meal isn't complete unless there's something sweet at the end of the main course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, a psychologist friend shared with me that she resolved her craving for something sweet by carrying a small bag containing a ginger snap cookie in her purse when she went to restaurants. When she was finished with her meal, she took the bag out of her purse and ate HALF of one. She said it satisfied her craving without sabotaging her diet. Try it. However, if it doesn't work for you, consider substituting a piece of fresh fruit for the cookie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

That's in spite of losing nine of their last 12 entering the now-ongoing Olympic break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While players relax on beaches across the continent and await the season's resumption Feb. 26, here's an examination of the Hawks' most encouraging and discouraging&amp;nbsp;trends so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encouraging: Bedard’s breakout&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connor Bedard's injury and somewhat slow post-injury return to top form has distracted fans from the fact Bedard has still taken a huge step forward this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 53 points in 44 games, he's averaging 1.2 points per game, up from 0.9 and 0.82 in his first two seasons. If not for his injury, he would be on pace to reach nearly 100 points. His defensive work ethic has also increased substantially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no doubt Bedard has &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2025/10/29/connor-bedard-blackhawks-voice-honest-kings-boring-macklin-celebrini\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;become&lt;/a&gt; the superstar everyone expected him to become when the Hawks drafted him — even if San Jose's Macklin Celebrini's even faster road to superstardom has also distracted fans from the impressiveness of that fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks don't have to worry about finding their next franchise cornerstone —&amp;nbsp;because they have that guy already. That's something very few other NHL franchises can claim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price tag of Bedard's new contract this summer will be interesting, but the Hawks can easily afford any number. Locking him up long-term is a matter of when, not if.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Three-game goal streak for Connor Bedard, and five points in his last 4 games:&lt;a href=\"https://t.co/DaBRyXrCgG\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DaBRyXrCgG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ben Pope (@BenPopeCST) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenPopeCST/status/2018502650140959137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 3, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discouraging: No star ‘D’ yet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks hope either Artyom Levshunov or Sam Rinzel will eventually emerge as a No. 1 defenseman. Neither has done so yet, though, even though they still have plenty of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levshunov enjoyed the best stretch of his career around New Year's, but then his game fell off a cliff, leading to his removal from the lineup for a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/01/30/blackhawks-artyom-levshunov-reset-break-foundational-skills-jeff-blashill\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;fundamental reset&lt;/a&gt;. Rinzel hasn't replicated his excellence from last spring, although he has &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/2026/02/03/blackhawks-sam-rinzel-brainpower-weight-strength-zach-werenski-artyom-levshunov\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;looked better&lt;/a&gt; (in a small sample) since his recent call-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the AHL, too, Kevin Korchinski hasn't demonstrated he's made a substantial leap forward in terms of on-ice ability, even though his mindset has &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2025/11/19/blackhawks-prospect-kevin-korchinski-rockford-icehogs-development-ahl-nhl\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;matured&lt;/a&gt;. That means none of the Hawks' top three defensive prospects are exceeding expectations this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encouraging: Crevier, Kaiser’s growth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Louis Crevier and Wyatt Kaiser have evolved from depth defensemen of debatable relevance within the rebuild into trustworthy top-four defensemen who deserve to stick around long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser's quick brain and quick feet have earned &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2025/11/05/blackhawks-wyatt-kaiser-defensive-stalwart-duncan-keith-nhl\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;comparisons&lt;/a&gt; to a young Duncan Keith and provided the glue holding the Hawks' defense together. He extinguishes fires defensively and makes things happen in transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crevier, meanwhile, continues to smash through assumptions about his ceiling. His size and reach make him reliable defensively, and his strength gives him the Hawks' hardest shot, but he has &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/01/12/blackhawks-louis-crevier-complete-player-offensive-growth-shooting-alex-vlasic\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;rounded out&lt;/a&gt; his game with improved skating and passing this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discouraging: Poor analytics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks had the worst cumulative five-on-five scoring-chance ratio in the NHL over the last three seasons combined, and they have the worst scoring-chance ratio yet again this season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ratio has improved, from 41.9% previously to 44.6% this season. But it's still dead last, and that's certainly discouraging. The Hawks also rank last in expected-goals ratio (44.3%) and second-to-last in shot ratio (45.3%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coach Jeff Blashill has brought up some interesting shortcomings of public analytics models, clarifying that the Hawks' internal analytics model paints a slightly rosier picture of their performance — although nobody disputes the fact they have a ways to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encouraging: Blashill’s coaching&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blashill has brought time-tested authority to his role that his predecessors lacked. No offense to Jeremy Colliton or Luke Richardson, but Blashill exudes far more confidence and legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players have praised the efficiency and purposefulness of Blashill's practices and video sessions, mentioning how everything they spend time on eventually ties together in easy-to-follow and productive ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has the Hawks running relatively complex systems designed for a real contender, not for a bottom-feeder just trying to muck up games enough to earn some points. The penalty-killing system has especially paid dividends; the Hawks rank in No. 1 in that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans often over-analyze lineup construction and player deployment, but it feels like Blashill and his assistants —&amp;nbsp;especially defensive assistant Anders Sorensen —&amp;nbsp;have done a generally good job with that, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discouraging: Nazar’s slump&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Frank Nazar — fresh off signing a seven-year &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2025/08/21/blackhawks-frank-nazar-nhl-contract-extension-rebuild-core-piece\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;contract extension&lt;/a&gt; —&amp;nbsp;appeared to be making the leap everyone expected, racing out of the gates with swagger and scoring (11 points in his first 10 games).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, however, he has tallied only 13 points in 31 games —&amp;nbsp;and missed another 16 games with a broken jaw. That trend, combined with veteran forward Andre Burakovsky's own substantial dropoff after a promising autumn, has taken some punch out of the Hawks' top six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nazar will resume centering his own line after the Olympics, and the Hawks would love to see him find a rhythm again before the season ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-a60000\" name=\"image-a60000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/572312f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F85%2F14%2F1b2959864ca0bc770ff75e0eaf4d%2Fnazar.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a8b2e2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F85%2F14%2F1b2959864ca0bc770ff75e0eaf4d%2Fnazar.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/af78639/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F85%2F14%2F1b2959864ca0bc770ff75e0eaf4d%2Fnazar.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Frank Nazar\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/af78639/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F85%2F14%2F1b2959864ca0bc770ff75e0eaf4d%2Fnazar.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/da8696a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F85%2F14%2F1b2959864ca0bc770ff75e0eaf4d%2Fnazar.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/af78639/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1684+0+0/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F85%2F14%2F1b2959864ca0bc770ff75e0eaf4d%2Fnazar.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frank Nazar hasn’t been able to replicate his October hot streak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathan Denette/AP Photos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encouraging: Knight’s endurance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Hawk who has largely sustained his early-season success is Spencer Knight, their new franchise goalie. He did fall back to Earth after spending October on Mars, but his stats remain solid. His .908 save percentage ranks 15th among 65 goalies league-wide, and his plus-12.8 GSAA ranks eighth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His work last summer to prepare for a full-time starter's workload for the first time has paid off, too. He has proven he has &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2025/11/30/blackhawks-nhl-goalie-spencer-knight-off-ice-habits-red-light-mat\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; and staying power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discouraging: Top of the Central&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Avalanche, Wild and Stars —&amp;nbsp;owning three of the NHL's five best records —&amp;nbsp;have a stranglehold on the Central Division that doesn't seem likely to loosen anytime soon, even if the Hawks improve enough to challenge them for it a few years down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Avalanche set the standard for star forward/star defenseman combo that the Hawks hope to eventually match. If the Wild manage to extend Quinn Hughes, they will match it. And the Stars' skill for prospect development also sets a standard for the Hawks to try to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encouraging: Western mediocrity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is the rest of the Western Conference isn't intimidating whatsoever. The playoff cutoff line is on pace to be just 92 points this season, compared to 99 in the East. If that pattern repeats itself next season, the Hawks' road to contending for a wild-card spot wouldn't be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it doesn't seem like it will take long for the Hawks, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/01/31/blackhawks-sharks-rebuilds-connor-bedard-macklin-celebrini-mike-grier-kyle-davidson\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Sharks&lt;/a&gt; and Ducks —&amp;nbsp;the three up-and-coming teams loaded with young talent —&amp;nbsp;to surpass many of their relatively aimless peers.&lt;/p&gt;",

That would end a relatively short search after coordinator Declan Doyle left for the Ravens a little over a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any change at offensive coordinator is unlikely to be a significant issue for the Bears as they run Johnson’s offense and he is their play caller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor was the Jaguars’ offensive coordinator from 2022 through ’24 before joining Johnson’s staff last year. He also was a longtime assistant for the Eagles under coaches Chip Kelly and Doug Pederson and won a Super Bowl ring as assistant quarterbacks coach for them in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor said last season that Johnson set the agenda for coaching quarterback Caleb Williams, and quarterbacks coach J.T. Barrett handled the day-to-day details. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2025/08/13/ben-johnson-j-t-barrett-part-of-5-man-crew-working-to-get-caleb-williams-immersed-in-offense-by-week-1\"   &gt;He and Doyle would “chime in”&lt;/a&gt; during group discussions, Taylor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doyle was on the sideline and Taylor was up in the booth last season, and Johnson relied on them to “feed me the story” of what was working offensively, whether players were missing assignments and what the opponent’s defensive coverage tendencies were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor, 38, got his start in coaching as a graduate assistant at Tulsa after playing quarterback at Marshall. Kelly hired him as a low-level assistant in 2013, and he rose to quarterbacks coach for Carson Wentz under Pederson by 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Eagles cleaned house after the 2020 season, Taylor spent a season with the Colts before Pederson hired him as offensive coordinator for the Jaguars to work with Trevor Lawrence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Jaguars were seventh in scoring in Taylor’s first season, but slipped to 14th in 2023 and 25th in ’24 before they fired Pederson and his staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor’s older brother, Zac, is head coach of the Bengals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears needed to move relatively quickly as they progress in draft preparations and head to the NFL Scouting Combine in two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears don’t necessarily need to fill Taylor’s position, but it gives Johnson a chance to add an assistant. He already brought in new running backs coach Eric Studesville after Eric Bieniemy went back to the Chiefs as offensive coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;bsp-list-loadmore class=\"PageListH\" data-module data-hide-authors=\"true\" data-hide-categories=\"true\" data-hide-dates=\"true\" data-show-loadmore=\"true\"\n&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"list-bc0001\" name=\"list-bc0001\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=\"PageList-header\" &gt;\n    &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title-wrap\" &gt;\n        \n            &lt;div class=\"PageList-header-title\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;a class=\"\" href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears\" target=\"{borderColor=#dfdfdf, pageNumber=1, inverseColors=false, footerBgColor=#000000, bodyFont=font-3, showListNumbers=false, imagePositionHorizontal=null, rteBodyFont=font-3, headerBottomBorderColor=#111010, titleUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears, subTitle=null, stickyHeader=true, listTitleColor=#000000, tableCellBorderColor=#ccd1d5, relatedListFont=font-1, hideAuthors=true, tertiaryTextColor=#6c6c6c, buttonHoverTextColor=#ffffff, tableFont=font-1, carouselAutoPlay=false, promoTitleFont=font-2, _styledTemplate=/page/list/PageListH.hbs, ctaButtonText=[], primaryTextColor=#2a2a2a, buttonTextColor=#ffffff, linkTextColor=#1a1a1a, hideTitles=false, footerLinkColor=#ffffff, items=[{type=Image, media=[{alt=Super Bowl Football, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/f0/24/8f9a4cad4bfdb1077f131787f1a4/ap26034226663589.jpg, width=6500, height=4265}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/f0/24/8f9a4cad4bfdb1077f131787f1a4/ap26034226663589.jpg, width=6500, height=4265}}], authors=[{bio=[{items=[Jason Lieser covers the Chicago Bears for the Chicago Sun-Times.]}], media=[{image={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/db/45/4fa7d0e60b81cf16ace05e7c41e9/f5kj4hj-400x400-0.jpg, width=512, height=512}, narrowImage={src=https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/db/45/4fa7d0e60b81cf16ace05e7c41e9/f5kj4hj-400x400-0.jpg, width=512, height=512}, ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, _template=/image/Image.hbs, alt=Headshot of Chicago Bears reporter Jason Lieser}], ampLink=null, _styledTemplate=null, name=[{items=[Jason Lieser]}], _template=/author/byline/AuthorByline.hbs, authorPageUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/authors/jason-lieser, jobTitle=[{items=[Chicago Bears reporter]}]}], _styledTemplate=null, wordCount=963, imageAlignment=null, url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears/2026/02/08/super-bowl-lx-preview-seahawks-patriots-carry-weight-of-franchise-legacies-in-very-different-ways, isFeatured=false, publishDate=February 08, 2026 06:00 AM, anchorId=promo-c50000, target=null, primaryMediaType=null, category=[{items=[Bears]}], categoryUrl=https://chicago.suntimes.com/bears, title=Super Bowl LX preview: Seahawks, Patriots carry weight of franchise legacies in very different ways, ampLink=null, audio=[], audioDuration=null, timestamp=1770552000000, description=[{items=[Plus, what to watch for when the Seahawks have the ball (Sam Darnold is the real deal) and when Patriots have the ball (rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson must produce).]}], _template=/page/promo/PagePromo.hbs}, {type=Image, category=[{items=[Bears]}], description=[{items=[The Bears drafted him ninth overall expecting he’d be an elite game-changer.

Just the opposite. Once showcases for generic mass-produced canvases ranging from kitsch to trash, lately they lean toward cutesy black and white photos echoing the visual cliche of the moment. Vintage cars. Soda signs. Cowboys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you are forgiven for missing the fact that, for years, what would become the most expensive painting ever sold by a living artist hung largely unnoticed  in a downtown Chicago hotel lobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was \"Domplatz, Mailand\" by Gerhard Richter, who is still alive — in fact, Monday, Feb. 9 is his 94th birthday.    Richter is having a banner year, with a big show in Paris, and since my going is out of the question, the second best thing is to tell how one of his major works ended up next to the front desk at the Park Hyatt Chicago on Michigan Avenue, and why it is now gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-ea0000\" name=\"module-ea0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Opinion bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pritzker family — the clan of Illinois'  governor — runs the Hyatt chain of over 1,000 hotels. In 2000, wanting something to jazz up its new crown jewel, the Park Hyatt Chicago, a 70-story edifice at the corner of Michigan and Chicago, the Pritzkers decided to dig deep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we were building the hotel, my cousin, Nick, said, ‘Let’s go all in and get a great piece of art,'\" Thomas Pritzker, then CEO and now executive chairman, of the Pritzker organization, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3972382144120426476/1331396329574314552#\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;told Sotheby’s&lt;/a&gt; in 2014. “So he chose the Richter.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richter is an abstract German artist whose work is something of the love child of impressionism and photo realism. \"Domplatz, Mailand\" was commissioned in 1968 by the Siemens Corporation, the German technology conglomerate, for its Milan headquarters and shows a blurry black and white image of the Cathedral Square there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyatt bought the painting in London for $3.6 million — not exactly cheap to begin with — and hung it in the Park Hyatt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could pretend I know about the painting because my thumb is pressed on the pulse of all things cultural. Though the truth may be actually even cooler, in a lunch bucket vibe way. I've never stayed at the Park Hyatt. The only reason the hotel is on my radar is because it was erected during the late 1990s building boom. Tower cranes were everywhere and, curious guy that I am, I started wondering about the cranes — how do they get up there? — so took a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1999, crackerjack photographer Robert A. Davis and I visited the crane atop the nearly-completed Park Hyatt. That adventure bonded me to the place — being at the tip of the crane boom as it swung out 600 feet over Michigan Avenue will do that — and I made a point of circling back to see what it looked like when finished. The Richter caught my eye; it's hard to miss  being nine feet square. Guiding out-of-town guests through their Magnificent Mile window shopping, I'd detour into the hotel to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The painting hung in the lobby for 15 years, except during 2002, when the hotel lent it to the Museum of Modern Art for a traveling retrospective of 40 years of Richter's work that included the Art Institute of Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the schlock that hangs on most hotel walls, we ought to bow our heads for a moment in honor of that. Chicago hotels were once so well decorated that they'd loan their artwork to major museums. And LaSalle Bank used to have a full-time photo curator to manage its first-rate photography collection, before Bank of America bought it and stripped its soul like the spine being lifted out of a whitefish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine art costs money — even insuring it costs a lot — and the airy aspirations of the chain owners ran into the practical considerations of the bean counters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we were updating our insurance policies, we figured out the value,” Pritzker said. “I was astounded. Hyatt is a public company, and our job is to create shareholder value, so we decided it was in the best interest to sell it. But we would redeploy that capital in an art program.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create value they did, selling the painting in May 2013 for $37.1 million, a hefty profit and a record for a living artist at the time. (Surpassed that November, by a Jeff Koons balloon dog fetching $58 million.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"It worked out really well.” Pritzker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only question left: What is hanging in the Richter's place? I headed over, hoping it would be an anonymous hemp fabric sculpture or generic painting of ducks. No such luck: a dramatic and colorful painting by Richard Prince that guests routinely mistake for a work by Jean-Michel Basquiat.

He didn’t hide that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just confidence,” Dillingham responded, when asked what he needed to do to take the next step in his NBA journey. “Confidence from my teammates, confidence from my coaches. I just feel like I haven’t gotten a super opportunity where I feel confident. Just gaining that back and realizing I’ve been working the whole time so it’s not like it automatically left where I wasn’t as good. I’m just waiting for the spark to come back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first flicker came on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dillingham not only played a season-high 22 minutes in his Bulls debut but scored nine points and facilitated two nasty lob dunks – which is an art form previous Bulls point guards rarely displayed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, his speed and shiftiness were on full display, which is also an element that’s been missing from Donovan’s offense for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ayo Dosunmu was fast but more straight-line speed. Coby White used his strong frame to drive to the rim. Josh Giddey has positional size. Even Lonzo Ball wasn’t considered a shifty point guard.&lt;br&gt;Dillingham not only has quickness, but a wiggle to him. That’s what Donovan has to bring out and elevate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At times we’ve struggled to get downhill,” Donovan said. “He’s the one guy when the ball is in his hand that can really break people down, play off the dribble, and put some pressure on the basket.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all that said, Donovan also wants to get to the bottom of what went wrong between guard and former team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A talk is coming and hopefully some honesty with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Minnesota has been trying to find another guard to take another step,” Donovan said. “They’ve been to the Western Conference Finals, so I’m looking forward to talking to him, like, ‘Why weren’t you playing because they were looking for somebody?’ This is an area of growth for him where he’s on a team that is trying to win, going for it right now, and they’re looking for some help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is my whole point with young players. They’ve got to be able to understand things that go into winning. And I’m not saying that Rob does or does not. Maybe they didn’t like the way the team was structured, and he wasn’t the right fit, I don’t know what it was. But all these guys, these draft picks, they’ve got to impact winning at some point and move past just the talent. It’s more of how do you impact winning?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news for both Donovan and Dillingham is they at least have time to figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the four new guards acquired, both Collin Sexton and Anfernee Simons are unrestricted free agents, and Jaden Ivey is restricted. Dillingham is only in Year 2 of his rookie contract. That means he’ll get an opportunity he wasn’t getting with Minnesota and do so in a more up-tempo offense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s all he can ask for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Opportunity is really however many minutes I get,” Dillingham said. “Whether I get five, 10, 15, 20, just trying to play and do the most with my opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Coach said he feels like it’s a better offense I can run and will be helpful for me. I just want to fit in.”&lt;/p&gt;",

The network's games will appear across NBC, NBCSN and Peacock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re excited to welcome Clayton, Anthony and Joey, three stars right off the field who can provide fresh perspective on the players, teams, and everything that makes baseball special,” NBC Sports executive producer and president of production Sam Flood said. “We look forward to rolling out some new concepts to take advantage of the unique insights of each analyst, beginning on Opening Day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rizzo, a three-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glove winner, was the face of the Cubs' 2016 World Series championship team, the franchise's first since 1908. He slashed .360/.484/.600 in that World Series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBC is beginning a three-year deal to carry what was ESPN's baseball package, which includes Sunday night games and every wild-card series. NBC also regained the \"MLB Sunday Leadoff\" package of early Sunday games, which will be exclusive to streaming service Peacock. The network's coverage will debut on Opening Day, March 26, with Pirates-Mets at noon and Diamondbacks-Dodgers at 7 p.m., when the Dodgers will raise their World Series banner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rizzo's Cubs are scheduled for two appearances on Sunday nights: May 31 at the Cardinals and June 7 against the Giants. They also are part of a Sunday doubleheader Aug. 3 with a 2 p.m. game against the Reds. All three games will air on NBC and Peacock.&lt;/p&gt;",

Pace, who was vice president of football operations, is out following the arrival new president of football Matt Ryan and general manager Ian Cunningham, NFL Network reported. It was unclear whether he was fired or they parted mutually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Falcons went 30-38 during Pace’s time in their front office under former general manager Terry Fontenot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pace, 48, got his first shot at being a general manager when the Bears hired him in 2015 after a long run as a Saints scout and executive. Both of his head-coaching hires, John Fox and Matt Nagy, were fired in four seasons or fewer. Both of his first-round picks at quarterback, Mitch Trubisky and Justin Fields, failed to establish themselves and earn a second contract with the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bears went 48-65 with two playoff appearances under Pace (one for going 8-8 in 2020), and he left them in shambles when they fired him after the 2021 season. New general manager Ryan Poles inherited a team that had spent itself into a salary-cap mess and mortgaged its future draft capital, prompting him to do a full teardown in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only players left on the Bears’ roster from the Pace era are kicker Cairo Santos, tight end Cole Kmet and cornerback Jaylon Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;",

Alice, a former actress who has better manners, perhaps, but shares her husband’s haughty superiority to their neighbors, manages to insult her servants to the point that they leave and then bemoans the wear on her hands from housework she doesn’t seem to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She insults Edgar even more, and he returns the favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their one pleasure, likely done daily, is for Alice to play a march on the piano that Edgar dances to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dance epitomizes Perry’s unique take on Edgar — it’s kooky yet committed. Like so much of what Edgar does in this play, Perry makes it impossible to know whether the character takes the dance seriously or is being purposefully silly, just as nobody can ever tell whether he’s telling the truth, even when he’s clutching his heart or his head in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes Alice, but even more so the third wheel in the play, Alice’s cousin Curt (Cliff Chamberlain), who introduced the couple before his own difficult divorce led him to leave the country. He has returned to establish a quarantine ward on the island. His arrival provides a new opportunity — perhaps the first since they sent their two children to boarding school — for the couple to compete for someone’s sympathy, demanding in essence that he take sides in their ongoing warfare, which they relish as much as they despise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The performances are all extraordinary and, essentially, intertwined. This really is Steppenwolf acting at its very best, and that’s saying a whole lot. It’s quirkily personal, wholly involved, thoroughly in the moment, unafraid of embracing the characters’ darkest instincts, deepest guilt or strangest desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-1e0000\" name=\"image-1e0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4dcf742/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+118/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffe%2F6a%2F0510c2b6433ebc8d9408267ebeee%2Fthe-dance-of-death-6-photo-by-michael-brosilow.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1d507f1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+118/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffe%2F6a%2F0510c2b6433ebc8d9408267ebeee%2Fthe-dance-of-death-6-photo-by-michael-brosilow.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a742885/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x1010+0+118/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ffe%2F6a%2F0510c2b6433ebc8d9408267ebeee%2Fthe-dance-of-death-6-photo-by-michael-brosilow.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"The Dance of Death 6.

It’s naturalistic — these are real people in a real place and time confronting and confused by real emotions that they couldn’t explain even if they wanted to. It’s expressionistic — in Rick Sims’ sound design, Edgar seems to be chased by a voice calling him to the grave. It’s absurdist — Edgar and Alice, like Vladimir and Estragon in “Waiting for Godot,” seem above all to simply be desperately filling the time in a world where purpose is a punch line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly not a coincidence that Perry’s hair and mustache are styled to resemble portraits of Strindberg himself. What emerges so clearly here is the deep and direct engagement of interpretive artists — directors, actors, designers, even the adapter — with the source creator, and not with the preconceived notions that have built up around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swedish Strindberg himself bore plenty of suffering, many of the details reflected in various plot points of “Dance of Death.” But one thing I now know for sure. He developed, or maintained, a deeply dark sense of humor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll never see his work the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;",
