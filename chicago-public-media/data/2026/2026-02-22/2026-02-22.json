The plan, Boyd said, is to use him like a starter – but that also includes piggyback setups like the Cubs used last March in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the second exhibition game in Japan last spring, Boyd technically entered in relief, but that was scripted. He went through his normal start-day routine, and the Cubs had reliever &lt;b&gt;Daniel Palencia&lt;/b&gt; throw ⅔ of an inning to bridge the gap between right-handed starter &lt;b&gt;Jameson Taillon&lt;/b&gt; and Boyd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that game, on March 16, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/03/16/cubs-matt-boyd-has-his-best-outing-so-far-this-spring-in-exhibition-game-vs-yomiuri-giants\"   &gt;Boyd showcased a jump in velocity&lt;/a&gt;. Then he went on to have a healthy 2025 season and collect the first All-Star selection of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's WBC is in a similar time frame, running from March 6-17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Very comparable,\" Boyd said. “That's part of the reason why it was such an easy yes to go do the WBC stuff, is this because it's very similar to what we did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Boyd struck out two of the first three batters he faced but allowed three singles in the first inning. He navigated the traffic successfully to keep the Rangers from scoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second inning played out similarly, with two strikeouts, a double and a single. But Boyd allowed a run before handing the ball over with two outs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was good work,” Boyd said, “Pitched with some runners on base, had to work with a guy on second, had to start some guys off with off speed and whatnot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Long exits after collision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cubs first baseman &lt;b&gt;Jonathon Long &lt;/b&gt;left the game in the fourth inning Saturday with a sprained left elbow, according to the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Rangers’ Mark Canha raced up the line to beat out a ground ball to the left side of the infield, shortstop &lt;b&gt;Jefferson Rojas&lt;/b&gt;’ throw pulled Long into the basepath. Canha ran into Long’s extended glove. Long dropped the ball, and hunched over, cradling his left arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an on-field examination, Long exited the field with head athletic trainer &lt;b&gt;Nick Frangella&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long, a non-roster invitee, was scheduled to depart Cubs camp next week to join the Chinese Taipei national team for the WBC. The injury raised questions about his availability for the tournament, but he will be re-evaluated Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ballesteros en route&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/15/cubs-moises-ballesteros-likely-to-be-delayed-by-visa-issues-for-another-week\"   &gt;visa issues catcher&lt;b&gt; Moisés Ballesteros&lt;/b&gt; had been navigating,&lt;/a&gt; he also went through flight delays, manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell &lt;/b&gt;said Saturday. Ballesteros was not in camp Saturday morning, but he had reached Houston, Texas – a promising sign in a saga that’s already delayed his arrival a week and half past his report date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s not expected to appear in spring training this week, as he ramps up, but Counsell isn’t expecting the delay to impact Ballesteros’ readiness for the season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Martin Luther King Jr.. The reverend joined King’s cause and carried that mission to Chicago, where he championed key causes of the Civil Rights Movement, including racial equality, economic justice and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was my hero. He was my mentor,” Eaddy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson’s wife, Jacqueline Jackson, and children sat in the front row during the forum while members of the community filled almost every seat in Rainbow PUSH’s South Side auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev.

With his old Detroit team in town, both head coaches discussed his future and why they still see a high-ceiling player in him.\" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/597502f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3179x2120+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2Fa1%2F8d69ab4345018debc27cddf58a33%2F2260456901.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;In the eyes of the Pistons and head coach J.B. Bickerstaff, it was never about if Jaden Ivey would recover from the horrific leg injury he suffered last season with Detroit, but what would be the timeline?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That question is still being asked, especially in the wake of Saturday’s news that the Bulls – Ivey’s new team thanks to the trade deadline – has shut him down for at least two weeks, concerned with how he’s looked since the deal was made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expected a full recovery, but the timing you never know, which is something you can never know,” Bickerstaff said. “And then the part for him is believing and trusting in it, that happens with the injury too, especially when you’re explosive and your athleticism is so unique. You got to find that trust back in it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which Ivey obviously has struggled with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his first 30 games pre-injury last season, Bickerstaff was watching Ivey take off, filling it up with 17.6 points per game and shooting just under 41% from three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his return to play this season, Detroit was giving him 17 minutes per game, he was averaging 8.2 points and shooting 37% from three with obvious drops in his play-making and explosiveness. In his first four games with the Bulls, he was getting the minutes before not playing against Toronto but looked caught in cement far too often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of controversy coming out of his DNP (Did Not Play) and it wasn’t helped when he declared “old J.I. is dead” afterward, but Bulls coach Billy Donovan said it was decided before that Thursday game that Ivey would sit so he could get the soreness in his knee checked out a day later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certainly, it was our decision coaching-staff wise that he did not play, but I think medical guys saw that he was not moving great,” Donovan said. “They had something scheduled (Friday) to get him looked at. Clearly, we’ve got to remove some soreness to get him better, but he has to do some strengthening too with a lot of the muscles around his knee.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will be the immediate plan for the guard. Two weeks of strengthening and getting the leg stronger and then a re-evaluation. That doesn’t mean he’ll play again this season, but that remained the hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to come back from that type of injury isn’t easy,” Bickerstaff added of Ivey. “Having to do it in a situation where the team has kind of established itself when you were away, and now you’re trying to find your rhythm and not step on anyone’s toes … he wasn’t in an easy situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A big yes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls also announced that Zach Collins would miss the rest of the season, as doctors have decided that his toe injury would be better served if he underwent surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The often-injured big man only played 10 games this season and will be a free agent, but Donovan was all in for bringing him back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When a guy is in free agency there’s the financial piece of it and then there’s the part of the player, the make-up, the character,” Donovan said. “It’s hard for me knowing what a guy’s value is financially, but from my perspective as it relates to winning, when he’s out there and healthy he’s a very good player for us. From that standpoint I would hope it would all work out for him to be back here next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Happy return&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eastern Conference-leading Detroit got reinforcements back against the Bulls as Jalen Duren’s two-game suspension for a Feb. 9 fight with Charlotte ended. The Pistons were still without Isaiah Stewart, who was suspended seven games for his part in the altercation.&lt;/p&gt;",

He also picked up a ground-ball single that deflected off the end of second baseman James Triantos’ glove as he dove, and threw it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Definitely a lot of fun,” Shaw said. “Listening to [center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong,] he's guiding me along.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw’s first spring training game in the outfield wasn’t much of a test. But he’ll get more opportunities as he continues to learn the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want the tougher plays, you want the plays that don't happen as much,” manager Craig Counsell said Saturday morning. “The fly ball that goes straight up and then he catches it, and then we all [say,] ‘Oh, he can play right field,’ that tells us nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're looking for more than that. So, you want action, you want weird plays. Those are the experiences that make you better and cause growth. And the best way to do it is just have innings out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw, transitioning this year from third base to a utility role, has had similar conversations with Counsell. The Cubs plan to play Shaw all over, but outfield will be a focus in spring because he’s had fewer game reps there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It feels like I'm kind of a kid again, running around, catching balls, diving and stuff,” Shaw said earlier this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw played outfield growing up, with his most recent experience coming five years ago in collegiate summer ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest challenge is, now that I'm going to be playing outfield, playing second, playing third, just balancing all of that,” Shaw said, “making sure I can stay healthy and stay in good shape.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Cubs coaching staff, left fielder Ian Happ is someone Shaw can lean on for advice as he finds that balance. Happ came up as a utility player before finding a home in the outfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm sure he'll be &lt;i&gt;super&lt;/i&gt; helpful,” Shaw said. “He already has been.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw told the story of how he reached out to Happ about whether he should get a 14 ½ -inch outfielder’s glove. The problem is, manufacturers don’t make baseball gloves that big, which Happ made sure to let him know. Anything longer than 13 inches is banned in the MLB rulebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the little things, you know?” Happ said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was joking, but the quip actually summed up Happ's real advice for juggling multiple positions. Early in his career, Happ leaned on super utility player Ben Zobrist for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want to go and do a bunch of things in the outfield and be the best outfitter you can be,” Happ said. “But Ben Zobrist was really good with me about, it's not necessarily about making the flashy plays, it’s about doing all the little things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happ plans to have similar conversations with Shaw this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw can drill down on technique in practice. But there are some elements to outfield defense, like communication, situations, and navigating the wall, that can’t be fully replicated in that setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“True, true game speed, has to happen in-game,” Counsell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Shaw gets comfortable playing outfield in spring training, the next challenge will be playing right at Wrigley Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Be careful with the wind,” right fielder Seiya Suzuki said through interpreter Edwin Stanberry when asked what his advice would be. “And be careful about the wall next to the foul line; it's dangerous.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Glory&lt;/a&gt;!” show, which opened Friday. Some are missing stars, others hang upside down. One replaces the stars with tufts of cotton and the white stripes with African prints. Another, \"American't\" by Nnaemeka Ekwelum, is woven with plastic lacing material. It is also adorned with military dog tags bearing the names of Black children killed by police or otherwise harmed in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I like the idea of looking at this image and saying, ‘Something is off about this,’” said Ekwelum, 35, of Rogers Park. “And I think that's how we should feel when we look at the flag.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is on view at the Bridgeport venue Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., through March 20. It is part of Pigment International’s year-long programming, “America 250 — We ARE the people,” which honors the 250th anniversary of the nation's founding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-7c0000\" name=\"module-7c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Glory!

The Trump administration is encouraging artistic celebrations of America’s 250th birthday as it dismantles civil rights protections and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives for Black Americans. “Glory! Glory!” captures that dissonance with pieces by artists who say they are telling a full and complicated story of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can't divorce us from this history,” said Patricia Andrews-Keenan, founder of Pigment International. “I’m patriotic. Sometimes that can be a little bit of a conflict because I know the good parts of our history and I know the bad parts of our history, but it's still our history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-070000\" name=\"image-070000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/acd95b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/820x460+0+68/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Fc2%2F8648b1344c99a3b6004ef48729be%2Fcopy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-untitled-design.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8978cf5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/820x460+0+68/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Fc2%2F8648b1344c99a3b6004ef48729be%2Fcopy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-untitled-design.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d543b13/2147483647/strip/true/crop/820x460+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Fc2%2F8648b1344c99a3b6004ef48729be%2Fcopy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-untitled-design.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"From left: Reggie McFly&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;Land of the Free&amp;quot; and Candace Hunter&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;BIRTH OF A NEW NATION&amp;quot; are on display at Pigment International&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;Glory Glory&amp;quot; exhibition at Zhou B Art Center in Bridgeport, Friday, Feb. 20, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d543b13/2147483647/strip/true/crop/820x460+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Fc2%2F8648b1344c99a3b6004ef48729be%2Fcopy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-untitled-design.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f7d2c48/2147483647/strip/true/crop/820x460+0+68/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Fc2%2F8648b1344c99a3b6004ef48729be%2Fcopy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-untitled-design.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d543b13/2147483647/strip/true/crop/820x460+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Fc2%2F8648b1344c99a3b6004ef48729be%2Fcopy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-untitled-design.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reggie McFly’s “Land of the Free,” left, and Candace Hunter’s “BIRTH OF A NEW NATION” are on display at Pigment International’s “Glory Glory” exhibition at Zhou B Art Center in Bridgeport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arthur Maiorella/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is awarding &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.arts.gov/initiatives/celebrating-americas-250th-anniversary\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;National Endowment for the Arts grants&lt;/a&gt; for anniversary-based programming, but Pigment International was not selected as a grantee.

The piece also includes 44 colorful wooden stars and red and white stripes painted over newspapers announcing Obama’s historic win in the 2008 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to inspire people to achieve their goals,” said Clark, 58, who created the piece more than a decade ago, when Obama was still in office.
