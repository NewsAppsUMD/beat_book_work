The plan, Boyd said, is to use him like a starter – but that also includes piggyback setups like the Cubs used last March in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the second exhibition game in Japan last spring, Boyd technically entered in relief, but that was scripted. He went through his normal start-day routine, and the Cubs had reliever &lt;b&gt;Daniel Palencia&lt;/b&gt; throw ⅔ of an inning to bridge the gap between right-handed starter &lt;b&gt;Jameson Taillon&lt;/b&gt; and Boyd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that game, on March 16, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2025/03/16/cubs-matt-boyd-has-his-best-outing-so-far-this-spring-in-exhibition-game-vs-yomiuri-giants\"   &gt;Boyd showcased a jump in velocity&lt;/a&gt;. Then he went on to have a healthy 2025 season and collect the first All-Star selection of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's WBC is in a similar time frame, running from March 6-17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Very comparable,\" Boyd said. “That's part of the reason why it was such an easy yes to go do the WBC stuff, is this because it's very similar to what we did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Boyd struck out two of the first three batters he faced but allowed three singles in the first inning. He navigated the traffic successfully to keep the Rangers from scoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second inning played out similarly, with two strikeouts, a double and a single. But Boyd allowed a run before handing the ball over with two outs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was good work,” Boyd said, “Pitched with some runners on base, had to work with a guy on second, had to start some guys off with off speed and whatnot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Long exits after collision&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cubs first baseman &lt;b&gt;Jonathon Long &lt;/b&gt;left the game in the fourth inning Saturday with a sprained left elbow, according to the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Rangers’ Mark Canha raced up the line to beat out a ground ball to the left side of the infield, shortstop &lt;b&gt;Jefferson Rojas&lt;/b&gt;’ throw pulled Long into the basepath. Canha ran into Long’s extended glove. Long dropped the ball, and hunched over, cradling his left arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an on-field examination, Long exited the field with head athletic trainer &lt;b&gt;Nick Frangella&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long, a non-roster invitee, was scheduled to depart Cubs camp next week to join the Chinese Taipei national team for the WBC. The injury raised questions about his availability for the tournament, but he will be re-evaluated Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ballesteros en route&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/cubs/2026/02/15/cubs-moises-ballesteros-likely-to-be-delayed-by-visa-issues-for-another-week\"   &gt;visa issues catcher&lt;b&gt; Moisés Ballesteros&lt;/b&gt; had been navigating,&lt;/a&gt; he also went through flight delays, manager &lt;b&gt;Craig Counsell &lt;/b&gt;said Saturday. Ballesteros was not in camp Saturday morning, but he had reached Houston, Texas – a promising sign in a saga that’s already delayed his arrival a week and half past his report date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s not expected to appear in spring training this week, as he ramps up, but Counsell isn’t expecting the delay to impact Ballesteros’ readiness for the season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Martin Luther King Jr.. The reverend joined King’s cause and carried that mission to Chicago, where he championed key causes of the Civil Rights Movement, including racial equality, economic justice and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He was my hero. He was my mentor,” Eaddy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson’s wife, Jacqueline Jackson, and children sat in the front row during the forum while members of the community filled almost every seat in Rainbow PUSH’s South Side auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rev.

With his old Detroit team in town, both head coaches discussed his future and why they still see a high-ceiling player in him.\" src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/597502f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3179x2120+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F0f%2Fa1%2F8d69ab4345018debc27cddf58a33%2F2260456901.jpg\" />\n        \n        \n            &lt;p&gt;In the eyes of the Pistons and head coach J.B. Bickerstaff, it was never about if Jaden Ivey would recover from the horrific leg injury he suffered last season with Detroit, but what would be the timeline?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That question is still being asked, especially in the wake of Saturday’s news that the Bulls – Ivey’s new team thanks to the trade deadline – has shut him down for at least two weeks, concerned with how he’s looked since the deal was made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expected a full recovery, but the timing you never know, which is something you can never know,” Bickerstaff said. “And then the part for him is believing and trusting in it, that happens with the injury too, especially when you’re explosive and your athleticism is so unique. You got to find that trust back in it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which Ivey obviously has struggled with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his first 30 games pre-injury last season, Bickerstaff was watching Ivey take off, filling it up with 17.6 points per game and shooting just under 41% from three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his return to play this season, Detroit was giving him 17 minutes per game, he was averaging 8.2 points and shooting 37% from three with obvious drops in his play-making and explosiveness. In his first four games with the Bulls, he was getting the minutes before not playing against Toronto but looked caught in cement far too often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of controversy coming out of his DNP (Did Not Play) and it wasn’t helped when he declared “old J.I. is dead” afterward, but Bulls coach Billy Donovan said it was decided before that Thursday game that Ivey would sit so he could get the soreness in his knee checked out a day later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certainly, it was our decision coaching-staff wise that he did not play, but I think medical guys saw that he was not moving great,” Donovan said. “They had something scheduled (Friday) to get him looked at. Clearly, we’ve got to remove some soreness to get him better, but he has to do some strengthening too with a lot of the muscles around his knee.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will be the immediate plan for the guard. Two weeks of strengthening and getting the leg stronger and then a re-evaluation. That doesn’t mean he’ll play again this season, but that remained the hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to come back from that type of injury isn’t easy,” Bickerstaff added of Ivey. “Having to do it in a situation where the team has kind of established itself when you were away, and now you’re trying to find your rhythm and not step on anyone’s toes … he wasn’t in an easy situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A big yes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls also announced that Zach Collins would miss the rest of the season, as doctors have decided that his toe injury would be better served if he underwent surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The often-injured big man only played 10 games this season and will be a free agent, but Donovan was all in for bringing him back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When a guy is in free agency there’s the financial piece of it and then there’s the part of the player, the make-up, the character,” Donovan said. “It’s hard for me knowing what a guy’s value is financially, but from my perspective as it relates to winning, when he’s out there and healthy he’s a very good player for us. From that standpoint I would hope it would all work out for him to be back here next year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Happy return&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eastern Conference-leading Detroit got reinforcements back against the Bulls as Jalen Duren’s two-game suspension for a Feb. 9 fight with Charlotte ended. The Pistons were still without Isaiah Stewart, who was suspended seven games for his part in the altercation.&lt;/p&gt;",

He also picked up a ground-ball single that deflected off the end of second baseman James Triantos’ glove as he dove, and threw it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Definitely a lot of fun,” Shaw said. “Listening to [center fielder Pete Crow-Armstrong,] he's guiding me along.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw’s first spring training game in the outfield wasn’t much of a test. But he’ll get more opportunities as he continues to learn the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want the tougher plays, you want the plays that don't happen as much,” manager Craig Counsell said Saturday morning. “The fly ball that goes straight up and then he catches it, and then we all [say,] ‘Oh, he can play right field,’ that tells us nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We're looking for more than that. So, you want action, you want weird plays. Those are the experiences that make you better and cause growth. And the best way to do it is just have innings out there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw, transitioning this year from third base to a utility role, has had similar conversations with Counsell. The Cubs plan to play Shaw all over, but outfield will be a focus in spring because he’s had fewer game reps there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It feels like I'm kind of a kid again, running around, catching balls, diving and stuff,” Shaw said earlier this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw played outfield growing up, with his most recent experience coming five years ago in collegiate summer ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest challenge is, now that I'm going to be playing outfield, playing second, playing third, just balancing all of that,” Shaw said, “making sure I can stay healthy and stay in good shape.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Cubs coaching staff, left fielder Ian Happ is someone Shaw can lean on for advice as he finds that balance. Happ came up as a utility player before finding a home in the outfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm sure he'll be &lt;i&gt;super&lt;/i&gt; helpful,” Shaw said. “He already has been.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw told the story of how he reached out to Happ about whether he should get a 14 ½ -inch outfielder’s glove. The problem is, manufacturers don’t make baseball gloves that big, which Happ made sure to let him know. Anything longer than 13 inches is banned in the MLB rulebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the little things, you know?” Happ said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was joking, but the quip actually summed up Happ's real advice for juggling multiple positions. Early in his career, Happ leaned on super utility player Ben Zobrist for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You want to go and do a bunch of things in the outfield and be the best outfitter you can be,” Happ said. “But Ben Zobrist was really good with me about, it's not necessarily about making the flashy plays, it’s about doing all the little things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happ plans to have similar conversations with Shaw this spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shaw can drill down on technique in practice. But there are some elements to outfield defense, like communication, situations, and navigating the wall, that can’t be fully replicated in that setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“True, true game speed, has to happen in-game,” Counsell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Shaw gets comfortable playing outfield in spring training, the next challenge will be playing right at Wrigley Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Be careful with the wind,” right fielder Seiya Suzuki said through interpreter Edwin Stanberry when asked what his advice would be. “And be careful about the wall next to the foul line; it's dangerous.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

Glory&lt;/a&gt;!” show, which opened Friday. Some are missing stars, others hang upside down. One replaces the stars with tufts of cotton and the white stripes with African prints. Another, \"American't\" by Nnaemeka Ekwelum, is woven with plastic lacing material. It is also adorned with military dog tags bearing the names of Black children killed by police or otherwise harmed in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I like the idea of looking at this image and saying, ‘Something is off about this,’” said Ekwelum, 35, of Rogers Park. “And I think that's how we should feel when we look at the flag.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exhibition is on view at the Bridgeport venue Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., through March 20. It is part of Pigment International’s year-long programming, “America 250 — We ARE the people,” which honors the 250th anniversary of the nation's founding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-7c0000\" name=\"module-7c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Glory!

The Trump administration is encouraging artistic celebrations of America’s 250th birthday as it dismantles civil rights protections and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives for Black Americans. “Glory! Glory!” captures that dissonance with pieces by artists who say they are telling a full and complicated story of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can't divorce us from this history,” said Patricia Andrews-Keenan, founder of Pigment International. “I’m patriotic. Sometimes that can be a little bit of a conflict because I know the good parts of our history and I know the bad parts of our history, but it's still our history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-070000\" name=\"image-070000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/acd95b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/820x460+0+68/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Fc2%2F8648b1344c99a3b6004ef48729be%2Fcopy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-untitled-design.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8978cf5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/820x460+0+68/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Fc2%2F8648b1344c99a3b6004ef48729be%2Fcopy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-untitled-design.png 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d543b13/2147483647/strip/true/crop/820x460+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Fc2%2F8648b1344c99a3b6004ef48729be%2Fcopy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-untitled-design.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"From left: Reggie McFly&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;Land of the Free&amp;quot; and Candace Hunter&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;BIRTH OF A NEW NATION&amp;quot; are on display at Pigment International&amp;#x27;s &amp;quot;Glory Glory&amp;quot; exhibition at Zhou B Art Center in Bridgeport, Friday, Feb. 20, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d543b13/2147483647/strip/true/crop/820x460+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Fc2%2F8648b1344c99a3b6004ef48729be%2Fcopy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-untitled-design.png 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f7d2c48/2147483647/strip/true/crop/820x460+0+68/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Fc2%2F8648b1344c99a3b6004ef48729be%2Fcopy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-untitled-design.png 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d543b13/2147483647/strip/true/crop/820x460+0+68/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Fc2%2F8648b1344c99a3b6004ef48729be%2Fcopy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-copy-of-untitled-design.png\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reggie McFly’s “Land of the Free,” left, and Candace Hunter’s “BIRTH OF A NEW NATION” are on display at Pigment International’s “Glory Glory” exhibition at Zhou B Art Center in Bridgeport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arthur Maiorella/For the Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration is awarding &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.arts.gov/initiatives/celebrating-americas-250th-anniversary\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;National Endowment for the Arts grants&lt;/a&gt; for anniversary-based programming, but Pigment International was not selected as a grantee.

The piece also includes 44 colorful wooden stars and red and white stripes painted over newspapers announcing Obama’s historic win in the 2008 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to inspire people to achieve their goals,” said Clark, 58, who created the piece more than a decade ago, when Obama was still in office.

He scored the winner unassisted 11 minutes later off a deflection. Santos joined the Dynamo after scoring 95 goals in 429 appearances for Brazilian Série A side Santos FC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's a good lesson for us,\" Fire coach Gregg Berhalter said. ’’We stopped playing and came out of the locker room and it was like we stayed in the locker room. Really, no movement for each other. It's like we were on autopilot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;’’If we go out and we play at half speed, we're a below-average team. When you see in the first half, when we play with real tempo, it's a really good product. But unfortunately, the second half was a very poor performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugo Cuypers picked up where he left off last season, scoring unassisted in the 31st minute to stake the Fire to a 1-0 lead. Cuypers had 17 goals in 33 appearances last season and scored 10 times in 31 appearances in 2024 — his first season in the league.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Bond totaled two saves for the Dynamo, while Chris Brady saved two shots for the Fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the game, Berhalter chose midfielder Anton Saletros as team captain, even though he was making his MLS debut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gregg asked me a couple hours before the game if I was comfortable [being] captain, even if it was my first game,” Saletros said. ”I said I'm comfortable with the guys since the start of the season, and I was happy to get that position from him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”We were very happy with the first half, and then second half is not up to our standards. We are very disappointed about that. So that is something we need to look through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fire play their home opener next Saturday against Montreal at Soldier Field (1:30 p.m., Apple TV, 890-AM). &lt;/p&gt;",

Let’s do it.’ ’’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was done, and Huerter hasn’t looked back since that deadline deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a 126-110 throttling of his former team at the United Center, Huerter has gone from a sinking ship to a team that has won five in a row and sits comfortably atop the East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s been great,” Huerter said, almost thankful that the Bulls did right by him on that front. “The transition, it’s always tough in season, even coming here last year, it was tough to move everything, your whole life, in about a week. But you’re going to a team like this, No. 1 in the East, and they just compete their ass off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bulls (24-33) found that out as a close game at the half turned into a laugher. The Pistons outscored the Bulls 44-26 in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the Bulls’ eighth loss in a row, and the skid isn’t likely to end soon with the Knicks coming to town Sunday, then the Hornets coming in Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Considering the post-trade-deadline roster that Donovan has at his disposal, maybe the Bulls are designed to lose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Josh Giddey and Tre Jones remained on minutes restrictions, Anfernee Simons left early with a sore wrist, Matas Buzelis is in a funk and Donovan still was juggling playing time for his plethora of guards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with Jaden Ivey — whom Huerter was traded for — sidelined with knee woes, Donovan only found eight-plus minutes for second-year guard Rob Dillingham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s nothing [Dillingham] has not done,” Donovan said. “It’s just managing all those guards. We’re going to have a logjam there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at this point, does it really matter who plays? If there’s one thing this group continues to do is show that it’s not easy to just throw a roster together and expect good things in a few weeks. Donovan has guys who are trying to understand how the player next to them functions and doing it in a new system for half the roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why it’s easy to point to the turnover category and see another ugly number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not trying to create some kind of moral victory, but I felt like it was the first game we played with the right intention,” Donovan said. “But we turned the ball over 23 times. You can’t win like that. Then we had three guys with four or five turnovers. You can’t have that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for Huerter’s homecoming, he again is trying to find his way into a role after sitting for a second game, but coach J.B. Bickerstaff insisted Huerter will contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a bigger surprise for Huerter than not playing was what the Bulls look like after all the trades two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We talked about it [as a team], and we just didn’t know,” Huerter said of the days leading up to the deadline. “We were sitting at .500 most of the year. It could have gone either way. As players, you have to expect everything, but seven or eight trades, whatever it was, I don’t know if anyone expected that.”&lt;/p&gt;",

We have three in our home — one off the kitchen, one upstairs and one in our upstairs bedroom suite. Despite the fact that she and my husband both know of my incontinence problem, she asked him to use our bathroom \"for privacy.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to run upstairs to use my bathroom. It was urgent. To my surprise, there she was using my bathroom. (We don't even allow our children to use this bathroom.) Because I couldn't make it to the toilet, I had a wetting accident. While I could have used any of the other bathrooms, I chose to use my own, expecting that it was vacant, knowing the other bathrooms were free for our guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was extremely upset with Paula. I yelled at her, and when she saw what had happened, she was extremely apologetic. Abby, Paula knows I have bladder control issues, yet she ignored it. My husband heard the commotion and hollered at me for yelling at his sister. Did I do wrong here? He has a hard time saying no to family, but jeepers, I needed a toilet! What should I have done? — &lt;i&gt;GOTTA GO IN NEW JERSEY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR GOTTA GO:&lt;/b&gt; Incontinence can happen to anyone at any age. It isn't just little old ladies. Between 24% and 45% of women have reported urinary incontinence, \"the problem no one wants to discuss.\" According to statistics from the National Institute of Health approximately 13 million individuals were affected by urinary incontinence in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You were wrong to yell at your sister-in-law, who had been granted permission to use that bathroom, but it's understandable given your distress and embarrassment. If you haven't apologized to her, you should. Frankly, the person who deserved yelling at is your husband, who may never understand the \"urgency\" until he experiences it himself. (Many men do!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR ABBY:&lt;/b&gt; Three years ago, you printed a letter from a grandmother who was upset about having to raise her grandson because his parents lacked the desire to do so. I never forgot that letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before it was published, my husband and I gained custody of our 7-year-old grandson, \"Keith.\" My husband and I were both retired and had been spending our winters in Florida. We gave up the Florida trips (willingly) to stay home and take care of our grandson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith had always spent a lot of time with us, but he was still upset that his parents had \"given him away.\" So, to keep busy, we joined karate, Boy Scouts, 4-H and school sports. It was one of the best times of my life. I learned new things and made new friends with grandmothers who were also raising grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith graduated from high school, found a good job, bought a house and recently married. We did OK! I hope \"Like a Mom in South Carolina\" (Nov. 3, 2022) is doing well, too. — &lt;i&gt;GRATEFUL GRANDMA IN NEW YORK&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR GRANDMA:&lt;/b&gt; Many grandparents today are raising their grandchildren, and many of them have success stories similar to your own.

JB Pritzker asked for his resignation. But after a mistrial, Jones, who succeeded his father, announced in December that he &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/chicago-corruption-trials/2025/12/11/illinois-sen-emil-jones-iii-strikes-deal-with-feds-to-avoid-conviction-in-bribery-case\"   &gt;reached an agreement&lt;/a&gt; with federal prosecutors that will keep him out of jail. Now he’s endorsed by large labor groups, and he’s potentially on the verge of beating two opponents in a March primary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power of multiple years of incumbency is hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whether you have moderate or reform candidates or anti-machine candidates, it still gets down to money and organization,” said Kent Redfield, a political science professor emeritus at University of lllinois Springfield. “If people are running for legislative seats, don’t have money and don’t have organization, it’s very difficult for them to communicate.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Newcomer Ahmed Karrar jumped into the race in January and Kenny Williams, who’s previously run for other offices, also is challenging Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I believe it is the time to have change in that position,” Williams said, referring to the seat he’s seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m running because working people in vulnerable communities have been neglected for some time now,” Karrar said. “I’m running to restore trust in government.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones said he has competitors because of the charges he faced,  which he said he can’t discuss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think my record speaks for itself over the last 16 years. I have been straightforward on issues. I have been able to vote my conscience for years,” Jones said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for his electability, he says, “Jones is a household name in this district.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democratic leadership is no longer asking for his resignation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Senator Jones has a strong political apparatus and has demonstrated time and again he's more than capable of running a good campaign that delivers his track record and message to the voters of his district. We're keeping a close eye on that race,” said a spokesman for Illinois Senate President Don Harmon, who hasn’t formally endorsed Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only other incumbent state senator facing a challenge is on the North Side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Sen. Sara Feigenholtz faces a challenge from first-time candidate Nick Uniejewski in the 6th district, which includes North Side lakefront communities Lakeview, Lincoln Park and Near North.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both candidates put transit at or near the top of their list of pressing issues. Feigenholtz touts her  long record in the Illinois Senate and House, while Uniejewski is running on a message of change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uniejewski can't compete as a fundraiser, and has instead relied on volunteers and social media messaging, particularly on TikTok. He said he and his supporters have knocked on tens of thousands of doors. Feigenholtz had more than $1.2 million in cash on hand at the end of last year, compared with just under $34,000 for Uniejewski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 9th Senate district, Patrick Hanley and Rachel Ruttenberg are competing to succeed Laura Fine, who is running in a crowded field of candidates for the 9th Congressional District seat now open with Jan Schakowsky’s decision to retire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Illinois House,  incumbent Rep. Jaime Andrade Jr. faces  a challenge from community organizer Miguel Alvelo Rivera in the  40th District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivera is endorsed by at least five elected officials, including U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez and Alds. Rossana Rodríguez-Sánchez (33rd) and Anthony Quezada (35th). Rivera is running as a progressive outsider, while Andrade said he has a track record with voters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Illinois House 8th District, Jill Bush, Shantel Franklin, John Harrell and Latonya Mitts are competing to succeed La Shawn Ford, who opted to run for the 7th Congressional District seat now open because of longtime incumbent Danny Davis' retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 12th House District, which includes northern lakefront neighborhoods, Margaret Croke is leaving  to run for state comptroller. That leaves Paul Kendrick, Litcy Kurisinkal, Karim Lakhani and Mac LeBuhn battling for the chance to serve in Springfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kendrick has racked up a number of endorsements, including one from Croke. He had more than $176,000 at the end of the year. LeBuhn wasn’t far behind with more than $145,000 at the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After two terms in the Illinois House, Hoan Huynh jumped into the race to succeed Schakowsky, leaving a wide open race in the 13th District on the North Side. Five candidates are vying for the seat,  including Adam Braun, Ridge Knapp, Sunjay Kumar, James O’Brien and Demi Palecek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 34th District, Cleopatra Cowley and Aja Kearney are vying for the seat being vacated by Nick Smith, who decided not to seek re-election.&lt;/p&gt;",

Filing a joint tax return means a person and their spouse report their combined income, credits and deductions. This also means that both people are responsible for any tax due.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other filing status married couples can choose when filing Form 1040 is married filing separately. Most married taxpayers choose to file a joint return since it can give them access to more tax credits and larger tax deductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couples qualify for married filing jointly status as long as they were married by Dec. 31 of the tax year they're filing for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who can use the married filing jointly status?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, people who are married can use this status, but certain life circumstances may affect eligibility to file a joint tax return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Divorce:&lt;/b&gt; If a person were married, but their divorce or separation was legally finalized during the tax year, the IRS considers that person unmarried for the entire tax year, and they can’t choose married filing jointly as their filing status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Annulment:&lt;/b&gt; If a person's marriage is annulled, they must file an amended tax return for certain years affected by the annulment. But note the statute of limitations, which is three years after filing an original return or two years after a person paid the tax, whichever is later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Death of a spouse:&lt;/b&gt; If a person's spouse died during the tax year or before filing their tax return, the IRS considers them married for the whole tax year, and they can choose married filing jointly as their filing status. If a person remarries the year of their spouse's death, they can't file jointly with their deceased spouse — that person must file either jointly or separately with their new spouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a spouse dies and a person has a dependent, that person might be able to file as a qualifying widower for two tax years after their spouse's death. This status allows one to reap the benefits of a higher standard deduction and a more favorable tax bracket than they would with a single filing status. Check with a tax preparer or a certified public accountant if unsure whether this applies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tax credits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big advantage of filing a joint return is that a person may qualify for certain tax credits they wouldn’t be able to claim under the married filing separately status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, a person can’t claim the following credits using the married filing separately status:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-bce66250-fcc4-11f0-b840-f32d38e9795f\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Earned income tax credit:&lt;/b&gt; Low-to-moderate-income taxpayers may be able to claim up to $8,046 on 2025 tax returns filed in 2026.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Child and dependent care credit:&lt;/b&gt; People caring for a child under 13 or a dependent with a disability can claim up to $2,100.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;American Opportunity tax credit:&lt;/b&gt; Taxpayers can claim this credit for qualified education expenses, up to a maximum of $2,500.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lifetime learning credit:&lt;/b&gt; This credit covers certain education costs up to a maximum of $2,000.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some exceptions to this rule, so check the IRS &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.irs.gov/credits-and-deductions\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;website&lt;/a&gt; about credits and deductions to see which credits one qualifies for given a specific tax situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Standard deduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most taxpayers can choose between itemizing and taking the standard deduction on their tax returns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joint filers get a higher standard deduction amount than single filers, heads of households and those married filing separately because they are allowed to combine their individual benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 standard deduction for married couples filing jointly is $31,500, which applies to taxes filed in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Married filing jointly versus separately&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it’s typically beneficial for most married couples to file a joint tax return, the IRS recommends running the numbers for both scenarios — married filing jointly and married filing separately — to see which option gives you the lower combined tax bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person may consider filing separately if:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-bce68961-fcc4-11f0-b840-f32d38e9795f\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;They have an income-based student loan repayment plan. Filing separately could lower adjusted gross income, which could lower their monthly bill. However, consider this carefully and do the math. Certain education tax credits aren’t available to married couples filing separate returns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They have large, unreimbursed medical bills. Since one can only deduct medical bills that exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income, a person might be able to deduct a greater amount by filing separately and reducing their adjusted gross income.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They and their spouse have a specific tax situation. If a spouse has overdue taxes that their partner doesn't want to be held liable for; if a person is in the middle of a divorce or if a person feels their spouse is being dishonest about tax information, filing separately could make sense.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;",

And when a person sells an asset for less than its original value, the money lost is known as a capital loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between a person's capital gains and their capital losses is their net profit. For example, if a person sold a stock for a $10,000 profit this year and sold another at a $4,000 loss, their net capital gain is $6,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most items people own are considered capital assets. This can include investments such as stocks, bonds, cryptocurrency or real estate, as well as personal and tangible items like cars or boats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital gains taxes are owed on profits made from the sale of assets. How much a person pays depends on what was sold, how long it was owned before selling, a person's taxable income and their filing status. Capital gains can be subject to either short-term or long-term tax rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some exceptions:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class=\"rte2-style-ul\" id=\"rte-f158acd0-fcc6-11f0-af0d-45cd6ee92692\"&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-earning individuals may also need to account for the net investment income tax, an additional 3.8% tax that can be triggered if their income exceeds a certain limit.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-term capital gains on so-called “collectible assets” can be taxed at a maximum of 28%. This includes items such as coins, precious metals, antiques and fine art. Short-term gains on such assets are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Long-term versus short-term tax&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Profits from the sale of an asset held for more than a year are subject to long-term capital gains tax. The rates are 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on taxable income and filing status. Most people pay no more than 15%, per the IRS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short-term capital gains tax applies to profits from the sale of an asset held for one year or less. Short-term capital gains are treated as regular income and taxed according to ordinary income tax brackets: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% or 37%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital gains taxes apply to assets that are \"realized,\" or sold. This means that the returns on stocks, bonds or other investments purchased through and then held within a brokerage are considered unrealized and not subject to capital gains tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one important caveat is investments that produce dividends. Even if a person hasn't sold a dividend stock or other dividend investment, the income they receive from the dividends may be considered a capital gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assets held within tax-advantaged accounts — such as a 401(k) or an individual retirement account — aren't subject to capital gains taxes while they remain in the account. Instead, you may pay regular income taxes when it comes time to make a qualified withdrawal, depending on what type of account it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Capital gains tax rate 2025&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following rates and brackets apply to long-term capital gains on assets sold in 2025, which are reported on taxes filed in 2026.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table id=\"rte-f158d3e0-fcc6-11f0-af0d-45cd6ee92692\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;Tax rate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;Single&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;Married filing jointly&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;Married filing separately&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;Head of household&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$0 to $48,350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$0 to $96,700&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$0 to $48,350&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$0 to $64,750&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$48,351 to $533,400&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$96,701 to $600,050&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$48,350 to $300,000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$64,751 to $566,700&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$533,401 or more&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$600,051 or more&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$300,001 or more&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$566,701 or more&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income, according to federal income tax brackets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Capital gains tax rate 2026&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following rates and brackets apply to long-term capital gains on assets sold in 2026, which are reported on taxes filed by April 15, 2027, or Oct. 15, 2027, with an extension.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table id=\"rte-f158d3e1-fcc6-11f0-af0d-45cd6ee92692\"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;Tax rate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;Single&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;Married filing jointly&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;Married filing separately&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;Head of household&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;0%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$0 to $49,450&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$0 to $98,900&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$0 to $49,450&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$0 to $66,200&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;15%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$49,451 to $545,500&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$98,901 to $613,700&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$49,451 to $306,850&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$66,201 to $579,600&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;20%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$545,501 or more&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$613,701 or more&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$306,851 or more&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"&gt;$579,601 or more&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income, according to federal income tax brackets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to reduce or avoid capital gains taxes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hold on&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever possible, hold an asset for longer than a year to qualify for the long-term capital gains tax rate because it's significantly lower than the short-term capital gains rate for most assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use tax-advantaged accounts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include 401(k) plans, IRAs and 529 college savings accounts, in which the investments grow tax-free or tax-deferred. That means a capital gains tax doesn't have to be paid if a person sells investments within these accounts. Roth IRAs and 529 accounts, in particular, have big tax advantages. If a person follows the account rules, they can withdraw money from those accounts tax-free. With traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, money grows tax-deferred, then your taxes are paid when distributions are taken in retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rebalance with dividends&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than reinvest dividends in the investment that paid them, rebalance by putting the money into underperforming investments. Typically, a person would rebalance by selling securities that are doing well and putting that money into those that are underperforming. Using dividends to invest in underperforming assets allows a person to avoid selling strong performers and thus avoid the capital gains that would come from selling securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Look into tax-loss harvesting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IRS taxes net capital gain, which is simply a person's total long- or short-term capital gains (investments sold for a profit) minus the corresponding long- or short-term total capital losses (investments sold at a loss). The strategic practice of selling off specific assets at a loss to offset gains is called tax-loss harvesting. This strategy has many rules and isn't right for everyone, but it can help reduce taxes by lowering the amount of taxable gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a person's net capital loss exceeds net capital gains, they can also offset ordinary income by up to $3,000, or $1,500 for those married filing separately. Any additional losses can be carried forward to future years to offset capital gains or up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use the home sales exclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a person sold a house the previous year, they may be able to exclude a portion of the gains from that sale on their taxes. To qualify, a person must have owned their home and used it as your main residence for at least two years in the five-year period before they sell. They also must not have excluded another home from capital gains in the two-year period before the home sale. If a person meets those rules, they can exclude up to $250,000 in gains from a home sale if they're single, or up to $500,000 if they're married filing jointly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consider a financial adviser&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working with a financial adviser can help a person know how and when to take advantages of smart tax strategies in ways that are best for their specific financial situation and goals.&lt;/p&gt;",

The deduction helps filers claim certain taxes they've already, paid like sales and property taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First introduced in 2017, under Trump's first presidential term, the SALT deduction only applies if filers itemize — not those who take the standard deduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SALT cap will increase annually by 1% until 2029, after which it'll revert back to its 2017 cap of $10,000, or $5,000 for married filing separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, the cap increases by $400 to $40,400, or $20,200 for married couples filing separately — amounts that would apply when filing by April 15, 2027. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full deduction phases out for filers with modified adjusted gross income of more than $500,000, or $250,000 for those married filing jointly.  Similar to the deduction, the phaseout levels increase by 1% annually through 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in 2026, the value of itemized deductions for those in the 37% tax bracket will be capped at 35%, or about 35 cents for every dollar they deduct, according to Fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Gallegos, tax partner at accounting and consulting firm Porte Brown's Elgin office, said taxpayers should confirm they're not subject to the alternative minimum tax and that Illinois properly credits their prepayments before they accelerate such payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tax-advantaged investment for kids&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For American citizens who have a baby between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, the federal government will contribute $1,000 into a 530A account, also known as a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/personal-finance/2025/12/02/trump-accounts-kids-dell-6billion-investment-stock-market\"   &gt;Trump Account&lt;/a&gt;, on the child’s behalf. The account is similar to an individual retirement account and is expected to be available starting in July. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families, employers and others may contribute up to $5,000 annually in after-tax money to each child’s account until they turn 18. From ages 18 to 30, the child can withdraw the funds tax-free as long as they're used for higher education, job training, a first-time home purchase, starting a small business or certain workforce expenses. After age 30, the money is taxed as ordinary income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beverly Moran, tax law expert and professor emerita at Vanderbilt University, said low-income families will come up short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My message would be, ‘Don’t be fooled by the hype,’” Moran said. “[The account] has been billed as good for working Americans. Mostly, it’s not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because most families don’t have an extra $5,000 to save for that long, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moran said it’s vital that low-income working families also see their new reality under the tax bill: tighter eligibility, smaller benefits and greater costs in time, expenses and recordkeeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Expenses for 529 plans&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan that helps families plan for future educational expenses. Contributions grow tax-free, and withdrawals are also tax-free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the passage of last year's sweeping budget bill, the plan allowed qualified educational expenses of up to $10,000 per year, per beneficiary for K-12 tuition, certain apprenticeship programs registered with the U.S. Department of Labor and student loan repayments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to tuition, qualified expenses included fees, books, school supplies, campus food and meal plans, technology used for schoolwork and certain room and board costs for students enrolled at least half time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new law, families have expanded flexibility. The most significant change is that families can now withdraw $20,000 versus $10,000, as of Jan. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also expanded the list of qualified expenses, which took effect July 2025. This includes online education materials; costs for tutoring provided outside the home; fees for standardized tests, Advanced Placement exams and college admissions; educational therapy for students with disabilities; and dual enrollment fees for postsecondary programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[The] 529 plans have quietly become one of the most flexible planning tools for families, but the rules are technical, and missteps can trigger taxes or penalties,” Gallegos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Senior tax deduction&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taxpayers ages 65 and older can claim an additional $6,000 deduction on their tax returns. The federal write-off takes effect for returns filed in April and expires in tax year 2028.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single filers with an income of $75,000 may claim the entire $6,000 additional deduction. Joint filers can deduct up to $12,000 so long as they both meet the age requirement and have a shared modified adjusted gross income of $150,000 or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deduction phases out for filers with a modified adjusted gross income over $75,000, or $150,000 for joint filers. Taxpayers can't claim the deduction if their MAGI is $175,000 or more, and $250,000 or more for joint filers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldburn Maynard Jr., law professor at the University of Connecticut, said it’s important to note that withdrawing a large amount from your retirement savings could reduce or eliminate your ability to qualify for the senior deduction. That’s because retirement monies count toward modified adjusted gross income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maynard’s scholarship on race-neutral tax policy argues that temporary, income-limited senior deductions perpetuate using small tax breaks and disguise an underlying structure that disadvantages lower-income seniors of color and those who rely on retirement withdrawals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Gallegos, certified public accountant and partner at Porte Brown, said now is the time to review ways you can qualify for the lower tax brackets and bigger deductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the earlier you pinpoint the rules, the more time you'll have to use free online tools and resources offered by the IRS and companies like Intuit and TurboTax. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;No tax provisions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The much-talked about \"no tax on tips\" provision allows some taxpayers and self-employed individuals in &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/treasury-irs-issue-guidance-listing-occupations-where-workers-customarily-and-regularly-receive-tips-under-the-one-big-beautiful-bill\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;qualified occupations&lt;/a&gt; — like servers, bartenders, salon workers, personal trainers and gig workers — to deduct their tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A big downside, Moran said, is that the new rules will require many more workers to keep their own detailed financial records, starting in the 2026 tax year. That’s because the new rules lowered the threshold for which businesses must issue forms for non-employee pay, called 1099s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That puts the burden on the worker to keep up with pay stubs, receipts and tip totals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people don’t keep records, don’t want to keep records or are freaked out by records,” Moran said. “It’s not an easy thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a new auto loan interest tax deduction that applies to new cars with final assembly done in the U.S. The write-off runs through 2028, and car buyers can deduct up to $10,000 a year in interest paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The new temporary deduction for qualified car loan interest only applies to the percentage of the interest associated with personal use,” Moran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another deduction on overtime rules could benefit middle-income filers. For the tax years 2026 and later, employers will be required to separately report qualified overtime compensation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deduction is up to $12,500 for the year per return, or $25,000 for joint filers. But for occupations like police officers, firefighters and hospital and construction workers, who regularly work overtime, they should pay attention because the tax benefit phases out if a filer's modified adjusted gross income is more than $150,000, or $300,000 for joint filers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now is the time to step back and ask: What does your income look like for the year? Your W-2, Social Security, other sources,” Gallegos said. “Do you qualify for these credits and deductions? A lot of people miss a lot of deductions. Get your arms around it early.”&lt;/p&gt;",

For the most part, it's a very tax-advantaged legislation with certain tax cuts being made permanent and others expanded.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill introduces a number of tax policy goals that Trump touted on the campaign trail. It establishes deductions such as the so-called \"no tax on tips\" and \"no tax on overtime,\" as well as deductions for seniors and qualifying new car loans. And it temporarily raises the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the act includes more than just tax cuts. It makes spending cuts to certain federal programs, as well as boosts spending for some agencies. Changes include an estimated $170 billion toward immigration enforcement, more than $150 billion toward military spending, phasing out clean energy credits like the electric vehicle tax credit, requiring states to pay more for food aid programs and cutting Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The megabill will upend household finances, but it will also provide more clarity for financial planning, financial advisers have said. One example is it extended the current tax rates and brackets, which were enacted in 2017 and set to expire last year. It also adds several new stipulations that could be beneficial for certain professions, such as teachers, coaches and hospitality workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What’s new for taxpayers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Illinois residents, the most significant change is the increase of the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction from $10,000 to $40,000, according to Scott Neubauer, a financial adviser at Wisdom Investments in Hoffman Estates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given our state’s consistently high property taxes, that’s a notable amount of relief for many homeowners,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher deduction took effect in 2025, with an increase of 1% per year through 2029. It'll revert to $10,000 if further legislation isn't enacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the revision, many taxpayers opted to forego itemized deductions, leading most to take the standard deduction, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families are in line to benefit from an expanded child tax credit, new child savings accounts, adoption tax credit and broader eligibility for 529 plans, which offer tax advantages and other incentives for future education costs such as tuition, expenses and student loan repayments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child tax credit was increased for 2025 by $200, making the credit $2,200 per qualifying child for parents or guardians with an annual income of less than $200,000, or $400,000 if filing jointly. And the value of the credit adjusts for inflation in subsequent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now the child and taxpayer — or couple, if filing jointly — must have a Social Security number to claim the credit. The requirement would make more than 4.5 million children in the U.S. ineligible, the vast majority of whom are citizens, because one or both of their parents lack a Social Security number, according to the National Immigration Forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The budget bill also creates so-called &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/personal-finance/2025/12/02/trump-accounts-kids-dell-6billion-investment-stock-market\"   &gt;“Trump Accounts,”&lt;/a&gt; which function like a traditional individual retirement account. Those born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028, will receive a one-time $1,000 deposit from the U.S. Department of Treasury. The funds are invested in low-cost stock index funds, which mirror the performance of an index such as the S&amp;amp;P 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents and others can contribute up to $5,000 annually until the child turns 18, starting in July. An employer may contribute up to $2,500 toward the cap. State and local governments and private charities will be allowed to make broad contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parent contributions are after-tax, and the money isn't taxable when it's withdrawn, according to Fidelity. Any earnings on the contributions, however, are taxed when they're withdrawn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, new tax rules will affect some Illinois seniors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enhanced senior deduction allows taxpayers 65 and older to deduct an additional $6,000 from 2025 through 2028. The benefit phases out for single taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income between $75,000 and $175,000, and for married joint filers, between $150,000 and $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deduction, which primarily benefits those in the 10%, 12% and 22% marginal tax brackets, creates a new wrinkle in tax planning, according to Anthony Pellegrino, founder and CEO of Oakbrook Terrace-based Goldstone Financial Group, which evaluates Roth conversions for clients in the 22% bracket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In many cases, the long-term savings from completing a Roth conversion still outweigh the value of the new deduction, but this will now require case-by-case analysis to avoid unintentionally reducing or eliminating the deduction due to MAGI increases,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tax filers and planners will have to evaluate whether paying taxes now via a conversion is more beneficial, particularly if individual tax rates in retirement are expected to be the same or higher than current rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The White House estimates the federal senior deduction will benefit nearly 34 million Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other federal provisions offered in the bill include deductions on overtime pay and qualified tips. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the tax years between 2025 and 2028, single filers can deduct up to $12,500 of qualified overtime pay, or $25,000 for joint filers. The deduction phases out for those earning over $150,000 for individuals and $300,000 for joint filers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Employees and self-employed workers may be able to deduct qualified tips. Workers in certain tipped occupations can deduct a maximum of $25,000. For self-employed workers, it must not exceed their net income. The deduction also phases out for filers earning more than $150,000 for individuals and $300,000 for joint filers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Carve-outs for the wealthy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Households earning $460,000 to $1.1 million get an estimated $21,000 tax cut, boosting their after-tax income by 4.4%, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Policy Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middle-income filers who make $67,000 to $119,000 can expect a tax cut of about $1,800, on their 2026 return, raising their after-tax income by 2.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, low-income taxpayers making less than $35,000 will receive a $150 tax cut, or less than 1% of after-tax income, similar to the rates in the 2017 tax legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top income tax rate was expected to increase from 37% to 39.6% this year, following the expiration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but the new budget bill made the 37% rate permanent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard deduction also increased for the 2025 tax year to $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly. The amounts are also adjusted for inflation each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Extensions ate up most of the budget [bill] for tax changes,” said Ed Lyon, a Cincinnati-based tax consultant who worked on Capitol Hill during the 1986 Tax Reform Act. “That was the primary goal of the bill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the bill definitely favors high-income taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Low-income Americans typically don’t pay enough federal income tax to see significant changes,” Lyon said. “And middle-class taxpayers typically don’t itemize, which means they miss most of the new breaks too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill also increased the estate, gift and generation-skipping transfer tax exemptions, which started Jan. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For wealthy taxpayers, this means the amount that can be passed on to heirs — free from federal estate tax — is now $15 million per individual and $30 million for a married couple, with annual adjustments for inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the legislation, the exemptions would've reverted from last year's $13.9 million cap to about $7 million this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“High net worth individuals have a reason to celebrate,” Brad Werner, partner at the Chicago office of Milwaukee-based Wipfli and Wipfli Advisory, said. “For families and advisers, this is a chance to review estate plans in light of the favorable amount of exemption.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who wins, who loses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The megabill solidifies some of Trump’s long-held goals that were championed for years, like the elimination, or phaseout, of several clean energy tax credits for electric vehicles and residential installations — key tenets of former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the tax cuts benefit high earners while the bill reduces spending on safety net programs, often beneficial to low-income households. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to certain social programs, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, will become more restricted with new work requirements and other enrollment verification, tax experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Congressional Budget Office projects the number of uninsured Americans will increase by more than 10 million by 2034 due to cuts in the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicaid, the joint state and federal program that helps low-income participants cover medical costs, will see more than $900 billion in cuts over the next decade, the office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the SALT deduction changes, the biggest winners are middle- and high-income earners, receiving between $150,000 and $500,000, according to Tal Binder, CEO of Gelt, a Miami-based tax platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The larger policy question now is how the government will ultimately fund these measures and manage the growing national debt because tax reductions are only sustainable when paired with responsible spending,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the bill, the federal deficit is expected to soar to about $3.4 trillion over 10 years, as tax cuts are only partially offset by spending reductions, according to the Congressional Budget Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago-based Heather Hunt-Ruddy, who heads the central region of Wells Fargo Advisors, said \"permanent pertains only to the features of the current legislation. ... Any of them can be changed with new legislation in the years ahead, with likely shifts in the congressional power balance between Republicans and Democrats.”&lt;/p&gt;",

Above-the-line deductions reduce a filer’s adjusted gross income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This change follows a temporary pandemic benefit that allowed a $300 deduction for charitable giving. For the 2021 tax year, about 47 million households claimed the temporary deduction for donations totaling around $18 billion, according to the Nonprofit Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump's new legislation now opens the door for more people to claim the tax break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That's a real incentive for people to donate to these charitable organizations,” Rob Pasquesi, certified public accountant and founder of Pasquesi Partners, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tighter limits for high-earners, large donors&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only charitable giving above 0.5% of adjusted gross income is deductible for those who itemize, effective in the 2026 tax year, or returns due April 2027. For example, a couple with an AGI of $300,000 could only deduct donations in excess of $1,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-income taxpayers in the 37% tax bracket will also see their federal tax benefit from deductions capped at roughly 35%, meaning they will not receive dollar-for-dollar value from their charitable gifts. So a high-income filer’s $1,000 donation would receive a $350 deduction for the 2026 tax year, instead of the current $370.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new tax bill also cemented a 2017 rule that allowed itemizers to claim cash donations up to 60% of their AGI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the rules, small or distributed donations may lose value, while large lump-sum gifts may need more strategic timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are some small changes with real impacts for those that contribute a lot every year,” Pasquesi said. “I always advise my clients to get in the mindset of thinking about taxes at least once a quarter during the year versus once a year when they’re due. There are a lot of strategies to minimize what they pay in taxes later on, and it relieves the stress of starting the new year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Scholarship donation credit&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in the 2027 tax year, taxpayers may claim a nonrefundable credit of up to $1,700, or 100% of the gift, whichever is less, for donations to qualified K–12 scholarship-granting organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the scholarship donation credit available next year, supporting private school scholarships may now yield a federal tax credit under the new tax package, &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48724\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;according to regulations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Maximizing giving in 2026&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new tax provisions in effect, donors have an opportunity to make their generosity work harder — both for the causes they care about and for their own financial planning. Experts said the key is timing and strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure taxpayers get the most out of their giving, donors can utilize a strategy called bunching, Gallegos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can take what you would give over the next two to three years to your organization and give it now. Instead of $1,000 each year for three years, give $3,000,” Gallegos said. “And you avoid that half-percent haircut.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who want flexibility, donor-advised funds offer a way to make a lump-sum contribution now while distributing grants to charities over time. However, contributions to donor-advised funds don’t qualify for an above-the-line deduction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Donors should start planning early,” James Provenza, an attorney who counsels clients on planned giving, said. “You can’t wait until the very last minute because there’s always processing time for these donations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High earners may also want to look beyond charitable gifts and consider ways to lower their adjusted gross income. Maximizing retirement contributions or increasing pretax payments to health savings accounts and student loans can soften the impact of the new 0.5% floor on deductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to qualifying for the new above-the-line deduction, simplicity matters: Only direct cash donations to public charities count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For donors passionate about education, planning ahead could pay off. Eligible donations made in 2026 may position donors to claim the 2027 scholarship credit, adding another layer of tax benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoughtful timing, strategic giving and awareness of new credits can help donors make the most of their philanthropy, Gallegos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anytime we have new tax legislation ... there’s an unknown out there, and I think it makes people nervous,” Gallegos said. “At the end of the day, you’re going to find that a lot of these tax provisions can have some great benefits for people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-ed0000\" name=\"module-ed0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips for maximizing your tax benefits from charitable giving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bunching&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Consolidating several years worth of charitable contributions into a single, larger gift is a strategy known as bunching. It can help donors clear deduction thresholds and maximize tax benefits. For those who want flexibility, donor-advised funds offer a way to make a lump-sum contribution now while distributing grants to charities over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lower your adjusted gross income&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To soften the impact of the 0.5% floor, high earners can reduce their adjusted gross income by maximizing retirement account contributions and increasing pretax contributions to health savings accounts or student loan payments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Donate cash directly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By donating cash directly to public charities, taxpayers can be eligible for the new above-the-line deduction. Having an above-the-line deduction allows a filer to reduce their adjusted gross income.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leverage the scholarship credit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you support K–12 education through donations, plan ahead. Eligible donations made in 2026 could position donors to claim the new credit next year, enhancing their tax benefits.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

It was on a Friday night, there was no television broadcast, the mayor did not attend, and none of the players had a college scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the talent level and overall profile of Public League basketball is down, the honesty level is up. This may have been the first city title game in a decade or more in which all of the players actually lived in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chicago Public Schools has recently been cracking down on residency violations and unlike in the past, there was no situation where everyone in the building was fully aware that a player lived in Oak Park or the South Suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curie coach Mike Oliver wasn’t taking the bait when I asked him about that issue after the game. But he had plenty to say about the makeup of his team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most Curie kids travel 30 or 40 minutes away from home, and they are all Chicago kids,” Oliver said. “Justin Oliver’s dad played for me. Gabriel Taylor’s dad played for me. Kendall Holliday’s uncle played for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curie never appeared to be one of the major offenders when it came to using suburban stars. Oliver’s teams have regularly been a family affair, made up of players with connections to his long-time successful program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Condors were heavy favorites to win the city, and they delivered. The emergence of 6-8 senior Keith Collins as a rim protector, rebounder and scorer has given Curie’s state title chances a major shot in the arm. With Collins and Holliday, the Condors have two impact players to battle in the post against the bigs at DePaul Prep and Benet and would have a size advantage against Warren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Perfection achieved&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaneland beat Ottawa and LaSalle-Peru this week to finish up the regular season undefeated at 30-0. The Knights haven’t played a particularly challenging schedule; that’s why they are still ranked No. 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But strength of schedule is out the window now. Kaneland is talented enough to win Class 3A. Senior Marshawn Cocroft is an experienced, dynamic guard that leads a group which includes 6-9 junior Jeffrey Hassan and senior guards Jalen Carter and Connor Kimme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Super 25 updates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyons and Rich make Super 25 season debuts this week. It’s been an up and down season for the Lions, but they are playing their best basketball of the season now, winning 11 consecutive games as the playoffs arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich received a huge boost in February when star guard Jamson Coulter returned to the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senior helped lead the Raptors to the state finals last season but has been out with health issues all season. Rich was competitive without Coulter, but with him back they are a real contender in the Class 4A Joliet West sectional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;York returns to the Super 25 this week, and Mount Carmel, Hillcrest and Hyde Park drop out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Super 25 high school basketball rankings for Feb. 22, 2026&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;With record and last week’s ranking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.

I love my teammates. It’s unbelievable. The USA Hockey brotherhood is so strong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hughes' goal off the rush off a pass from Zach Werenski 1:41 into 3-on-3 OT sent players into a wild celebration as Canada's entire team watched from the bench. Werenski and Matthew Tkachuk carried a Johnny Gaudreau No. 13 around the ice as &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/johnny-gaudreau-olympics-team-usa-43c05ba80d4c3f51c4a4b94285c63038\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;the latest tribute&lt;/a&gt; to the beloved player who was killed along with his brother in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gaudreau's parents, Guy and Jay, his widow, Meredith, and their oldest children were in attendance. It was John Jr.'s second birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hellebuyck was by far the best player on the ice, stopping 41 of the 42 shots he faced as Canada tilted the ice toward him. He made the save of the tournament by getting his stick on the puck on a shot from Devon Toews in the third period, then minutes later denied Macklin Celebrini on a breakaway — something he also did to Connor McDavid earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Unbelievable game by Hellebuyck,\" Hughes said. “He was our best player by a mile.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was only fitting the Americans needed to go through Canada, their northern neighbor that beat them at the 4 Nations Face-Off a year ago and has won every international competition over the past 16 years that featured the world's best players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winning a fast-paced, riveting game that was full of big hits and plenty of post-whistle altercations, the U.S. got a goal from Matt Boldy 6 minutes in and led until Cale Makar tied it late in the second period. Hellebuyck and the penalty kill was a perfect 18 for 18 at the Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t even believe this,” Hughes said. “I mean it’s such an unbelievable game, USA-Canada. Such a good game. There’s so many great players. We’re a great team. That’s exactly how we wanted it to go. We’re underdogs to Canada, (but we) beat them. It could have gone either way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. finally came through after generations of churning out talent from the grassroots level like a production line. All but two of the 25 players on the team went through USA Hockey’s National Team Development Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That group of 23 includes captain Auston Matthews, the top line of Brady and Matthew Tkachuk and Jack Eichel, and the second set of brothers, Jack and Quinn Hughes. Much of the team played together either at the program, under-18s, the world junior championship or some combination of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. winning silenced criticism of general manager Bill Guerin and his management group &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://apnews.com/article/usa-canada-olympic-rosters-gold-8393d8e4b3462ad8dd7bfe4a92382f64\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;choosing a roster&lt;/a&gt; full of experienced veteran players to fill specific roles and leaving four of the top 10 American goal-scorers in the NHL this season at home. Some decisions were no-doubters, like coach Mike Sullivan giving the net to Hellebuyck, who was the best goalie in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada, back-to-back Olympic champions in 2010 and ’14 and winners of three of the first five, fell short while playing without injured captain Sidney Crosby. The 38-year-old two-time gold medalist and three-time Stanley Cup champion left the quarterfinal game against Czechia and sat out the semifinal game against Finland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McDavid, the widely considered best player in the world who wore the “C” in Crosby’s absence, suffered another devastating defeat on the doorstep of a title. He and the Edmonton Oilers have lost to Matthew Tkachuk and the Florida Panthers in the Stanley Cup Final each of the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;",

Steinberg here&lt;/a&gt;, with a word about our new neighbors: the robots. Yeah, I'm talking AI. Artificial intelligence. All the sci-fi buzzwords that used to belong to Isaac Asimov and now clog your Twitter feed.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Does that sound like my voice?\" I asked readers, sincerely aghast. \"Kill me now.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-a90000\" name=\"module-a90000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Opinion bug&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last February, I checked up on how AI had advanced by putting the same request to Gemini 2.0. &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2025/02/04/ai-computers-learning-internet-writing-newspapers-technology\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;The result was smoother, &lt;/a&gt;better, and — what really scared me — it provided a spot-on critique of what my writing is like unbidden, noting my \"casual and conversational tone\" and \"cynical and skeptical outlook\" seasoned with \"A touch of self-depreciation.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who needs self-depreciation anymore? Not when reality depreciates us so regularly, with technology and the entire culture joining forces in a feverish drive to utterly moot what real people, such as myself, do for a living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now February has come again and is fast waning. So if I want to keep the tradition alive — the way things are going, there might not be another February — time to gird my loins and approach AI, bigger than ever, filling actual, real world jobs, so — cue the self-depreciation: I thought I'd lob Gemini 3.0 the same slow pitch and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four seconds after I clicked the button, it offered a solid headline: \"The Ghost in the Machine is Just Us\" and a column beginning:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I stepped onto the Red Line this morning and watched a young man staring into his phone, his thumb flicking upward with the rhythmic precision of a piston. He wasn’t looking at the scenery — which, let’s be honest, is mostly the backside of crumbling brick three-flats anyway — he was arguing with a computer. Or rather, he was asking a computer to write a poem for his girlfriend because he, like most of us when faced with a blank page and the weight of human expectation, had found himself utterly empty.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK folks, using only that big, slow, imperfect lump of pink wetware between your ears, can anyone please tell me the problem with that paragraph? Not a subtle drawback either. I hope. Honestly, the flaw should reach out of the page and slap you hard across the face. Because — not to pressure you — if it doesn't, it truly might be time for me to go out to Lake Michigan, settle myself on an ice floe and wait for spring, to be carried out to that Great Newsroom in the Sky, to share a lager with H.L. Mencken and Sydney J. Harris ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anybody?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not true. I didn't step out onto the Red Line — indeed, would never use that phrase if I did, but name the specific station — there was no young man, no phone, no nascent poem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, Gemini could have responded the same if I asked it to pinpoint the biggest problem with AI: firehosing a constant stream of fictitious slop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's Fauxberg column continues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The scolds will tell you this is the end. They’ll say that Artificial Intelligence is the final nail in the coffin of the human spirit, a cold, silicon reaper coming for our jobs, our art, and our very ability to think.... We are a species that delights in fearing our own shadows, especially when those shadows are cast by a new kind of light.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is true. Every new technology cues the funeral rites, back to Robert Louis Stevenson explaining how gaslight had ruined the romance of London. Don't install the telephone in the nursery — children could catch infectious diseases over the wires! Radio would cause cows to stop giving milk and birds to fall out the sky dead. Television would erode children's minds. Cell phones would give us brain cancer. AI will destroy mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me the key question is this: Will we continue to care if things are true anymore? Must the news have actually happened? Or can it be a scary, or funny or diverting story some machine tells to lull us to sleep? Are those Chinese robots &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; doing complicated kung fu moves?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn't need AI to undermine the value of truth. Look at who we picked to run the country. Twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see technology changing; what we don't always see is ourselves changing along with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could only use part of the quite good column Gemini 3.0 wrote. But I saved it for my files. After all, I'd written the thing, sort of.&lt;/p&gt;",

August Strindberg's “Miss Julie” checks all those boxes, packing them into a sometimes squirm-inducing class conflict that ends with a shocking denouement that’s either tragic, karmic or some twisted version of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court Theatre Associate Artistic Director Gabrielle Randle-Bent’s 90-minute staging doesn’t move Strindberg’s three-person drama from late 19th-century Sweden. But this is no period piece. Randle-Bent brings it to the Hyde Park theater with unsettling immediacy. The cast creates a world of discord, tension and volatility as an aristocrat is pitted against a valet in a struggle for power, control, love and self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translated with elegance and impact by Harry G. Carlson, “Miss Julie,” lives at the trip-wire intersection of gender and class. Both come into play when the aristocrat Miss Julie (Mi Kang) insistently and drunkenly tries to seduce her father’s valet, Jean (Kelvin Roston Jr.) on Midsummer’s Eve. The consequences are extreme, the bloody decapitation of a pet finch the least of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RatingCard Enhancement\" data-module data-rating=\"3.5\"  data-align-center&gt;\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RatingCard-title\"&gt;\n        ‘Miss Julie’\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    &lt;div class=\"RatingCard-content\"&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n        &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star\"&gt;\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-full\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=\"RatingCard-star-half\"&gt;\n        &lt;svg class=\"\"&gt;\n            &lt;use xlink:href=\"#icon-star\"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\n    &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-ba0000\" name=\"module-ba0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;When:&lt;/b&gt; Through March 8&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where:&lt;/b&gt; Court Theatre, 5535 S.

That tracks: The plot is essentially a battle between aristocrats and working people, both struggling for agency and primacy. It’s a survival-of-the-fittest story, set not in the wild but in a bastion of domesticity — a well-appointed kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road from kitchen to perdition runs through the course of Sweden’s Midsummer’s Eve celebrations. The revels are offstage, but they’re no match for the fireworks detonating in the manor where Miss Julie lives with her father, a count. In addition to Miss Julie and Jean, the stabbing points of the manor triangle include Jean’s fiancee Kristine (Rebecca Spence), a cook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randle-Bent directs her ensemble with blistering impact. At first, you think you know Miss Julie. Kang initially shows us a tipsy, clueless, rich girl who, like Gatsby, thoughtlessly imperils people without the protection of money or social status. She’s also the worst kind of condescending: “It must be terrible to be poor,” she tells Jean in one of many cringe-worthy bits of dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-490000\" name=\"image-490000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3d5e76f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+472/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Fb5%2F811c833e4960bea314a854468266%2Fphoto-of-kelvin-roston-jr-mi-kang-and-rebecca-spence-by-michael-brosilow.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3db29d4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+472/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Fb5%2F811c833e4960bea314a854468266%2Fphoto-of-kelvin-roston-jr-mi-kang-and-rebecca-spence-by-michael-brosilow.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8551b51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+472/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Fb5%2F811c833e4960bea314a854468266%2Fphoto-of-kelvin-roston-jr-mi-kang-and-rebecca-spence-by-michael-brosilow.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Photo of Kelvin Roston Jr., Mi Kang, and Rebecca Spence by Michael Brosilow.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8551b51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+472/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Fb5%2F811c833e4960bea314a854468266%2Fphoto-of-kelvin-roston-jr-mi-kang-and-rebecca-spence-by-michael-brosilow.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0f8f636/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+472/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Fb5%2F811c833e4960bea314a854468266%2Fphoto-of-kelvin-roston-jr-mi-kang-and-rebecca-spence-by-michael-brosilow.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8551b51/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+472/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F65%2Fb5%2F811c833e4960bea314a854468266%2Fphoto-of-kelvin-roston-jr-mi-kang-and-rebecca-spence-by-michael-brosilow.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Miss Julie (Kang) and Jean (Roston Jr.), the manor triangle includes Jean’s fiance Kristine (Rebecca Spence), a cook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Brosilow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to making Jean hers, Miss Julie wants to abandon her privileged life, or at least believes that’s what she wants. She’s fresh from a humiliating breakup that involved public screaming and a broken riding crop, and although she insists she’s fine, her obsessive stabbing of the kitchen table with a cleaver says otherwise. Ditto pressing her palm to a burning stovetop. Kang goes deeper and deeper until Miss Julie is in a lightless abyss of her own making. The velocity of her unraveling is more than a little terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Roston’s capable hands, Jean’s attempts to fend off Miss Julie’s advances struggle alongside his ambition to transcend his station in life. Roston has equal finesse with comedy and ferocity, instilling both with the dignity of somebody who is well aware of his worth, even when he’s furiously scraping the muck from the count’s riding boots. (The count is never seen. Tellingly, his boots stand in the kitchen like silent sentries throughout.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roston has a gift for withering zingers. When their roles are fleetingly reversed and Jean issues a command to Miss Julie, she plaintively asks why he’s being so unkind. “Orders are never kind,” he tells her. “Now you know.” It’s a mic drop moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-af0000\" name=\"image-af0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/01b96c3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+590/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd3%2F23%2F1e62175447cf9f53546232d9f427%2Fphoto-of-mi-kang-and-kelvin-roston-jr-by-michael-brosilow.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6fa3e9d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+590/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd3%2F23%2F1e62175447cf9f53546232d9f427%2Fphoto-of-mi-kang-and-kelvin-roston-jr-by-michael-brosilow.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/17b1604/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+590/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd3%2F23%2F1e62175447cf9f53546232d9f427%2Fphoto-of-mi-kang-and-kelvin-roston-jr-by-michael-brosilow.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Mi Kang and Kelvin Roston Jr. star in “Miss Julie” in Court Theatre’s staging of the August Strindberg play.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/17b1604/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+590/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd3%2F23%2F1e62175447cf9f53546232d9f427%2Fphoto-of-mi-kang-and-kelvin-roston-jr-by-michael-brosilow.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/08396a8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+590/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd3%2F23%2F1e62175447cf9f53546232d9f427%2Fphoto-of-mi-kang-and-kelvin-roston-jr-by-michael-brosilow.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/17b1604/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7818x4388+0+590/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd3%2F23%2F1e62175447cf9f53546232d9f427%2Fphoto-of-mi-kang-and-kelvin-roston-jr-by-michael-brosilow.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mi Kang and Kelvin Roston Jr. star in “Miss Julie” in Court Theatre’s staging of the August Strindberg play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Brosilow&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Kristine, Spence navigates the fine line between sanctimonious and sympathetic. She also powers several wild, wordless cooking and baking scenes, swirling flour, frying kidneys and kneading bread with an intensity that borders on mania. As the kitchen heats up, Willow James’ sound design crescendos from harmonious strings to dissonant percussion while Keith Parham’s lights blink and stutter. The sequences are eardrum-rattling, retina-searing and hypnotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Culbert’s set design is beautifully Swedish with pale wood dominating a kitchen under a bower of herbs, evergreens and lilacs hanging like a verdant crown over the players. What doesn’t work in the set is the misguided voile scrim that surrounds the kitchen. It blurs both performers and the set’s gorgeous interior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve seen the 2019 horror film “Midsommar,” you know things can get weird in the Nordic lands around the solstice. More than a century earlier, Strindberg used the specter of the midnight sun to frame an out-of-joint world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweden had counts and servants. We have oligarchs and minimum wage. Who survives and who goes the way of Miss Julie’s finch is the question at the root of “Miss Julie.” Court’s production asks it with fiery urgency.&lt;/p&gt;",

Hughes and Werenski play hockey, of course. Dent is a UCLA point guard, though the way he raced the length of the court Saturday night to upset &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/college-sports\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;No. 10 Illinois&lt;/a&gt; 95-94 at the buzzer in overtime, he might want to give Olympic sprinting a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much as Canada’s Cale Makar and Nathan MacKinnon will regret their flat-footed skating while being beaten to loose pucks on the decisive play, the Illini — from coach Brad Underwood on down — will review Dent’s 4.9-second sprint for a layup and wonder why no one made more of an effort to stop the ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Letting him get all the way to the rim was not in the game plan,” Underwood said afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;DONOVAN DENT WINS IT FOR UCLA 😱 &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/3XkFpKVk2x\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3XkFpKVk2x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; NCAA March Madness (@MarchMadnessMBB) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarchMadnessMBB/status/2025416664599134422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 22, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s assuming there was a game plan involving defense at all. The Illini (22-6) blew a 23-point first-half lead against the Bruins (18-9), who were coming off back-to-back blowout losses to Michigan and Michigan State. After going up 33-10 on a Ben Humrichous three nearly 11 minutes into the first half, the Illini gave up a galling 85 points the rest of the way. They made Dent, a senior transfer from New Mexico who finished with 15 assists, look like Lonzo Ball, Darren Collison, Baron Davis and Walt Hazzard all rolled into one — with a dash of Tyus Edney, who went the length of the court in 4.8 seconds to beat Missouri in the 1995 NCAA Tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much is made of Underwood’s highly efficient offense, which is humming because everybody on the floor willingly moves the ball and can shoot. But the tallest team in college basketball attempted 42 threes against the Bruins — making only 13 — was outscored 38-30 in the paint despite dominating on the offensive glass and lumbered fruitlessly at the defensive end. Will the Illini’s ongoing susceptibility to quick guards be a fatal flaw in the postseason?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought we got very lackadaisical on the defensive side,” Underwood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did. But there also aren’t any Ayo Dosunmu, Dee Brown or Kendall Gill types — all-out burners and defensive game changers on the perimeter — in this crew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Underwood said, “We’re right there. We’re as good as anybody in the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Illini’s four Big Ten losses have come by a total of nine points, with three of the games going to overtime and two of them — Nebraska being the other one — decided on baskets made at the buzzer. With a little more luck, a very good record could be even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a good bit of buzz when the NCAA selection committee unveiled its tournament seeding as of Saturday and the Illini were on the 2 line as the seventh overall seed. Ahead of them, in order, were Michigan, Duke, Arizona, Iowa State, UConn and Houston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who watched Duke beat Michigan 68-63 and Arizona top Houston 73-66 later that day knows those games were beyond-fierce defensive battles, and that any of those six powerhouses mentioned above would salivate at the chance to tangle with the Illini offense in March. If there’s anything separating those teams and the Illini, it clearly starts with a “D” and ends with a clang off the rim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guess who the Illini face next? Michigan in a rare Friday-night game (7 p.m., Fox 32) in Champaign. It’ll be bonkers. The home team’s offense will give it a pretty good shot, one would expect. But offense alone won’t cut it, not against the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;",

The surprise announcement for the Chicago dates (including a second show Sunday) came a couple weeks ago and sold out within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t Clark Jr.’s first time at Legends. That happened about two decades ago, before he was launched into the mainstream at Eric Clapton’s Crossroads Guitar Festival in 2010 and before the Grammy awards and the co-signs with John Legend and Foo Fighters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Saturday night sure looked different with packed-in tables and standing-room-only sections clogged with fans clamoring to get up close to Clark Jr.’s frenetic fret playing and rock swagger that have led to his reputation as this generation’s Hendrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a dream for real,” the guitarist said, recalling the early days when he hallucinated about moments like these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Soon after I saw Buddy in Austin in this little spot called La Zona Rosa … I got his ‘Heavy Love’ record and a little bandanna with polka dots [Guy’s signature], and I put that on my wall with some thumbtacks,” he said. “Up next to that was a poster of B.B. King, The Vaughan Brothers and Michael Jackson. That was my room, that was my inspiration. … I drove up here 20-something years ago and got to play. Fast forward to now, I’m back here, baby, and it feels good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-7d0000\" name=\"image-7d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/258a629/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7086x3977+0+375/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F39%2F15%2Ff8d6a9b94570877feb5205579d6c%2Fgaryclarkjr-260223-17.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a4999ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7086x3977+0+375/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F39%2F15%2Ff8d6a9b94570877feb5205579d6c%2Fgaryclarkjr-260223-17.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b20ef0e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7086x3977+0+375/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F39%2F15%2Ff8d6a9b94570877feb5205579d6c%2Fgaryclarkjr-260223-17.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"Gary Clark Jr. performs Saturday at Buddy Guy’s Legends. \" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b20ef0e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7086x3977+0+375/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F39%2F15%2Ff8d6a9b94570877feb5205579d6c%2Fgaryclarkjr-260223-17.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a871c8c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7086x3977+0+375/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F39%2F15%2Ff8d6a9b94570877feb5205579d6c%2Fgaryclarkjr-260223-17.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b20ef0e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7086x3977+0+375/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F39%2F15%2Ff8d6a9b94570877feb5205579d6c%2Fgaryclarkjr-260223-17.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Clark Jr. performs Saturday at Buddy Guy’s Legends.

Not that anyone was complaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just one of his new tracks, “Maktub,” from his latest album, 2024’s “JPEG Raw,” made the cut. Instead, Clark Jr. mostly focused on material from a decade or more ago, including hits “Blak and Blu” and “Bright Lights” that put him back into the groove of where it all started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that effect, he purposely tapped one of his early allies and mentors, Austin transplant and now Chicagoan Dave Herrero, to open and join him on stage for several tracks. “I’ve known that guy since I was a teenager; I learned a lot from him,” Clark Jr. said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/music/2026/02/02/argentinian-blues-guitarist-ivan-singh-has-found-his-place-in-chicago\"   &gt;Argentinian blues guitarist Ivan Singh has found his place in Chicago&lt;/a&gt;\n                &lt;/li&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2025/04/16/sinners-movie-review-michael-b-jordan-vampires-ryan-coogler\"   &gt;Michael B.

As the club’s announcer, Johnny, astutely shared, “The blues is alive and well … this is history in the making tonight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clark Jr. felt it, too. “Well s--- … I’m satisfied. It could be over now,” he joked after the impromptu collaboratio. “We had a plan, and we’ve gone off course,” he admitted, “but we have found ourselves in some place unimaginable and incredible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gary Clark Jr. Set List for Feb. 21 show at Buddy Guy’s Legends&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maktub&lt;br&gt;Ain’t Messin’ Round&lt;br&gt;When My Train Pulls In&lt;br&gt;The Healing&lt;br&gt;My Baby’s Gone&lt;br&gt;Don’t Owe You a Thang&lt;br&gt;Feed The Babies&lt;br&gt;Five Long Years (Buddy Guy song, with Buddy Guy)&lt;br&gt;Love Her with a Feeling (Buddy Guy and Junior Wells song, with Buddy Guy)&lt;br&gt;King Bee (Buddy Guy song, with Buddy Guy)&lt;br&gt;Downhearted (B.B.

You don't have a schedule the next day. You don't have to go ‘boom, boom, boom.’ You wake up and just sit there and find something to do.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time Dach returned to Chicago a week ago for a long stretch of practices, he felt rejuvenated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I texted [Landon Slaggert] and was like, 'I'm so excited to come to the rink now,'\" he added. \"It's good to get that feeling back. It kind of feels like training camp — even the weather was a little bit nicer. You're driving in with your windows down. You get that energy. Hopefully we can take that into the last [25] games here and really showcase ourselves and make a push.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dach could personally use a strong final push, because his job security has dwindled since a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2025/09/28/blackhawks-colton-dach-nhl-roster-physicality-hits-oliver-moore\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;promising start&lt;/a&gt; and even more forward competition is currently en route to the NHL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much focus will be on the Hawks’ pending unrestricted free agents leading up to the March 6 &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/blackhawks/2026/02/21/blackhawks-nhl-trade-deadline-preview-connor-murphy-jason-dickinson-ilya-mikheyev\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;trade deadline&lt;/a&gt;, but after that, focus will shift toward the pending restricted free agents who will need new contracts after the season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s a small group headlined by Connor Bedard that also includes Dach, Kevin Korchinski, Ethan Del Mastro and Drew Commesso.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dach is the only one of those four prospects who has yet broken into the NHL full-time, but it’s up to him to maintain firm grip of his current role. That will heavily influence his contract negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has recorded nine points (three goals and six assists) and 184 hits in 52 games this season. That’s more than twice as many hits as any other Hawk, and coach Jeff Blashill praised him Friday for his consistent physicality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other parts of his game haven’t been as consistent, however, which has caused his ice time to slip from 14 minutes per game in October to 11:09 since. He was a healthy scratch several times in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"After Christmas, my game dipped a little bit, and that's where I need to showcase that consistency factor,\" Dach said. \"That's something I've been working on the last three years, trying to be consistent, and every year it's gotten a lot better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"[I’m trying to be] more responsible in their eyes, trying to be trustworthy, trying to get a little more ice time.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far during this mini February camp, Dach has skated on the fourth line with Slaggert and Nick Foligno, but that’s with Teuvo Teravainen absent at the Olympics. Teravainen's return (with a bronze medal in hand) will force somebody out. It's worth noting Dach remains waivers-exempt until next season while Slaggert will require waivers after making one more NHL appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\"&gt;\n            &lt;div class=\"ExternalContent-wrapper\" &gt;\n                &lt;div class=\"TweetUrl\"&gt;\n    &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Alex Vlasic was wearing his Team USA helmet around before Blackhawks practice to gloat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one of the equipment guys decided to make Colton Dach wear it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There wasn’t a bet, though. Vlasic: “Because I didn’t want to have to do something if we lost.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://t.co/10lCTWhXum\"&gt;pic.twitter.com/10lCTWhXum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Ben Pope (@BenPopeCST) &lt;a href=\"https://twitter.com/BenPopeCST/status/2025640412849770821?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"&gt;February 22, 2026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blashill has encouraged Dach to move his feet more, and they recently had a meeting in which Blashill showed him specific areas where that would help him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"When he skates, he’s a lot to handle, and we just have to get him skating on a more consistent basis,\" Blashill said in January. \"If we can get him [in the] habit of moving onto the puck, making sure he’s skating when he gets the puck and skating to disrupt when he doesn’t get the puck, it’ll make him that much better of a player.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawks’ newly altered defensive system, which requires wingers (like Dach) to more aggressively pressure opponents on the boards, might force him to do exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"If a guy is running up the wall...I can force him to make a play, put them under pressure,\" Dach said. \"Pucks are going to come loose, and hopefully my feet are pointed up the ice and I can get going.\"&lt;/p&gt;",

JB Pritzker just put a &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/springfield/2026/02/18/jb-pritzker-budget-proposal-state-of-state-social-media-tax\"   &gt;$56 billion&lt;/a&gt; general fund budget proposal for fiscal year 2027 on the table. Of that amount, roughly $16.2 billion, or 29%, covers “hard costs” the state must pay, because they’re either required by law, such as debt service owed to bondholders, or contractual obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That leaves $39.8 billion to fund services for the year, with 95% of those service expenditures targeted to the four core areas of education (pre-K, K-12 and higher education), health care (primarily Medicaid coverage for low-income families), social services and public safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As governors are wont to do, Pritzker made a point of emphasizing his fiscal accomplishments during the budget speech. Usually, when elected officials crow about their performance, there’s a fair bit of spin that has to be unwound before the reality of that performance is laid bare. Not so in this case. The data shows Pritzker has been a truly responsible fiscal steward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Pritzker’s watch, the state has garnered &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://gov-pritzker-newsroom.prezly.com/illinois-achieves-10th-rating-upgrade-since-governor-pritzker-took-office\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;10 consecutive credit upgrades&lt;/a&gt;, which happen to be the first such upgrades for Illinois in the last 25 years. That’s a far cry from the eight &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2021/7/2/22561261/illinois-credit-downgrade-history-springfield-rich-miller\"   &gt;downgrades Illinois suffered&lt;/a&gt; under his predecessor, Gov. Bruce Rauner, who left Pritzker an $8 billion backlog of unpaid bills and next to nothing in Illinois’ rainy day fund. Pritzker completely eliminated that unpaid bill backlog, built the rainy day fund up to $2.4 billion while also paying off some $12 billion in debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-0d0000\" name=\"module-0d0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule-title\"&gt;Columnist &lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Columnist&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pritzker’s budget address wasn’t all sunshine and lollipops. Categorizing FY 2027 as a “challenging” budget year, Pritzker proposed increasing general fund service expenditures by less than “one-half of 1 percent” over last year, that is if you ignore inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just like in the private sector, inflation drives up the cost of funding services in the public sector. After adjusting for inflation, proposed FY 2027 spending for the four core services is actually about 1% less than this year. Illinois’ fiscal condition is so “challenging” that Pritzker had to include $649 million in new revenue-generating initiatives in his budget proposal, just to limit the year-to-year real spending cut to 1 percentage point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor laid much blame for Illinois’ FY 2027 fiscal challenges at the feet of President Donald Trump, claiming the tax cuts, Medicaid cuts, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, cuts in the president’s “Big Beautiful Bill” will cost Illinois some&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://gov-pritzker-newsroom.prezly.com/gov-pritzker-proposes-eighth-balanced-budget\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt; $8.4 billion&lt;/a&gt; to backfill over the next five years. And that estimate actually understates the long-term problem. Beginning in FY 2028 and continuing thereafter, the average annual cost to Illinois of fully compensating for all the damage done in Trump’s \"Big Beautiful Bill\" hits $4.43 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s appropriate to blame Trump for fiscal difficulties his ill-conceived policies create for all 50 states, in Illinois, Trump’s shenanigans have simply exacerbated a longstanding “structural deficit” that’s historically plagued the general fund. Illinois’ structural deficit exists because state tax policy is so flawed it doesn’t align with the modern economy. Hence, general fund revenue consistently grows at a slower rate than needed to cover inflation-adjusted increases in the cost of maintaining service levels over time. Worse, Illinois unfairly overtaxes low- and middle-income folks, while under-taxing the wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And contrary to common belief, overspending hasn’t caused Illinois’ structural deficit. In fact, after inflation, spending on the four core services is 13% less under Pritzker’s FY 2027 proposed budget than it actually was under Republican Gov. George Ryan back in FY 2000. That’s problematic because current spending levels aren’t even adequate to cover existing needs. While space doesn’t permit listing all public services the data show are inadequately funded, two of the more compelling examples involve education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with K-12. The good news is Illinois ties school funding to paying for educational practices the evidence shows actually improve student achievement. The bad news is K-12 funding is $3.2 billion less than what the evidence indicates is needed to provide every child a quality education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there’s higher education. After inflation, proposed general fund spending for higher education in FY 2027 is 43% less than actual spending was in FY 2000. This disinvestment makes no sense. Why? Well, in 1979, a full-time worker with a bachelor’s degree earned 38% more than a high school grad. By 2020, that wage gap more than doubled to 85%. Underfunding higher deducation puts Illinois at a competitive disadvantage in the modern economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there are textbook approaches to tax reform that’d simultaneously eliminate the structural deficit and tax people more fairly. But for decades state politicians have avoided fixing tax policy, choosing instead to demagogue the issue. That scores political points but doesn’t solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: Illinois will never overcome its structural fiscal challenges and invest adequately in core public services, until elected officials put politics aside and fix tax policy to work in the modern economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ralph Martire is&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.ctbaonline.org/about/ctba-staff\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;executive director&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.ctbaonline.org/\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Center for Tax and Budget Accountability&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, a nonpartisan fiscal policy think tank, and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.roosevelt.edu/profile/rmartire\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;i&gt;Arthur Rubloff Professor of Public Policy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;at Roosevelt University.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RichTextSidebarModule Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"module-e80000\" name=\"module-e80000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n    &lt;div class=\"RichTextModule-items RichTextBody\"&gt;Send letters to &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;letters@suntimes.com&lt;/a&gt;.

But they're now riding high on their momentum from beating Kenwood to another showdown with Downers Grove North. Tuesday's game will be the third matchup between the two teams this season and the Trojans are 2-0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Red Devils have one of the area's best seniors in Katherine Skinner. She scored 25 in the regional championship — Hinsdale Central's first since 2015 — against the Broncos. She's one of the best defenders in the area and will need to deliver a strong performance to keep the Red Devils' season going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophomore guard Riley Orozco is an impressive floor spacer who was a West Suburban Silver All-Conference selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lane's rise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lane is better than its record indicates. I saw the Champions play in the city playoffs against Young and came away impressed despite Lane's loss. The Champions are at their worst when they turn the ball over, which leads to them losing the possession game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when they keep the turnovers low, the Champions are a formidable team. Sophomore Anais Harris is supremely impressive as a rebounder. She creates so many second-chance opportunities just off her hustle and activity around the rim. She's averaging 7.6 rebounds per game and is an impressive finisher in the paint. Sophomore Vega Ransom-Marks is an impressive scorer with a nice touch on her floaters and is adept at creating scoring chances for her teammates with her passing vision. Ransom-Marks is averaging 13.5 points on 42% shooting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lane has a chance to advance to the sectional championship if it can beat a balanced Maine South team on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Redhawks-Warriors part three&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naperville Central is 2-0 against Waubonsie Valley this season. For the Redhawks to keep their season going, they'll have to beat the Warriors a third time, which is hard to do. There's a familiarity between the teams after playing each other numerous times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's intriguing about this matchup is that each team boasts marquee players: Naperville Central senior forward Trinity Jones (Clemson) and Danyella Mporokoso (Illinois State). Mporokoso averaged 28.6 points this season and is one of the area’s best scorers. But Jones, a McDonald’s All-American, can also score with the best of them while being a deterrent on the defensive end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game will likely be decided by how well the Warriors can defend the Redhawks’ forwards — Jones and junior 6-4 forward Annabelle Kritzer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Super 25, with record and last week’s ranking:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1.

The two had left a nearby tavern when Hill and the 17-year-old allegedly attacked them, police said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tirado was fatally shot, and his friend, a 38-year-old man, was punched in the face. The friend got out of the Hyundai Sonata and Hill and the teenager fled in the car, according to police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than an hour later and 12 miles south in Oakland, Kellum was in his car in the 3700 block of South Lake Park Avenue when Hill and the 17-year-old allegedly fatally shot him, police said.

It doesn’t hurt that he played 266 games at first, but only eight last season for Yakult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murakami was positioned one step in front of the first base bag while facing the mound when holding runners, then pivoting and squared toward home plate as the pitch was being delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venable wanted to give Murakami wanted to give ample time at first before he leaves for Japan, where he’s expected to play third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I'm feeling healthy and good, I'll try to play every single game that's out there,” said Murakami, who went 0-for-2 with a strikeout Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Homework on ABS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox will be somewhat selective in using the Automated Ball-Strike System (ABS) they used successfully on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox have studied data from the 2025 season at the Triple-A level, examining what type of pitches and locations have worked, as well as the best time to issue a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Guys have an understanding, and we want to use this time in camp to fine-tune our strategy,” Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catcher Edgar Quero said bench coach Walker McKinven has reviewed the system with the catchers, adding, “if we 100 percent (believe) it’s going to be a strike, we can challenge.” But in most cases, they might save challenges for the last inning in key situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each team has two challenges, which can be retained if the call is overturned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Boxed in&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venable has received mix messages from umpires regarding enforcement of the coaches’ box, in which umpires must insure that coaches are “within their designated areas” while the pitcher is on the rubber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our understanding now is that it’s really going to be the depth or the proximity to the foul line and to home plate, where then you have space to go back away from the foul line or away from home plate,” Venable said. “That’s what we’re expecting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule puts third base coach Justin Jirschele in a tough spot with a runner at second base, Venable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sox 5, Brewers 2&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Dru Baker, Sam Antonacci and Drew Romo collected RBI hits during a three-run sixth that helped overcome a 2-1 deficit. Austin Hays, battling for playing time at the corner outfield spots, led off the second with a double and scored on Curtis Mead’s single.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Catcher Korey Lee, who is out of options and could be the odd man out in a two-catcher alignment, nailed two would-be base stealers. Antonacci, however, bobbled a potential double-play grounder at second in the fifth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Mike Vasil, battling for a spot in the back end of the rotation, threw 18 pitches to the first three batters and was disappointed that he fell constantly behind in counts. He left after 26 pitches with two out in the first, but returned in the second for 16 more pitches before being pulled in favor of Luke Bell with two out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On deck: Sox at Rockies, 2:10 p.m. Monday, Scottsdale, Shane Smith vs. Michael Lorenzen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

He wants to know what he needs to get better at. So we see his incredible on base skills, his ability to take a walk, get hit by a pitch, hit a single, steal second base, create havoc.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those traits were on display in 519 plate appearances at Class-A Winston-Salem and Double-A Birmingham, in which Antonacci posted a .433 on-base percentage, an 86.8 percent contact rate and a 13.3 percent walk rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His on-base percentage was aided by getting hit by pitches 35 times, but that didn’t slow him down as he stole 48 bases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More impressive was that the left-handed hitting Antonacci, 23, showed no signs of slowing down. He led the Arizona Fall League with 28 hits and 24 runs in addition to batting .378 in 74 at-bats, and MLB Pipeline ranked him as the 11th top prospect in the organization despite not being picked until the fifth round in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Honestly, I kind of have an unorthodox way of training, especially hitting in the offseason,” Antonacci said. “I like to hit quite a bit, and I like to hit when I'm tired, too. So whether that's like 300 to 500 swings in a day, and I'm tired on half of those.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people think like when you're tired, you're going to develop bad habits, but my thought process is when I'm swinging tired in the cage with my dad, it's I'm preparing to play in October and those those cold nights in the playoffs. So I'm going to be tired during the end, so I might as well practice tired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antonacci also hit three home runs in the AFL - two shy of his regular season total - and hit a homer in Friday’s exhibition opener against the Cubs. The Sox will be patient about letting Antonacci create more power without compromising his hitting and on-base skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have three main skills here, our decisions, our contact, and then your damage,” Fuller said. “Sam is unbelievable with his decisions and contact, and as he's getting stronger, as he's swinging our weighted bats in our bat speed program, those are naturally going to come, and he's already showing that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But you never want to take away those inherent skills that Sammy has that are elite.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sox have a glut of young infielders, including incumbent second baseman Chase Meidroth. Antonacci has played third and shortstop as well as second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I got drafted to to help the White Sox, whatever they need,” said Antonacci, who transferred from Heartland Community College in Springfield to Coastal Carolina after the 2023 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“… Honestly, when I was in college, I was just hoping to get drafted. Obviously, I was trying to help Coastal Carolina win at that time. But once that ended, I was just hoping to be able to continue to play baseball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And at the end of the day, all the numbers, all the rankings, how much money you make, goes out the door, and once you cross those white lines, I don't know any of that. I don't know how much money you make or what draft pick you were. We're on the same field, so I got a good chance to win.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

They then marched several blocks to the archdiocese office in the Gold Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the schools are in trouble, the archdiocese is silent,” said Angel Garcia, whose child attends the school, at a news conference. “This falls on Cardinal Cupich.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours later, the Archdiocese of Chicago Office of Catholic Schools said the decision was made “with heavy hearts after months of discussions” but maintained that enrollment was too low and deficits too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"There are no plans to revisit those decisions,\" a spokesperson with the Archdiocese of Chicago Office of Catholic Schools told the Sun-Times. “Many people have worked hard at each school to raise money and try to boost enrollment. We recognize and value those efforts but, in the end, the schools were not able to close the gaps, and they are no longer sustainable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelle Flowers, a mother of four students who went to the school and is herself an alumna, said it was “deeply troubling” and hoped the archdiocese would reconsider the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first we’ve heard from them,” Flowers said of the archdiocese's statement to the Sun-Times. “They have not given us any meaningful opportunity to communicate with them. … Catholic schools are not meant to operate as balance sheets. If the archdiocese isn’t even willing to come to the table, that represents an abandonment of a mission.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"Enhancement\" data-align-center&gt;\n        &lt;div class=\"Enhancement-item\" data-crop=\"\"&gt;\n            \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                            &lt;figure class=\"Figure\"&gt;&lt;a class=\"AnchorLink\" id=\"image-2c0000\" name=\"image-2c0000\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n        &lt;picture data-crop=\"medium\"&gt;\n    \n            \n                \n\n            \n        \n\n        \n        \n            \n    \n            &lt;source type=\"image/webp\"  width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/920bcec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5877x3298+0+311/resize/490x275!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F4f%2F723d10de41ffb92a4b0e9cb7a201%2Fcatholicschool-260222-005.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/22cc0db/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5877x3298+0+311/resize/980x550!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F4f%2F723d10de41ffb92a4b0e9cb7a201%2Fcatholicschool-260222-005.jpg 2x\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;source width=\"490\"\n     height=\"275\"\n        data-srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6e4ceb5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5877x3298+0+311/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F4f%2F723d10de41ffb92a4b0e9cb7a201%2Fcatholicschool-260222-005.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" srcset=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n    /&gt;\n\n    \n\n\n        \n        \n    &lt;img class=\"Image\" alt=\"St. Hubert Catholic School alumna and parent Michelle Flowers marches with her daughter outside Holy Name Cathedral, calling for Cardinal Cupich to halt the closing of their school, Sunday, Feb. 22, 2026.\" srcset=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6e4ceb5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5877x3298+0+311/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F4f%2F723d10de41ffb92a4b0e9cb7a201%2Fcatholicschool-260222-005.jpg 1x,https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3eaf6e5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5877x3298+0+311/resize/980x550!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F4f%2F723d10de41ffb92a4b0e9cb7a201%2Fcatholicschool-260222-005.jpg 2x\" width=\"490\" height=\"275\"\n        data-src=\"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6e4ceb5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5877x3298+0+311/resize/490x275!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fef%2F4f%2F723d10de41ffb92a4b0e9cb7a201%2Fcatholicschool-260222-005.jpg\" data-lazy-load=\"true\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZlcnNpb249IjEuMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIyNzVweCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MHB4Ij48L3N2Zz4=\"\n        &gt;\n\n&lt;/picture&gt;\n\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;div class=\"Figure-content\"&gt;&lt;figcaption class=\"Figure-caption\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;St. Hubert Catholic School alumna and parent Michelle Flowers marches with her daughter outside Holy Name Cathedral, where they called for Cardinal Blase Cupich to halt the closing of their school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"line\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=\"Figure-credit\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candace Dane Chambers/Sun-Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, the archdiocese announced its intention to close the 65-year-old St. Hubert at the end of this school year.

The report found staffing costs were the biggest driver of overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They blame tuition increases and the elimination of tuition discounts, which allowed students to attend even if they could pay half of the $8,000 annual cost of attending the school, which the group said prevented nearly 50 students from enrolling at the school last year.

I think it discourages people from supporting the school, and I think that was done intentionally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Archdiocese of Chicago Office of Catholic Schools wouldn’t answer questions about the allegations made by parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/save-st-hubert-catholic-school-a-community-united\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;&lt;u&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to help fund efforts to save the school has already raised more than $20,000 of its  $500,000 goal — the deficit number diocese leaders gave as the reason why the school must close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closure would force parents to choose between public schools and the next nearest comparable Catholic schools in neighboring suburbs like Roselle or Arlington Heights, Bernas Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Contributing: David Struett&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

He finally joined Cubs camp Sunday, about a week and a half after the report date for Cubs pitchers and catchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those were things that were out of the control of the team, out of my control,” Ballesteros said Sunday through team interpreter Fredy Quevedo Jr. “Thankfully, I'm here. And I'm ready to give it my absolute best.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the first time Ballesteros had to renew his visa in five years in the Cubs organization, he said. And when the United States captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in early January, Ballesteros was anxious about what that would mean for travel outside of his home country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That didn’t end up being the issue. But the visa process dragged on. And Ballesteros spent the past week and a half in Colombia, waiting for it to be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was unfortunate how it all goes down,” manager Criag Counsell said. “He had to be patient, I think that's the biggest thing. And so now we’ve got to be a little patient here and give him some time to just run around for a bunch of days, swing the bat casually, and gradually increase the workload and swing volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But he’s here. And it’s Feb. 22. So, we’ve got plenty of time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballesteros said he had access to a nearby stadium near his hotel in Colombia, where he used the weightroom and field. He was able to still throw and swing a bat in that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not at the intensity that it happens here,” Counsell said. “So we have to understand that. And he's not in his home country. It’s one thing being stuck at home waiting to come here, and then there's being stuck somewhere else and having to come here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time in his young career, Ballesteros enters spring training with a strong shot at making the Opening Day roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He debuted last season and really found a rhythm in a September stint, when he recorded a .999 OPS in 46 plate appearances, mostly as a designated hitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He showed what got him to the big-leagues,” manager Craig Counsell said. “That’s not always easy to do in a smaller sample and right off the bat. … He's a gifted hitter, and the ball goes hard all over the field. Kind of no rhyme or reason, but that's just a sign of a good hitter. ... He's a guy that can handle a lot of pitches, a lot of different pitch types”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballesteros didn’t play in the field until the final series of the season. He played first base late in a blowout win against the Cardinals. And then after the Cubs had secured home-field advantage for the NL wild-card round, he started behind the plate in their final regular-season game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honing the defensive side of Ballesteros’ game will be the next major step in the 22-year-old’s development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I want to give it my 100%,” he said, “and show that I can also be behind the plate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That first week and a half of catching bullpens and live batting practice sessions would have been helpful. Because of the delay, Ballesteros likely won’t appear in Cubs spring training games this week. But Counsell said he expects Ballesteros to catch a lot over the next month and take some reps at first base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"I was anxious,” Ballesteros said of the extended visa process. “But I'm happy to be here, be here with my team.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

DePaul still has demons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just when you thought DePaul was getting something going, another bad-looking, gut-punch loss arrived. This one was 71-68 against Big East last-place contender Providence at Wintrust Arena on a night when the Blue Demons — in a not-bad sixth place out of 11 teams — were trying to get to seven conference wins for the first time since 2018-19 on the way, hopefully, to more than that for the first time since 2006-07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no. A 12-for-24 disaster from the foul line got in the way. Veteran guard Layden Blocker missed four freebies — the last one intentionally — in the final 20 seconds. There’s always another way to lose, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Friars sat on a plane for six hours Friday and never got the bird off the ground, then didn’t finally get to O’Hare until five hours before game time on Saturday. Advantage, DePaul? It sure looked like it when Blocker lobbed to CJ Gunn for a dunk and a six-point lead midway through the second half. But the Demons — who lead the nation in lob dunks, believe it or not — coughed up all their momentum and the game.

OK, fine, we’re asking anyway. It could go up or down from here, but right now we’d (very) tentatively slot them fifth or sixth since those Spartans. Yes, the Sun-Times made a top 10 list a couple of years back — Illinois’ 2004-05 and Ohio State’s 2006-07 teams were 1-2 — and will have to revisit it if the Wolverines finish 19-1, which would be an amazing feat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"RelatedList Enhancement\" data-module data-align-center&gt;\n    \n     &lt;div class=\"RelatedList-title\"&gt;Related&lt;/div&gt;\n    \n\n    \n        &lt;ul class=\"RelatedList-items\"&gt;\n            \n                &lt;li class=\"RelatedList-items-item\"&gt;\n                    &lt;a class=\"Link\"  href=\"https://chicago.suntimes.com/college-sports/2026/02/22/illinois-fighting-illini-college-basketball-ucla-donovan-dent-march-madness-big-ten\"  target=\"_blank\"   &gt;Illini ‘O’ is golden, but their ‘D’ keeps foldin’.
